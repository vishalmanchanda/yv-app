Absolute Truth.\n\n The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramātmā, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(..11)***\n this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus: vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate “The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identic.\n\n Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.\n\n” These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun’s surface and the sun planet itself.\n\n One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student.\n\n One who understands the sun’s surface is further advanced.\n\n And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest.\n\n Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine – its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature – may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth.\n\n The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramātmā feature of the Absolute Truth.\n\n And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavān feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter.\n\n The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.\n\n The Sanskrit word bhagavān is explained by the great authority Parāśara Muni, the father of Vyāsadeva.\n\n The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavān.\n\n There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, ., entirely.\n\n Only Kṛṣṇa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n No living entity, including Brahmā, Lord Śiva or Nārāyaṇa, can possess opulences as fully as Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is concluded in the Brahma-saṁhitā by Lord Brahmā himself that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n No one is equal to or above Him.\n\n He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavān, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes: īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam “There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavān, but Kṛṣṇa is the supreme because none can excel Him.\n\n He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss.\n\n He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.\n\n”  \n***( Brahma-saṁhitā .1)***\n In the Bhāgavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand: ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge “All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\n\n”  \n***( Bhāg.\n\n ..28)***\n \n\nTherefore, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.\n\n In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna’s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Kṛṣṇa expressed His surprise with the word kutaḥ, “wherefrom.\n\n” Such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Āryans.\n\n The word āryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization.\n\n Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, or Bhagavān, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is.\n\n Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Āryans.\n\n Although Arjuna was a kṣatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight.\n\n This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Āryans.\n\n Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world.\n\n Lord Kṛṣṇa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his

It is he who does not understand the problems of l.\n\n In the Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad  \n***(..10)***\n the perplexed man is described as follows: yo vā etad akṣaraṁ gārgy aviditvāsmāḻ lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ.\n\n “He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.\n\n” This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser.\n\n On the other hand, there is the brāhmaṇa, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of l.\n\n Ya etad akṣaraṁ gārgi viditvāsmāl lokāt praiti sa brāhmaṇaḥ.\n\n The kṛpaṇas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, ., in the material conception of l.\n\n One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of “skin disease.\n\n” The kṛpaṇa thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the kṛpaṇa thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death.\n\n Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also.\n\n Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities.\n\n Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties.\n\n He is therefore asking Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution.\n\n He offers himself to Kṛṣṇa as a disciple.\n\n He wants to stop friendly talks.\n\n Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gītā , and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the Gītā.\n\n How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-gītā is stated in the Gītā itself.\n\n And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to Kṛṣṇa as a person, but to “the unborn within Kṛṣṇa.\n\n” There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa’s within and without.\n\n And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-gītā .",

Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost.\n\n Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.\n\n And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gītā that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time  \n***( antavanta ime dehāḥ )***\n but that the soul is eternal  \n***( nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ )***\n, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress?

        "explanation": "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, saṅkhyā means that which describes things in detail, and sāṅkhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul.\n\n And yoga involves controlling the senses.\n\n Arjuna’s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification.\n\n Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra.\n\n In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification.\n\n Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.\n\n Kṛṣṇa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally.\n\n We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress.\n\n An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Kṛṣṇa.\n\n And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as Sāṅkhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary.\n\n This Sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the Sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila.\n\n Long before the imposter Kapila’s Sāṅkhya, the Sāṅkhya philosophy was expounded in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who explained it to His mother, Devahūti.\n\n It is clearly explained by Him that the puruṣa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakṛti.\n\n This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gītā.\n\n The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakṛti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls.\n\n All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers.\n\n This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord.\n\n This is the last snare of māyā, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.\n\n Arjuna has already accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: śiṣyas te ’haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam.\n\n Consequently, Kṛṣṇa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord.\n\n This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramātmā in everyone’s heart.\n\n But such communion does not take place without devotional serv.\n\n One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord.\n\n The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love.\n\n In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\n\n \n\nThus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word Sāṅkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila.\n\n One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sāṅkhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic Sāṅkhya.\n\n Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Kṛṣṇa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations.\n\n Real Sāṅkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , but even that Sāṅkhya has nothing to do with the current topics.\n\n Here, Sāṅkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul.\n\n Lord Kṛṣṇa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga.\n\n \n\nTherefore, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Sāṅkhya and Lord Kapila’s Sāṅkhya, as described in the Bhāgavatam , are one and the same.\n\n They are all bhakti-yoga.\n\n Lord Kṛṣṇa said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sāṅkhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga  \n***( sāṅkhya-yogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ )***\n.\n\n Of course, atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic sāṅkhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gītā . One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional serv.\n\n One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss.\n\n By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge.\n\n There is much difference between work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness.\n\n Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.",

The Gītā is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemori.\n\n In the Mahābhārata  \n***( Śānti-parva 34.51–52)***\n we can trace out the history of the Gītā as follows: tretā-yugādau ca tato vivasvān manave dadau manuś ca loka-bhṛty-arthaṁ sutāyekṣvākave dadau ikṣvākuṇā ca kathito vyāpya lokān avasthitaḥ “In the beginning of the millennium known as Tretā-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvān to Manu.\n\n Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord Rāmacandra appeared.\n\n” \n\nTherefore, Bhagavad-gītā existed in human society from the time of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku.\n\n At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432, 000 years.\n\n Before this there was Dvāpara-yuga  \n***(800, 000 years)***\n, and before that there was Tretā-yuga  \n***(1, 200, 000 years)***\n.\n\n \n\nThus, some 2, 005, 000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to his disciple and son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the king of this planet earth.\n\n The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305, 300, 000 years, of which 120, 400, 000 have passed.\n\n Accepting that before the birth of Manu the Gītā was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that the Gītā was spoken at least 120, 400, 000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years.\n\n It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago.\n\n That is the rough estimate of the history of the Gītā, according to the Gītā itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.\n\n It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvān because he is also a kṣatriya and is the father of all kṣatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the sūrya-vaṁśa kṣatriyas.\n\n Because Bhagavad-gītā is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruṣeya, superhuman.\n\n Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the Gītā must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation.\n\n The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gītā in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gītā as it is.\n\n \n\nTherefore, Bhagavad-gītā has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku.",

The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gītā, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more.\n\n The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears.\n\n From the Bhāgavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas.\n\n Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles.\n\n Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence.\n\n \n\nTherefore each and every avatāra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures.\n\n No one should be accepted as an avatāra unless he is referred to by scriptures.\n\n It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil.\n\n He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear.\n\n In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances.\n\n But the mission is the same – to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion.\n\n Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.\n\n The principles of the Bhagavad-gītā were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world.\n\n Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner’s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well.\n\n Still, there are higher and lower mathematics.\n\n In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances.\n\n The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later.\n\n The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere.\n\n Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.",

Nor does cessation of material existence entail one’s entering into “the void, ” which is only a myth.\n\n There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord.\n\n Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord.\n\n The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-gītā as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity.\n\n All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky.\n\n The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called paraṁ dhāma, or superior abodes.\n\n A consummate yogī, who is perfect in understanding Lord Kṛṣṇa, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself  \n***( mat-cittaḥ, mat-paraḥ, mat-sthānam )***\n, can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, Kṛṣṇaloka, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana.\n\n In the Brahma-saṁhitā  \n***(.37)***\n it is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ: the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Paramātmā as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies.\n\n No one can reach the spiritual sky  \n***(Vaikuṇṭha)***\n or enter into the Lord’s eternal abode  \n***(Goloka Vṛndāvana)***\n without the proper understanding of Kṛṣṇa and His plenary expansion Viṣṇu.\n\n \n\nTherefore a person working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the perfect yogī, because his mind is always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa’s activities  \n***( sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ )***\n.\n\n In the Vedas also  \n***( Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad .8)***\n we learn, tam eva viditvāti mṛtyum eti: “One can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n” In other words, perfection of the yoga system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.",

The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge.\n\n These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind.\n\n Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga.\n\n In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later.\n\n This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance.\n\n Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization.\n\n To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kṛṣṇa to confirm His former statement.\n\n One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age.\n\n \n\nTherefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons.\n\n First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following the process.\n\n To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy.\n\n Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements.\n\n A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines.\n\n This is called yogāc calita-mānasaḥ: deviation from the transcendental path.\n\n Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.",

Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ: “Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa.\n\n” Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-gītā without an attitude of service to the Lord.\n\n Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word “worshi.\n\n” The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga.\n\n All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga.\n\n Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga.\n\n From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization.\n\n Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path.\n\n When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called jñāna-yoga.\n\n When jñāna-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called aṣṭāṅga-yoga.\n\n And when one surpasses the aṣṭāṅga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination.\n\n Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas.\n\n The yogī who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune.\n\n One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī or dhyāna-yogī, rāja-yogī, haṭha-yogī, . If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas.\n\n \n\nTherefore, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Himālayan, we refer to the world’s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\n\n It is by great fortune that one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction.\n\n The ideal yogī concentrates his attention on Kṛṣṇa, who is called Śyāmasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded.\n\n Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahma-jyotir.\n\n He incarnates in different forms such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Yaśodā, and He is known as Kṛṣṇa, Govinda and Vāsudeva.\n\n He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities.\n\n If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yogī.\n\n This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as is confirmed in all Vedic literature: yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ “Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\n\n”  \n***( Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad .23)***\n Bhaktir asya bhajanaṁ tad ihāmutropādhi-nairāsyenāmuṣmin manaḥ-kalpanam, etad eva naiṣkarmyam.\n\n “ Bhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next.\n\n Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme.\n\n That is the purpose of naiṣkarmya.\n\n ”  \n***( Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad .15)***\n These are some of the means for performance of bhakti, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Sixth Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of Dhyāna-yoga.",

        "explanation": "The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies.\n\n Material nature is called prakṛti, or the energy of the Lord in His different puruṣa incarnations  \n***(expansions)***\n as described in the Nārada Pañcarātra, one of the Sātvata-tantras: viṣṇos tu trīṇi rūpāṇi puruṣākhyāny atho viduḥ ekaṁ tu mahataḥ sraṣṭṛ dvitīyaṁ tv aṇḍa-saṁsthitam tṛtīyaṁ sarva-bhūta-sthaṁ tāni jñātvā vimucyate “For material creation, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s plenary expansion assumes three Viṣṇus.\n\n The first one, Mahā-viṣṇu, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva.\n\n The second, Garbhodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them.\n\n The third, Kṣīrodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Paramātmā.\n\n He is present even within the atoms.\n\n Anyone who knows these three Viṣṇus can be liberated from material entanglement.\n\n” This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord.\n\n All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Viṣṇu expansions of Lord Kṛṣṇa.\n\n These puruṣas are called incarnations.\n\n Generally one who does not know the science of God  \n***(Kṛṣṇa)***\n assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the puruṣas – the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy.\n\n According to Bhagavad-gītā this atheistic conclusion is false.\n\n In the verse under discussion it is stated that Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of the material manifestation.\n\n Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also confirms this.\n\n The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord.\n\n Even the brahma-jyotir, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky.\n\n There are no spiritual diversities in the brahma-jyotir as there are in the Vaikuṇṭha-lokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahma-jyotir as the ultimate eternal go.\n\n The Paramātmā manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the Kṣīrodaka-śāyī Viṣṇu.\n\n The Paramātmā manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world.\n\n \n\nTherefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa.\n\n He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.\n\n In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned.\n\n Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included.\n\n They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell.\n\n Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more.\n\n But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists.\n\n Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n The false ego – “I am, ” and “It is mine, ” which constitute the basic principle of material existence – includes ten sense organs for material activities.\n\n Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva.\n\n \n\nTherefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of Sāṅkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from Kṛṣṇa’s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic Sāṅkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes.\n\n The subject matter for discussion in the Sāṅkhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Kṛṣṇa, as it is described in the Bhagavad-gītā .",

If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control.\n\n But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control.\n\n \n\nTherefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy.\n\n In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.\n\n \n\nTherefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and polluted opinion.\n\n” The Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him.\n\n These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power.\n\n While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy  \n***(matter)***\n, the superior energy  \n***(the living entity)***\n forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence.\n\n This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity.\n\n But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation.\n\n The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, “I am matter, and material acquisitions are m.\n\n” His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God.\n\n \n\nTherefore one may conclude that the Gītā confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of Kṛṣṇa; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, or liberated.",

        "explanation": "It is said in Bhagavad-gītā that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality Kṛṣṇa one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature.\n\n At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births.\n\n But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don’t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method? The Gītā answers this question very frankly.\n\n Those really learned leaders of society like Brahmā, Śiva, Kapila, the Kumāras, Manu, Vyāsa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahlāda, Bali, and later on Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Śrī Caitanya and many others – who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, . – surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority.\n\n Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, ., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord.\n\n They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them.\n\n Because material energy  \n***(nature)***\n is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of “planning commissions.\n\n” The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word duṣkṛtinaḥ, or “miscreants.\n\n” Kṛtī means one who has performed meritorious work.\n\n The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute.\n\n But because the atheist’s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called duṣkṛtī, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.\n\n In the Gītā it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord.\n\n It has no independent authority.\n\n It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object.\n\n But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord.\n\n Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraṇyakaśipu and Rāvaṇa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators.\n\n These duṣkṛtinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below.\n\n  \n***(1)***\n The mūḍhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden.\n\n They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme.\n\n The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass.\n\n This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master.\n\n The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night.\n\n He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party.\n\n The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others.\n\n This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work.\n\n He does not know that karma  \n***(action)***\n is meant for yajña  \n***(sacrifice)***\n.\n\n Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being.\n\n To such mūḍhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life’s all in all – despite the fact that the mūḍhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor.\n\n Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food;

The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Narādhamas, or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.\n\n  \n***(3)***\n The next class of duṣkṛtī is called māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ, or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy.\n\n They are mostly very learned fellows – great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, . – but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.\n\n There are a great number of māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the Bhagavad-gītā . In the Gītā, in plain and simple language, it is stated that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n There is none equal to or greater than Him.\n\n He is mentioned as the father of Brahmā, the original father of all human beings.\n\n In fact, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is said to be not only the father of Brahmā but also the father of all species of l.\n\n He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramātmā; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion.\n\n He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet.\n\n Despite all these clear statements, the māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being.\n\n They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.\n\n All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gītā by the class of māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ, outside the purview of the paramparā system, are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding.\n\n The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.\n\n  \n***(4)***\n The last class of duṣkṛtī is called āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ, or those of demonic principles.\n\n This class is openly atheistic.\n\n Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not.\n\n There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the Gītā.\n\n Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain.\n\n Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Śrī Yāmunācārya Ālabandaru of South India said, “O my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your uncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality’s being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities.\n\n” \n\nTherefore,  \n***(1)***\n grossly foolish persons,  \n***(2)***\n the lowest of mankind,  \n***(3)***\n the deluded speculators and  \n***(4)***\n the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative adv.",

Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of vānaprastha, he undergoes severe penances – living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, . By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya, householder life, vānaprastha and finally sannyāsa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of l.\n\n Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahma-jyotir or in the Vaikuṇṭha planets or Kṛṣṇaloka.\n\n This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\n\n The beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of l.\n\n The words idaṁ viditvā indicate that one should understand the instructions given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā . One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees.\n\n Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-gītā . The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord.\n\n If one is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-gītā – especially these middle six chapters – in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, ., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n One who has a little faith in Bhagavad-gītā should learn Bhagavad-gītā from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that Bhagavad-gītā can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-gītā . One should therefore learn Bhagavad-gītā from a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, not from mental speculators.\n\n This is a sign of faith.\n\n When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee’s association one actually begins to study and understand Bhagavad-gītā . By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one’s misgivings about Kṛṣṇa, or God, and Kṛṣṇa’s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features.\n\n After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study.\n\n Then one relishes the study of Bhagavad-gītā and attains the state of feeling always Kṛṣṇa conscious.\n\n In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to Kṛṣṇa’s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Vṛndāvana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Eighth Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.",

        "explanation": "This chapter of Bhagavad-gītā is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before.\n\n Among the principal philosophers in India are Gautama, Kaṇāda, Kapila, Yājñavalkya, Śāṇḍilya and Vaiśvānara.\n\n And finally there is Vyāsadeva, the author of the Vedānta-sūtra.\n\n So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge.\n\n \n\nNow the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy.\n\n It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body.\n\n And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional serv.\n\n Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge.\n\n As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, . There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed.\n\n Yet the soul is the most important part of the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value.\n\n Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.\n\n The Bhagavad-gītā , especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul.\n\n In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable  \n***( antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ )***\n.\n\n That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and etern.\n\n But that gives no positive information about the soul.\n\n Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes imperson.\n\n But actually that is not the fact.\n\n How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always act.\n\n If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge.\n\n These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.\n\n This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature.\n\n In the Padma Purāṇa, man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin.\n\n Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions.\n\n For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some t.\n\n It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree.\n\n Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify.\n\n There are different stages.\n\n The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed.\n\n There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain.\n\n As explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions.\n\n This statement is confirmed in the Padma Purāṇa: aprārabdha-phalaṁ pāpaṁ kūṭaṁ bījaṁ phalonmukham krameṇaiva pralīyeta viṣṇu-bhakti-ratātmanām For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish.\n\n \n\nTherefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest.\n\n Uttama means transcendent.\n\n Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttama means that which is transcendental to material activities.\n\n Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men.\n\n One who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities.\n\n They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.\n\n It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly.\n\n This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa  \n***(Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare)***\n in course of chanting without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination.\n\n This is actually seen.\n\n Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress.\n\n This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification.\n\n The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.\n\n In the Vedānta-sūtra  \n***(..26)***\n this is also described in the following words: prakāśaś ca karmaṇy abhyāsāt.\n\n “Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt.\n\n” A practical example of this can be seen in the previous life of Nārada, who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant.\n\n He had no education, nor was he born into a high family.\n\n But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, Nārada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself.\n\n Nārada personally says, ucchiṣṭa-lepān anumodito dvijaiḥ sakṛt sma bhuñje tad-apāsta-kilbiṣaḥ evaṁ pravṛttasya viśuddha-cetasas tad-dharma evātma-ruciḥ prajāyate In this verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(..25)***\n Nārada describes his previous life to his disciple Vyāsadeva.\n\n He says that while engaged as a boy servant for those purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately associating with them.\n\n Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants.\n\n So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they gave it Nārada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions.\n\n As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as the sages.\n\n The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service to the Lord by hearing and chanting, and Nārada gradually developed the same taste.\n\n Nārada says further, tatrānv-ahaṁ kṛṣṇa-kathāḥ pragāyatām anugraheṇāśṛṇavaṁ mano-harāḥ tāḥ śraddhayā me ’nu-padaṁ viśṛṇvataḥ priyaśravasy aṅga mamābhavad ruciḥ By associating with the sages, Nārada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional serv.\n\n \n\nTherefore, as described in the Vedānta-sūtra, prakāśaś ca karmaṇy abhyāsāt: if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand.\n\n This is called pratyakṣa, directly perceived.\n\n The word dharmyam means “the path of religion.\n\n” Nārada was actually a son of a maidservant.\n\n He had no opportunity to go to school.\n\n He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees.\n\n The child Nārada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion.\n\n The highest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***( sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje )***\n.\n\n Religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional serv.\n\n As we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight  \n***( vedeṣu yajñeṣu tapaḥsu caiva )***\n, generally Vedic knowledge is required for self-realization.\n\n But here, although Nārada never went to the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the highest results of Vedic study.\n\n This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection.\n\n How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: ācāryavān puruṣo veda.\n\n One who is in association with great ācāryas, even if he is not educated or has never studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization.\n\n The process of devotional service is a very happy one  \n***( su-sukham )***\n.\n\n Why? Devotional service consists of śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized ācāryas.\n\n Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes.\n\n In every state devotional service is joyful.\n\n One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition.\n\n The Lord says, patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what.\n\n Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love.\n\n There are many instances in history.\n\n Simply by tasting the tulasī leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumāra became great devotees.\n\n \n\nTherefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood.\n\n God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.\n\n It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing.\n\n It is not as the Māyāvādī philosophers claim.\n\n Although they sometimes take to so-called devotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they will “become one with God.\n\n” Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional serv.\n\n Actual devotional service continues even after liberation.\n\n When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord.\n\n He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.\n\n As will be seen in Bhagavad-gītā , actual devotional service begins after liberation.\n\n After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman position  \n***( brahma-bhūta )***\n, one’s devotional service begins  \n***( samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām )***\n.\n\n No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga, aṣṭāṅga-yoga or any other yoga independently.\n\n By these yogic methods one may make a little progress toward bhakti-yoga, but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam or Bhagavad-gītā from realized souls, then he can understand the science of Kṛṣṇa, or the science of God.\n\n Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ.\n\n When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is.\n\n \n\nThus the process of devotional service, of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge.\n\n It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty.\n\n \n\nTherefore one should adopt it.",

        "explanation": "The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse.\n\n Faith is created by association with devotees.\n\n Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God.\n\n They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord.\n\n \n\nThus faith is a most important factor for progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one can achieve all perfection.\n\n That is called real faith.\n\n As stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(.3.14)***\n , yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇāṁ tathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā “By giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body.\n\n Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord one automatically satisfies all the demigods and all other living entities.\n\n” \n\nTherefore, after reading Bhagavad-gītā one should promptly come to the conclusion of Bhagavad-gītā : one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead.\n\n If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.\n\n \n\nNow, the development of that faith is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n There are three divisions of Kṛṣṇa conscious men.\n\n In the third class are those who have no faith.\n\n Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage.\n\n Most probably they will slip, after some t.\n\n They may become engaged, but because they haven’t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to Kṛṣṇa consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again.\n\n It is only by faith that one can advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that kṛṣṇa-bhakti, or service to Kṛṣṇa, is the best course and so in good faith have taken it u.\n\n \n\nThus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow.\n\n The third-class person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no chance of falling down.\n\n One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end.\n\n As far as the third-class person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to Kṛṣṇa is very good, he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of Kṛṣṇa through the scriptures like Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Bhagavad-gītā . Sometimes these third-class persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and jñāna-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or jñāna-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n Faith in Kṛṣṇa is also divided into three stages and described in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam . First-class attachment, second-class attachment and third-class attachment are also explained in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in the Eleventh Canto.\n\n Those who have no faith even after hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional serv.\n\n For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection.\n\n \n\nThus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional serv.",

        "explanation": "From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man.\n\n The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being.\n\n Yet there are many foolish men who consider Kṛṣṇa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more.\n\n Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-saṁhitā  \n***( īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ )***\n; He is the Supreme Lord.\n\n There are many īśvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another.\n\n In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president.\n\n Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another.\n\n In the Brahma-saṁhitā it is said that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller  \n***( īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ )***\n, and His body is sac-cid-ānanda, nonmateri.\n\n Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses.\n\n His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge.\n\n Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man.\n\n His body is called here mānuṣīm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna’s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kurukṣetra.\n\n In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha – eternal bliss and knowledge absolute.\n\n This is confirmed in the Vedic language also.\n\n Sac-cid-ānanda-rūpāya kṛṣṇāya: “I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.\n\n”  \n***( Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad .1)***\n There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also.\n\n Tam ekaṁ govindam: “You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.\n\n” Sac-cid-ānanda-vigraham: “And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.\n\n”  \n***( Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad .38)***\n Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-gītā who deride Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary man.\n\n The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is due to a poor fund of knowledge.\n\n \n\nTherefore he is called mūḍha, for only foolish persons consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being.\n\n The foolish consider Kṛṣṇa an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies.\n\n They do not know that Kṛṣṇa’s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone.\n\n Because they do not know that Kṛṣṇa has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.\n\n Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy.\n\n He is the master of the material energy.\n\n As has been explained in several places  \n***( mama māyā duratyayā )***\n, He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy.\n\n If a soul surrendered to Kṛṣṇa can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of Kṛṣṇa is complete foolishness.\n\n Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form.\n\n The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute.\n\n Actually, although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation.\n\n It is clearly stated concerning His yogam aiśvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them.\n\n Although the foolish cannot imagine how Kṛṣṇa, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n \n\nTherefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\n\n There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord’s appearance as a human being.\n\n But if we consult Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , the authoritative texts for understanding the science of Kṛṣṇa, then we can understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by Śaunaka inquired about the activities of Kṛṣṇa, they said: kṛtavān kila karmāṇi saha rāmeṇa keśavaḥ ati-martyāni bhagavān gūḍhaḥ kapaṭa-māṇuṣaḥ “Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balarāma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.\n\n”  \n***( Bhāg.\n\n ..20)***\n The Lord’s appearance as a man bewilders the foolish.\n\n No human being could perform the wonderful acts that Kṛṣṇa performed while He was present on this earth.\n\n When Kṛṣṇa appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devakī, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\n\n As stated in the Bhāgavatam  \n***(1.46)***\n, babhūva prākṛtaḥ śiśuḥ: He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being.\n\n \n\nNow, here again it is indicated that the Lord’s appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body.\n\n In the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see Kṛṣṇa’s form of four hands  \n***( tenaiva rūpeṇa catur-bhujena )***\n.\n\n After revealing this form, Kṛṣṇa, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form  \n***( mānuṣaṁ rūpam )***\n.\n\n These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.\n\n Some of those who deride Kṛṣṇa and who are infected with the Māyāvādī philosophy quote the following verse from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(.2.21)***\n to prove that Kṛṣṇa is just an ordinary man.\n\n Ahaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu bhūtātmāvasthitaḥ sadā: “The Supreme is present in every living entity.\n\n” We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vaiṣṇava ācāryas like Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Jīva Gosvāmī, commenting on this verse, says that Kṛṣṇa, in His plenary expansion as Paramātmā, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arcā-mūrti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple.\n\n There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage.\n\n The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected.\n\n A devotee should see that because Kṛṣṇa is present in everyone’s heart as Paramātmā, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the Paramātmā dwells.\n\n Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.\n\n There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worshi.\n\n They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows that although Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the Brahma-saṁhitā.\n\n Although His personal abode is Goloka Vṛndāvana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.",

That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature.\n\n That is the qualification.\n\n One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n That is the preliminary formula.\n\n Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature.\n\n The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daivī prakṛti, divine nature.\n\n So when one is promoted in that way – by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead – one attains to the stage of great soul, mahātmā.\n\n The mahātmā does not divert his attention to anything outside Kṛṣṇa, because he knows perfectly well that Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes.\n\n There is no doubt about it.\n\n Such a mahātmā, or great soul, develops through association with other mahātmās, pure devotees.\n\n Pure devotees are not even attracted by Kṛṣṇa’s other features, such as the four-armed Mahā-viṣṇu.\n\n They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n They are not attracted to other features of Kṛṣṇa, nor are they concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being.\n\n They meditate only upon Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.",

He is described in a different way in the next verse.\n\n The mahātmā is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , hearing and chanting about Viṣṇu, not a demigod or human being.\n\n That is devotion: śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ and smaraṇam, remembering Him.\n\n Such a mahātmā has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas.\n\n To achieve that success, he engages all activities – mental, bodily and vocal, everything – in the service of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.\n\n That is called full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ekādaśī, and on the appearance day of the Lord.\n\n All these rules and regulations are offered by the great ācāryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world.\n\n The mahātmās, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.\n\n As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional service easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood.\n\n One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity.\n\n He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a sannyāsī or a brahmacārī; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mahātmā, a great soul.",

Kṛṣṇa wants only loving service and nothing more.\n\n Kṛṣṇa accepts even a little flower from His pure devotee.\n\n He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee.\n\n He is not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection.\n\n To develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest perfection of l.\n\n Bhakti is mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that bhakti, or devotional service, is the only means to approach Kṛṣṇa.\n\n No other condition, such as becoming a brāhmaṇa, a learned scholar, a very rich man or a great philosopher, can induce Kṛṣṇa to accept some offering.\n\n Without the basic principle of bhakti, nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept anything from anyone.\n\n Bhakti is never caus.\n\n The process is etern.\n\n It is direct action in service to the absolute whole.\n\n Here Lord Kṛṣṇa, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered.\n\n If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life – the transcendental loving service of God – then one should find out what the Lord desires of him.\n\n One who loves Kṛṣṇa will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked.\n\n \n\nThus meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so.\n\n Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, “I will accept it.\n\n” \n\nTherefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs.\n\n Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself.\n\n Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it.\n\n \n\nThus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.\n\n In the Third Chapter, verse 13, Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement.\n\n Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin.\n\n In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature.\n\n But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking.\n\n Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love.\n\n Kṛṣṇa has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way.\n\n The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kṛṣṇa.\n\n The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gītā . To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Kṛṣṇa, the speaker of the Bhagavad-gītā . But, in actuality, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other.\n\n This is what it means to say that Kṛṣṇa is absolute.\n\n Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences.\n\n In the Seventh Chapter, Kṛṣṇa has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature.\n\n This is done by His looking upon material nature.\n\n And so in this instance, Kṛṣṇa’s hearing the devotee’s words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting.\n\n This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting.\n\n Only the devotee, who accepts Kṛṣṇa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.",

But this is not discrimination; it is natur.\n\n Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children.\n\n The Lord claims that every living entity – in whatever form – is His son, and so He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of l.\n\n He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water.\n\n But for His devotees, He gives specific attention.\n\n Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in Kṛṣṇa.\n\n The very phrase “Kṛṣṇa consciousness” suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him.\n\n The Lord says here distinctly, mayi te: “They are in Me.\n\n” Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them.\n\n This is reciproc.\n\n This also explains the words ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham: “Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.\n\n” This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious.\n\n When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very n.\n\n The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified.\n\n The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold.\n\n The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very n.\n\n Living entities in a pure state are called devotees.\n\n The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees.\n\n If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy.\n\n In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.\n\n The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies.\n\n But here the explanation is more complete.\n\n The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees.\n\n This is the manifestation of the Lord’s special mercy to the devotees.\n\n The Lord’s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma.\n\n It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function.\n\n Devotional service to the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world, where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.",

        "explanation": "The word su-durācāraḥ used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly.\n\n When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitution.\n\n As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called condition.\n\n Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendent.\n\n Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional serv.\n\n \n\nNow, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another.\n\n But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another.\n\n As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition.\n\n He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically.\n\n But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and excuses him from that abomination.\n\n The material contamination is so strong that even a yogī fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified.\n\n \n\nTherefore the process of devotional service is always a success.\n\n No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n \n\nTherefore a person who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen.\n\n The words sādhur eva, “he is saintly, ” are very emphatic.\n\n They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down.\n\n And the word mantavyaḥ is still more emphatic.\n\n If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord.\n\n The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional serv.\n\n In the Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa the following statement is given: bhagavati ca harāv ananya-cetā bhṛśa-malino ’pi virājate manuṣyaḥ na hi śaśa-kaluṣa-cchabiḥ kadācit timira-parābhavatām upaiti candraḥ The meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon.\n\n Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight.\n\n Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable.\n\n On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections.\n\n Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy.\n\n As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns.\n\n But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained.\n\n No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee.\n\n If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.",

This question may justly be raised.\n\n The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam . Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart.\n\n He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away.\n\n Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature.\n\n According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself.\n\n But here there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage.\n\n This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns.\n\n He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.",

One should not try to understand Kṛṣṇa as a human being.\n\n As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being.\n\n This is again expressed here in a different way.\n\n A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.\n\n If Kṛṣṇa is known as the son of Devakī, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam : When He appeared before Devakī and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\n\n Anything done under the direction of Kṛṣṇa is transcendent.\n\n It cannot be contaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.\n\n The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world.\n\n Everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious.\n\n We simply imagine it to be auspicious.\n\n Real auspiciousness depends on activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in full devotion and serv.\n\n \n\nTherefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord.\n\n Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and Bhagavad-gītā , or from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord.\n\n The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way.\n\n There is no contradiction in these three sources.\n\n All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world.\n\n The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyāsa.\n\n As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā , one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities  \n***( anāśritaḥ karma-phalam )***\n, is a true renouncer.\n\n Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyāsī and a yogī, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyāsī, or a pseudo yogī.",

        "explanation": "In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the Māyāvādī philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.\n\n Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gītā in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n He at once boldly declares, “You are paraṁ brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n” And previously Kṛṣṇa stated that He is the originator of everything and everyone.\n\n Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him.\n\n Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional serv.\n\n This has already been explained in the previous verse by the Lord.\n\n \n\nNow, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction.\n\n It is not that because Kṛṣṇa is Arjuna’s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth.\n\n Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth.\n\n Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot.\n\n Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.\n\n In the Kena Upaniṣad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and Kṛṣṇa has already explained that everything is resting on Him.\n\n The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.\n\n This constant thinking of Kṛṣṇa is smaraṇam, one of the methods of devotional serv.\n\n It is only by devotional service to Kṛṣṇa that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.\n\n In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure.\n\n One who understands that Kṛṣṇa is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities.\n\n One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord.\n\n Arjuna’s acceptance of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature.\n\n This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Nārada is the chief.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him.\n\n He is the supreme existence.\n\n He is free from bodily needs, birth and death.\n\n Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Purāṇas and histories.\n\n In all Vedic literatures Kṛṣṇa is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.\n\n” He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him.\n\n This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.\n\n Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If we want to understand Bhagavad-gītā , we should accept the statements in these two verses.\n\n This is called the paramparā system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.\n\n Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gītā . It is not possible by so-called academic education.\n\n Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person.",

As described in the Fourth Chapter, the paramparā system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gītā was lost, and therefore Kṛṣṇa reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee.\n\n \n\nTherefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gītopaniṣad, Bhagavad-gītā should be understood in the paramparā system.\n\n When the paramparā system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it.\n\n The acceptance by Arjuna of all that Kṛṣṇa says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gītā , and then only can we understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

Bhagavad-gītā is the statement of Kṛṣṇa, and since it is the science of Kṛṣṇa, it should be understood from Kṛṣṇa as Arjuna understood it.\n\n It should not be received from atheistic persons.\n\n As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(..11)***\n : vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Paramātmā may not understand God’s personality.\n\n Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-gītā , which are being spoken by this person, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Sometimes the impersonalists accept Kṛṣṇa as Bhagavān, or they accept His authority.\n\n Yet many liberated persons cannot understand Kṛṣṇa as Puruṣottama, the Supreme Person.\n\n \n\nTherefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puruṣottama.\n\n Yet one still may not understand that Kṛṣṇa is the father of all living entities.\n\n \n\nTherefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bhūta-bhāvana.\n\n And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bhūteśa, the supreme controller of everyone.\n\n And even if one knows Kṛṣṇa as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods.\n\n And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagat-pati.\n\n \n\nThus the truth about Kṛṣṇa is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is.",

Kṛṣṇa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Nārāyaṇa and then to His own natural form of two hands.\n\n This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed Kṛṣṇa.\n\n He is the origin of all emanations.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception.\n\n As far as the four-handed forms of Kṛṣṇa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of Kṛṣṇa  \n***(which is known as Mahā-viṣṇu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering)***\n is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.\n\n As stated in the Brahma-saṁhitā  \n***(.48)***\n, yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vila-jā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi “The Mahā-viṣṇu, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nTherefore I worship Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, the cause of all causes.\n\n” \n\nTherefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge.\n\n He is the source of all forms of Viṣṇu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā . In the Vedic literature  \n***( Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad .1)***\n the following statement appears: sac-cid-ānanda-rūpāya kṛṣṇāyākliṣṭa-kāriṇe namo vedānta-vedyāya gurave buddhi-sākṣiṇe “I offer my respectful obeisances unto Kṛṣṇa, who has a transcendental form of bliss, eternity and knowledge.\n\n I offer my respect to Him, because understanding Him means understanding the Vedas, and He is therefore the supreme spiritual master.\n\n” Then it is said, kṛṣṇo vai paramaṁ daivatam: “Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n”  \n***( Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad .3)***\n Eko vaśī sarva-gaḥ kṛṣṇa īḍyaḥ: “That one Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is worshipable.\n\n” Eko ’pi san bahudhā yo ’vabhāti: “Kṛṣṇa is one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.\n\n”  \n***( Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad .21)***\n The Brahma-saṁhitā  \n***(.1)***\n says, īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam “The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa, who has a body of eternity, knowledge and bliss.\n\n He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of everything.\n\n He is the cause of all causes.\n\n” Elsewhere it is said, yatrāvatīrṇaṁ kṛṣṇākhyaṁ paraṁ brahma narākṛti: “The Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is Kṛṣṇa, and He sometimes descends on this earth.\n\n” Similarly, in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of Kṛṣṇa also appears.\n\n But then it is said that this Kṛṣṇa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself  \n***( ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam )***\n.\n\n Similarly, in Bhagavad-gītā the Lord says, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: “There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa.\n\n” He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gītā , aham ādir hi devānām: “I am the origin of all the demigods.\n\n” And after understanding Bhagavad-gītā from Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān, “I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\n\n” \n\nTherefore the universal form which Kṛṣṇa showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God.\n\n The original is the Kṛṣṇa form.\n\n The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God.\n\n It is not God’s original form.\n\n The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships.\n\n The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nTherefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with Kṛṣṇa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful.\n\n Arjuna, who was a constant companion of Kṛṣṇa’s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man.\n\n \n\nTherefore he was not captivated by the universal form.\n\n This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of Kṛṣṇa is the most dear.",

        "explanation": "Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the Kṛṣṇaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, Kṛṣṇa, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself.\n\n \n\nTherefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-gītā . The Bhagavad-gītā is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual l.\n\n The Bhagavad-gītā is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead.\n\n \n\nNow here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional serv.\n\n As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to Kṛṣṇa conscious activities.\n\n As stated in the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu  \n***(..255)***\n, anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate No work should be done by any man except in relationship to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This is called kṛṣṇa-karma.\n\n One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him.\n\n \n\nFor example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to do business for Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of the business, then Kṛṣṇa should enjoy the profit of the business.\n\n If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to Kṛṣṇa, he can do it.\n\n This is work for Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for Kṛṣṇa, and he can install the Deity of Kṛṣṇa and arrange for the Deity’s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional serv.\n\n This is all kṛṣṇa-karma.\n\n One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to Kṛṣṇa, and one should accept as prasādam the remnants of offerings to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If one constructs a very big building for Kṛṣṇa and installs the Deity of Kṛṣṇa, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is Kṛṣṇa.\n\n That is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for Kṛṣṇa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of Kṛṣṇa; that is also kṛṣṇa-karma.\n\n One can cultivate a garden.\n\n Anyone who has land – in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land – can utilize that for Kṛṣṇa by growing flowers to offer Him.\n\n One can sow tulasī plants, because tulasī leaves are very important and Kṛṣṇa has recommended this in Bhagavad-gītā . Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.\n\n Kṛṣṇa desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water – and by such an offering He is satisfied.\n\n This leaf especially refers to the tulasī.\n\n So one can sow tulasī and pour water on the plant.\n\n \n\nThus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for Kṛṣṇa.\n\n The word mat-paramaḥ refers to one who considers the association of Kṛṣṇa in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of l.\n\n Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka.\n\n He has no attraction for that.\n\n He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky.\n\n And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahma-jyotir effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana.\n\n He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other.\n\n As indicated by the word mad-bhaktaḥ, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him.\n\n One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\n\n The term saṅga-varjitaḥ is very significant.\n\n One should disassociate himself from persons who are against Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Not only are the atheistic persons against Kṛṣṇa, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.\n\n \n\nTherefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu  \n***(..11)***\n as follows: anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu- śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā In this verse Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination.\n\n He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.\n\n When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, that is called pure devotional serv.\n\n Ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ prātikūlyasya varjanam  \n***( Hari-bhakti-vilāsa 1.676)***\n.\n\n One should think of Kṛṣṇa and act for Kṛṣṇa favorably, not unfavorably.\n\n Kaṁsa was an enemy of Kṛṣṇa’s.\n\n From the very beginning of Kṛṣṇa’s birth, Kaṁsa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nThus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always Kṛṣṇa conscious in every respect, but that Kṛṣṇa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and Kṛṣṇa at last killed him.\n\n Of course anyone who is killed by Kṛṣṇa attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee.\n\n The pure devotee does not even want salvation.\n\n He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana.\n\n His only objective is to serve Kṛṣṇa wherever he may be.\n\n A devotee of Kṛṣṇa is friendly to everyone.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is said here that he has no enemy  \n***( nirvairaḥ )***\n.\n\n How is this? A devotee situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows that only devotional service to Kṛṣṇa can relieve a person from all the problems of l.\n\n He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, into human society.\n\n There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness.\n\n The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness.\n\n Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed.\n\n Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as Ṭhākura Haridāsa and Prahlāda Mahārāja.\n\n Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and it is difficult.\n\n A Kṛṣṇa conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all material problems.\n\n In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord.\n\n \n\nNow, we can imagine how merciful Kṛṣṇa is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.\n\n In summary, the universal form of Kṛṣṇa, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Viṣṇu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nThus Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all these manifestations.\n\n It is not that Kṛṣṇa is a manifestation of the original viśva-rūpa, or Viṣṇu.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all forms.\n\n There are hundreds and thousands of Viṣṇus, but for a devotee no form of Kṛṣṇa is important but the original form, two-handed Śyāmasundara.\n\n In the Brahma-saṁhitā it is stated that those who are attached to the Śyāmasundara form of Kṛṣṇa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else.\n\n One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Kṛṣṇa is essential and supreme.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Eleventh Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of the Universal Form.",

        "explanation": "Kṛṣṇa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogīs . Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes.\n\n One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist.\n\n The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord.\n\n The impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in the service of Kṛṣṇa but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.\n\n We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest.\n\n If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional serv.\n\n Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists.\n\n Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists.\n\n Arjuna is here questioning which position is better.\n\n There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but Kṛṣṇa indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is the highest of all.\n\n It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.\n\n In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā , the Supreme Lord explained that a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark.\n\n And the Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole.\n\n In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole.\n\n Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of Kṛṣṇa at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all yogīs, one who always thinks of Kṛṣṇa within himself is considered the most perfect.\n\n So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa, for that is the highest spiritual realization.\n\n Nevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to Bhagavad-gītā they want to distract other people from Kṛṣṇa and transfer all devotion to the impersonal brahma-jyotir . They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.\n\n And so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists.\n\n \n\nNow Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect.\n\n In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman.\n\n He wants to know whether his position is secure.\n\n The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation.\n\n Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth.\n\n \n\nTherefore Arjuna wants to say, “What is the use of such a waste of time?” Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Kṛṣṇa is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This important question asked of Kṛṣṇa by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.",

        "explanation": "The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jñāna-yogīs, and persons who are in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yogīs.\n\n \n\nNow, here the difference between jñāna-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed.\n\n The process of jñāna-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul.\n\n The individual soul is embodied since time immemori.\n\n It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the bhakti-yogī accepts the Deity of Kṛṣṇa as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied.\n\n Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worshi.\n\n There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguṇa or nirguṇa – of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.\n\n Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguṇa worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities.\n\n But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually materi.\n\n That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\n\n A crude example may be given here.\n\n We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty.\n\n But any old box, or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work.\n\n Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arcā-vigraha.\n\n This arcā-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord.\n\n God will accept service through that form.\n\n The Lord is omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arcā-vigraha He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned l.\n\n So for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult.\n\n They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upaniṣads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes.\n\n This is not very easy for a common man.\n\n A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily.\n\n There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end.\n\n But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly.\n\n A similar passage appears in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam . It is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead  \n***(this surrendering process is called bhakti )***\n, but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\n\n A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized.\n\n By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of jñāna-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional serv.\n\n At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea.\n\n \n\nTherefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization.\n\n Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual, blissful self.\n\n One should not take up this process.\n\n For every individual living entity the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way.\n\n If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism.\n\n \n\nThus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age.\n\n It is not advised by Lord Kṛṣṇa.",

But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause.\n\n In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct.\n\n Devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one’s activities.\n\n Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path.\n\n The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good.\n\n It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord.\n\n It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed.\n\n But as far as Bhagavad-gītā is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed.\n\n Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.",

        "explanation": "While discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter.\n\n In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul.\n\n Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says, “I am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body.\n\n I am the superknower.\n\n I am present in every body as the Paramātmā, or Supersoul.\n\n” One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gītā , can attain to knowledge.\n\n The Lord says, “I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.\n\n” The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies.\n\n The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies.\n\n He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of l.\n\n A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens.\n\n Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies.\n\n The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor.\n\n Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.\n\n The body consists of the senses.\n\n The Supreme Lord is Hṛṣīkeśa, which means “the controller of the senses.\n\n” He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers.\n\n The Lord says, “I am also the knower.\n\n” This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body.\n\n In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows: kṣetrāṇi hi śarīrāṇi bījaṁ cāpi śubhāśubhe tāni vetti sa yogātmā tataḥ kṣetra-jña ucyate This body is called the kṣetra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body.\n\n \n\nTherefore He is called the knower of all fields.\n\n The distinction between the field of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows.\n\n Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jñāna.\n\n That is the opinion of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge.\n\n One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge.\n\n One has to understand the position of prakṛti  \n***(nature)***\n, puruṣa  \n***(the enjoyer of nature)***\n and īśvara  \n***(the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul)***\n.\n\n One should not confuse the three in their different capacities.\n\n One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel.\n\n This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.\n\n It is stated in the Vedic language  \n***(in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad .12)***\n, bhoktā bhogyaṁ preritāraṁ ca matvā/ sarvaṁ proktaṁ tri-vidhaṁ brahmam etat.\n\n There are three Brahman conceptions: prakṛti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the jīva  \n***(individual soul)***\n is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.\n\n In this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible.\n\n One is superior and the other is subordinate.\n\n One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, “I am also the knower of the field of activity.\n\n” One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge.\n\n There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies.\n\n Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies.\n\n But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller.\n\n The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies.\n\n That is the opinion of Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul.\n\n And Kṛṣṇa explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer.",

One just has to understand this Bhagavad-gītā directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified.\n\n But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body to be one with the individual soul, the jīva.\n\n This is something like equating the potent and the impotent.",

        "explanation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge.\n\n Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Vedānta, which is accepted as authority.\n\n First He says, “This is according to different sages.\n\n” As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyāsadeva  \n***(the author of the Vedānta-sūtra )***\n is a great sage, and in the Vedānta-sūtra duality is perfectly explained.\n\n And Vyāsadeva’s father, Parāśara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, aham tvaṁ ca tathānye.\n\n… “we – you, I and the various other living entities – are all transcendental, although in material bodies.\n\n \n\nNow we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma.\n\n As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature.\n\n The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities.\n\n But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendent.\n\n” Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad.\n\n There are many great sages who have explained this, and Parāśara is considered principal among them.\n\n The word chandobhiḥ refers to the various Vedic literatures.\n\n The Taittirīya Upaniṣad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n As stated before, kṣetra is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of kṣetra-jña: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity.\n\n As stated in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad  \n***(.5)***\n, brahma pucchaṁ pratiṣṭhā.\n\n There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord’s energy known as anna-maya, dependence upon food for existence.\n\n This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme.\n\n Then, in prāṇa-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms.\n\n In jñāna-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing.\n\n Then there is Brahman realization, called vijñāna-maya, in which the living entity’s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself.\n\n The next and supreme stage is ānanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature.\n\n \n\nThus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham.\n\n Out of these, the first three – anna-maya, prāṇa-maya and jñāna-maya – involve the fields of activities of the living entities.\n\n Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called ānanda-maya.\n\n The Vedānta-sūtra also describes the Supreme by saying, ānanda-mayo ’bhyāsāt: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy.\n\n To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vijñāna-maya, prāṇa-maya, jñāna-maya and anna-maya.\n\n In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the ānanda-maya.\n\n That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the ānanda-maya, then he becomes perfect.\n\n This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.\n\n One has to search for this truth in the Vedānta-sūtra, or Brahma-sūtra.\n\n It is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-sūtra are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect.\n\n Some of the sūtras, or aphorisms, are na viyad aśruteḥ  \n***(..2)***\n, nātmā śruteḥ  \n***(..18)***\n, and parāt tu tac-chruteḥ  \n***(..40)***\n.\n\n The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the summum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities.",

        "explanation": "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity.\n\n But actually this is the real process of knowledge.\n\n If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists.\n\n This is not the interaction of the twenty-four elements, as described before.\n\n This is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements.\n\n The embodied soul is entrapped by the body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it.\n\n Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse.\n\n Mayi cānanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhicāriṇī: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord.\n\n So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value.\n\n But if one takes to devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him.\n\n As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(.1.12)***\n , yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.\n\n All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional serv.\n\n The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essenti.\n\n Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\n\n Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.\n\n Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.\n\n As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows.\n\n Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.\n\n The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge – who knows that he is not this body – anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless.\n\n One should not be hankering after this material deception.\n\n People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor.\n\n As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing.\n\n He can judge by these items.\n\n Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress.\n\n People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains.\n\n So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence.\n\n One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement.\n\n That is nonviolence.\n\n Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others.\n\n If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others.\n\n This is expected because material nature is so constituted.\n\n Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion.\n\n The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlāda tolerated him.\n\n So there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\n\n Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy.\n\n As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science.\n\n One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple.\n\n Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kṛṣṇa, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple’s following the regulative principles.\n\n Or, the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.\n\n Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and intern.\n\n External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kṛṣṇa always and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.\n\n Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual l.\n\n Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\n\n And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress.\n\n One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress.\n\n This is real renunciation.\n\n The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification.\n\n One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary.\n\n The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual l.\n\n The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue.\n\n If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses.\n\n The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate.\n\n \n\nTherefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.\n\n As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n That will control the eyes.\n\n Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gītā is simply expounding the science of devotional serv.\n\n Devotional service is the main and sole object.\n\n Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gītā try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gītā than devotional serv.\n\n False ego means accepting this body as oneself.\n\n When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego.\n\n Ego is there.\n\n False ego is condemned, but not real ego.\n\n In the Vedic literature  \n***( Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad ..10)***\n it is said, ahaṁ brahmāsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit.\n\n This “I am, ” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization.\n\n This sense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body it is false ego.\n\n When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\n\n There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, because ego means identity.\n\n We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.\n\n One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease.\n\n There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, ., are all very graphically described.\n\n It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful.\n\n Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death.\n\n Similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures.\n\n These should be discussed.\n\n And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience.\n\n No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\n\n Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these.\n\n They are natural objects of affection.\n\n But when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them.\n\n The best process for making the home pleasant is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n If one is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can make his home very happy, because this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy.\n\n One need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , and engage oneself in Deity worshi.\n\n These four things will make one happy.\n\n One should train the members of his family in this way.\n\n The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n If one can mold his family life in this way to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced l.\n\n But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\n\n One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kṛṣṇa, just as Arjuna did.\n\n Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his Kṛṣṇa realization, he accepted the instruction of Kṛṣṇa and fought and killed them.\n\n In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\n\n Happiness and distress are concomitant factors of material l.\n\n One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gītā . One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\n\n Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we are distressed.\n\n But if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us.\n\n To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional serv.\n\n Devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service – chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, . – as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.\n\n That process should be followed.\n\n Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men.\n\n That would go against his grain.\n\n One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without unwanted association.\n\n Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of t.\n\n There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gītā such research work and philosophical speculation have no value.\n\n That is more or less nonsensic.\n\n According to Bhagavad-gītā , one should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the soul.\n\n One should make research to understand the self.\n\n That is recommended here.\n\n As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practic.\n\n As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul.\n\n The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of l.\n\n This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated.\n\n So bhakti, or devotional service, is etern.\n\n One should be established in that philosophical conviction.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(..11)***\n this is explained.\n\n Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam.\n\n “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.\n\n” Bhagavān is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord.\n\n That is the perfection of knowledge.\n\n Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor.\n\n \n\nNow on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or the third floor, ., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of Kṛṣṇa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge.\n\n If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated.\n\n It is clearly stated that without humility, understanding is not truly possible.\n\n To think oneself God is most puffed u.\n\n Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance.\n\n The beginning of knowledge, therefore, is amānitva, humility.\n\n One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord.\n\n Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature.\n\n One must know and be convinced of this truth.",

        "explanation": "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity.\n\n But actually this is the real process of knowledge.\n\n If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists.\n\n This is not the interaction of the twenty-four elements, as described before.\n\n This is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements.\n\n The embodied soul is entrapped by the body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it.\n\n Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse.\n\n Mayi cānanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhicāriṇī: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord.\n\n So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value.\n\n But if one takes to devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him.\n\n As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(.1.12)***\n , yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.\n\n All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional serv.\n\n The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essenti.\n\n Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\n\n Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.\n\n Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.\n\n As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows.\n\n Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.\n\n The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge – who knows that he is not this body – anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless.\n\n One should not be hankering after this material deception.\n\n People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor.\n\n As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing.\n\n He can judge by these items.\n\n Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress.\n\n People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains.\n\n So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence.\n\n One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement.\n\n That is nonviolence.\n\n Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others.\n\n If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others.\n\n This is expected because material nature is so constituted.\n\n Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion.\n\n The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlāda tolerated him.\n\n So there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\n\n Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy.\n\n As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science.\n\n One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple.\n\n Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kṛṣṇa, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple’s following the regulative principles.\n\n Or, the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.\n\n Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and intern.\n\n External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kṛṣṇa always and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.\n\n Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual l.\n\n Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\n\n And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress.\n\n One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress.\n\n This is real renunciation.\n\n The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification.\n\n One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary.\n\n The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual l.\n\n The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue.\n\n If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses.\n\n The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate.\n\n \n\nTherefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.\n\n As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n That will control the eyes.\n\n Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gītā is simply expounding the science of devotional serv.\n\n Devotional service is the main and sole object.\n\n Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gītā try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gītā than devotional serv.\n\n False ego means accepting this body as oneself.\n\n When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego.\n\n Ego is there.\n\n False ego is condemned, but not real ego.\n\n In the Vedic literature  \n***( Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad ..10)***\n it is said, ahaṁ brahmāsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit.\n\n This “I am, ” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization.\n\n This sense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body it is false ego.\n\n When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\n\n There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, because ego means identity.\n\n We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.\n\n One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease.\n\n There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, ., are all very graphically described.\n\n It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful.\n\n Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death.\n\n Similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures.\n\n These should be discussed.\n\n And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience.\n\n No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\n\n Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these.\n\n They are natural objects of affection.\n\n But when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them.\n\n The best process for making the home pleasant is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n If one is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can make his home very happy, because this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy.\n\n One need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , and engage oneself in Deity worshi.\n\n These four things will make one happy.\n\n One should train the members of his family in this way.\n\n The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n If one can mold his family life in this way to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following these

One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\n\n Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we are distressed.\n\n But if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us.\n\n To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional serv.\n\n Devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service – chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, . – as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.\n\n That process should be followed.\n\n Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men.\n\n That would go against his grain.\n\n One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without unwanted association.\n\n Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of t.\n\n There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gītā such research work and philosophical speculation have no value.\n\n That is more or less nonsensic.\n\n According to Bhagavad-gītā , one should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the soul.\n\n One should make research to understand the self.\n\n That is recommended here.\n\n As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practic.\n\n As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul.\n\n The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of l.\n\n This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated.\n\n So bhakti, or devotional service, is etern.\n\n One should be established in that philosophical conviction.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(..11)***\n this is explained.\n\n Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam.\n\n “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.\n\n” Bhagavān is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord.\n\n That is the perfection of knowledge.\n\n Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor.\n\n \n\nNow on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or the third floor, ., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of Kṛṣṇa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge.\n\n If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated.\n\n It is clearly stated that without humility, understanding is not truly possible.\n\n To think oneself God is most puffed u.\n\n Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance.\n\n The beginning of knowledge, therefore, is amānitva, humility.\n\n One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord.\n\n Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature.\n\n One must know and be convinced of this truth.",

        "explanation": "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity.\n\n But actually this is the real process of knowledge.\n\n If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists.\n\n This is not the interaction of the twenty-four elements, as described before.\n\n This is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements.\n\n The embodied soul is entrapped by the body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it.\n\n Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse.\n\n Mayi cānanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhicāriṇī: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord.\n\n So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value.\n\n But if one takes to devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him.\n\n As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(.1.12)***\n , yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.\n\n All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional serv.\n\n The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essenti.\n\n Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.\n\n Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.\n\n Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.\n\n As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows.\n\n Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.\n\n The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge – who knows that he is not this body – anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless.\n\n One should not be hankering after this material deception.\n\n People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor.\n\n As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing.\n\n He can judge by these items.\n\n Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress.\n\n People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains.\n\n So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence.\n\n One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement.\n\n That is nonviolence.\n\n Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others.\n\n If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others.\n\n This is expected because material nature is so constituted.\n\n Even a boy like Prahlāda, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion.\n\n The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlāda tolerated him.\n\n So there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\n\n Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy.\n\n As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science.\n\n One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple.\n\n Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Kṛṣṇa, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple’s following the regulative principles.\n\n Or, the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.\n\n Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and intern.\n\n External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of Kṛṣṇa always and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.\n\n Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual l.\n\n Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.\n\n And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress.\n\n One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress.\n\n This is real renunciation.\n\n The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification.\n\n One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary.\n\n The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual l.\n\n The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue.\n\n If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses.\n\n The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate.\n\n \n\nTherefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.\n\n As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n That will control the eyes.\n\n Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gītā is simply expounding the science of devotional serv.\n\n Devotional service is the main and sole object.\n\n Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-gītā try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gītā than devotional serv.\n\n False ego means accepting this body as oneself.\n\n When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego.\n\n Ego is there.\n\n False ego is condemned, but not real ego.\n\n In the Vedic literature  \n***( Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad ..10)***\n it is said, ahaṁ brahmāsmi: I am Brahman, I am spirit.\n\n This “I am, ” the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization.\n\n This sense of “I am” is ego, but when the sense of “I am” is applied to this false body it is false ego.\n\n When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.\n\n There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, because ego means identity.\n\n We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.\n\n One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease.\n\n There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam the world of the unborn, the child’s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, ., are all very graphically described.\n\n It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful.\n\n Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death.\n\n Similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures.\n\n These should be discussed.\n\n And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience.\n\n No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.\n\n Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these.\n\n They are natural objects of affection.\n\n But when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them.\n\n The best process for making the home pleasant is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n If one is in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can make his home very happy, because this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy.\n\n One need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , and engage oneself in Deity worshi.\n\n These four things will make one happy.\n\n One should train the members of his family in this way.\n\n The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n If one can mold his family life in this way to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced l.\n\n But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.\n\n One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Kṛṣṇa, just as Arjuna did.\n\n Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his Kṛṣṇa realization, he accepted the instruction of Kṛṣṇa and fought and killed them.\n\n In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\n\n Happiness and distress are concomitant factors of material l.\n\n One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gītā . One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases.\n\n Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we are distressed.\n\n But if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us.\n\n To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional serv.\n\n Devotional service to Kṛṣṇa without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service – chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, . – as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.\n\n That process should be followed.\n\n Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men.\n\n That would go against his grain.\n\n One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without unwanted association.\n\n Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of t.\n\n There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gītā such research work and philosophical speculation have no value.\n\n That is more or less nonsensic.\n\n According to Bhagavad-gītā , one should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the soul.\n\n One should make research to understand the self.\n\n That is recommended here.\n\n As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practic.\n\n As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul.\n\n The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of l.\n\n This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated.\n\n So bhakti, or devotional service, is etern.\n\n One should be established in that philosophical conviction.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  \n***(..11)***\n this is explained.\n\n Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam.\n\n “Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.\n\n” Bhagavān is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord.\n\n That is the perfection of knowledge.\n\n Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor.\n\n \n\nNow on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or the third floor, ., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of Kṛṣṇa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge.\n\n If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated.\n\n It is clearly stated that without humility, understanding is not truly possible.\n\n To think oneself God is most puffed u.\n\n Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, he still thinks, “I am God” because of ignorance.\n\n The beginning of knowledge, therefore, is amānitva, humility.\n\n One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord.\n\n Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature.\n\n One must know and be convinced of this truth.",

        "explanation": "This verse is a reply to Arjuna’s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature.\n\n One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Kṛṣṇa activities.\n\n Kṛṣṇa activities are known as bhakti-yoga – always acting for Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This includes not only Kṛṣṇa, but His different plenary expansions such as Rāma and Nārāyaṇa.\n\n He has innumerable expansions.\n\n One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of Kṛṣṇa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated.\n\n One should also note that all the forms of Kṛṣṇa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and etern.\n\n Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities.\n\n So if one engages himself in the service of Kṛṣṇa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome them easily.\n\n This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter.\n\n One who surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature.\n\n To be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality with Kṛṣṇa.\n\n The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold m.\n\n \n\nThus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kṛṣṇa in quality.\n\n The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of bhakti-yoga.\n\n Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there, and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there.\n\n \n\nTherefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning to bhakti-yoga . If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord.\n\n To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications.\n\n \n\nThus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination.\n\n It is said in the Vedic literature, brahmaiva san brahmāpy eti . One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman.\n\n This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman.\n\n By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as an individual soul.",

        "explanation": "The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity and happiness.\n\n Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.\n\n Paramātmā, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth.\n\n \n\nTherefore, both Paramātmā and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person.\n\n It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord.\n\n The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature.\n\n When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme.\n\n This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization.\n\n At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.\n\n If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Paramātmā realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n There are many examples of this in Vedic literature.\n\n The four Kumāras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional serv.\n\n One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down.\n\n In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear.\n\n \n\nTherefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.\n\n In the Vedic language it is also said, raso vai saḥ, rasaṁ hy evāyaṁ labdhvānandī bhavati: “When one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure, Kṛṣṇa, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.\n\n”  \n***( Taittirīya Upaniṣad ..1)***\n The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of these six opulences.\n\n The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king.\n\n And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional serv.\n\n \n\nTherefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional serv.\n\n This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional serv.\n\n The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down.\n\n In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature – goodness, passion and ignorance.\n\n Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there.\n\n By engagement in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed.\n\n \n\nTherefore the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering – the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service – should be practiced in the association of devotees.\n\n Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one’s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord’s transcendental loving serv.\n\n This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter.\n\n Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees.\n\n By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities.\n\n One who can thus situate himself in the brahma-jyotir or the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Fourteenth Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.",

        "explanation": "After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, “What about the Vedas ?” It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nTherefore one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.\n\n The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree.\n\n For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree.\n\n He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another.\n\n The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation.\n\n The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree.\n\n This tree’s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahmā is located, the topmost planet of this universe.\n\n If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.\n\n This process of extrication should be understood.\n\n In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement.\n\n And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way.\n\n \n\nNow, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord.\n\n The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter.\n\n The root of this material existence grows upward.\n\n This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe.\n\n From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems.\n\n The fruits represent the results of the living entities’ activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.\n\n \n\nNow, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing.\n\n That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water.\n\n We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots u.\n\n In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world.\n\n This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree’s reflection is situated on water.\n\n Desire is the cause of things’ being situated in this reflected material light.\n\n One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study.\n\n Then he can cut off his relationship with it.\n\n This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.\n\n Everything is there in the spiritual world.\n\n The impersonalists take Brahman to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to Sāṅkhya philosophy, come prakṛti, puruṣa, then the three guṇas, then the five gross elements  \n***( pañca-mahā-bhūta )***\n, then the ten senses  \n***( daśendriya )***\n, mind, . In this way they divide up the whole material world into twenty-four elements.\n\n If Brahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world.\n\n The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality.\n\n The prakṛti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puruṣa is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-gītā . Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary.\n\n A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen.\n\n But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is etern.\n\n The material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off.\n\n When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world.\n\n If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas.\n\n One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree.\n\n He does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas.\n\n The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.",

        "explanation": "In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given.\n\n The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord – eternally.\n\n It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord.\n\n He is eternally fragmented.\n\n It is clearly said, sanātanaḥ.\n\n According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called viṣṇu-tattva and the secondary expansions are called the living entities.\n\n In other words, the viṣṇu-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions.\n\n By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord Rāma, Nṛsiṁha-deva, Viṣṇumūrti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaikuṇṭha planets.\n\n The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors.\n\n The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present.\n\n Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities.\n\n As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one.\n\n Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence.\n\n By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated.\n\n In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is.\n\n In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord.\n\n As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.\n\n The living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world – Brahmā, Lord Śiva and even Viṣṇu – are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord.\n\n They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations.\n\n The word karṣati  \n***(“struggling” or “grappling hard”)***\n is very significant.\n\n The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains.\n\n He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence.\n\n When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of l.\n\n It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity.\n\n The following information is there in the Mādhyandināyana-śruti: sa vā eṣa brahma-niṣṭha idaṁ śarīraṁ martyam atisṛjya brahmābhisampadya brahmaṇā paśyati brahmaṇā śṛṇoti brahmaṇaivedaṁ sarvam anubhavati.\n\n It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.\n\n He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is.\n\n From smṛti also it is understood, vasanti yatra puruṣāḥ sarve vaikuṇṭha-mūrtayaḥ: in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s.\n\n As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the expansions of viṣṇu-mūrti.\n\n In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n The words mamaivāṁśaḥ  \n***(“fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord”)***\n are also very significant.\n\n The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part.\n\n We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces.\n\n This fragment is not materially conceived.\n\n It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and joined together again.\n\n That conception is not applicable here, because the Sanskrit word sanātana  \n***(“eternal”)***\n is used.\n\n The fragmental portion is etern.\n\n It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present  \n***( dehino ’smin yathā dehe )***\n.\n\n That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord.\n\n It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.",

        "explanation": "The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures.\n\n And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n \n\nThus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge.\n\n In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature.\n\n Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding.\n\n Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist.\n\n Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the Supreme Lord.\n\n The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness.\n\n Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness.\n\n \n\nTherefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.\n\n Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kṛṣṇa and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified.\n\n Unless one comes to this position of understanding Kṛṣṇa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.\n\n The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant.\n\n Anagha, “O sinless one, ” means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa.\n\n One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand.\n\n But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.\n\n While one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether.\n\n The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart.\n\n The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature.\n\n \n\nThus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.\n\n The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter.\n\n The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart.\n\n In this chapter the first five verses describe the process of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the chapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses puruṣottama-yoga.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Fifteenth Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of Puruṣottama-yoga, the Yoga of the Supreme Person.",

        "explanation": "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained.\n\n The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious.\n\n In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained.\n\n \n\nNow, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as daivī prakṛti, transcendental by nature.\n\n Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation.\n\n For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation.\n\n Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms.\n\n In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities.\n\n He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.\n\n The word abhijātasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant.\n\n To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.\n\n If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being.\n\n In Bhagavad-gītā we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kṛṣṇa Himself.\n\n Sex life is not condemned, provided the process is used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become Kṛṣṇa conscious after birth.\n\n That should be the advantage of children born of a father and mother absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n The social institution known as varṇāśrama-dharma – the institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castes – is not meant to divide human society according to birth.\n\n Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.\n\n They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity.\n\n The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world.\n\n In the varṇāśrama institution the sannyāsī, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders.\n\n A brāhmaṇa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the kṣatriyas, the vaiśyas and the śūdras, but a sannyāsī, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brāhmaṇas also.\n\n For a sannyāsī, the first qualification should be fearlessness.\n\n Because a sannyāsī has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n If one thinks, “After I leave my connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order of l.\n\n One must be fully convinced that Kṛṣṇa or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramātmā is always within, that He is seeing everything, and He always knows what one intends to do.\n\n One must thus have firm conviction that Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.\n\n “I shall never be alone, ” one should think.\n\n “Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, and He will give me all protection.\n\n” That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness.\n\n This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of l.\n\n Then he has to purify his existence.\n\n There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of l.\n\n Most important of all, a sannyāsī is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman.\n\n He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place.\n\n Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyāsī, and when He was at Purī His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects.\n\n They were advised to bow down from a distant place.\n\n This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyāsī not to have close connections with women.\n\n One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence.\n\n For a sannyāsī, intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden.\n\n The ideal sannyāsī was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women.\n\n Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyāsa order of life in connection with association with women.\n\n One of His personal associates, namely Choṭa Haridāsa, was associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Choṭa Haridāsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates.\n\n Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyāsī or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification – not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity – is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\n\n” So these are the processes for purification.\n\n The next item is jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge.\n\n Sannyāsī life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement.\n\n A sannyāsī is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar.\n\n Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyāsī goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n This is the duty of a sannyāsī.\n\n If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness with logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of l.\n\n But even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge.\n\n A sannyāsī, or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saṁśuddhi  \n***(purity)***\n and jñāna-yoga  \n***(knowledge)***\n.\n\n The next item is charity.\n\n Charity is meant for the householders.\n\n The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.\n\n \n\nThus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way.\n\n Charity should be given to the right receiver.\n\n There are different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on – charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance.\n\n Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money.\n\n Charity should be given only to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.\n\n That is charity in the mode of goodness.\n\n Then as far as dama  \n***(self-control)***\n is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.\n\n Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily.\n\n There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children.\n\n If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his w.\n\n Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children.\n\n This is not in the transcendental quality, but is demoniac.\n\n If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If he is able to beget children who will be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\n\n Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacrifices require a large amount of money.\n\n Those in other orders of life, namely brahmacarya, vānaprastha and sannyāsa, have no money; they live by begging.\n\n So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householders.\n\n They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them.\n\n The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called saṅkīrtana-yajña.\n\n This saṅkīrtana-yajña, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit.\n\n So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\n\n Then svādhyāya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student l.\n\n Brahmacārīs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge.\n\n This is called svādhyāya.\n\n Tapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired l.\n\n One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life – brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa.\n\n So after gṛhastha, householder life, one should ret.\n\n If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of l.\n\n These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipl.\n\n A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue.\n\n That is tapasya.\n\n The entire varṇāśrama-dharma society is meant for tapasya.\n\n Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get liberation.\n\n The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gītā . Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers.\n\n If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted.\n\n \n\nTherefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives.\n\n But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\n\n As far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacārī āśrama, gṛhastha āśrama, vānaprastha āśrama or sannyāsa āśrama.\n\n One should be very simple and straightforward.\n\n Ahiṁsā means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity.\n\n One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.\n\n People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk.\n\n There is no necessity for animal killing.\n\n This injunction is for everyone.\n\n When there is no alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrif.\n\n At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.\n\n Real ahiṁsā means not checking anyone’s progressive l.\n\n The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another.\n\n If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked.\n\n If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of l.\n\n So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s palate.\n\n This is called ahiṁsā.\n\n Satyam.\n\n This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest.\n\n In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n That is the process for understanding the Vedas.\n\n Śruti means that one should hear from the authority.\n\n One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest.\n\n There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gītā that misinterpret the original text.\n\n The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n Akrodha means to check anger.\n\n Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted.\n\n Anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger.\n\n Apaiśunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily.\n\n Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n Hrī means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.\n\n Acāpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt.\n\n There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination.\n\n The word tejas used here is meant for the kṣatriyas.\n\n The kṣatriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak.\n\n They should not pose themselves as nonviolent.\n\n If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\n\n But a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions show forgiveness.\n\n He may excuse minor offenses.\n\n Śaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings also.\n\n It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market.\n\n Nāti-mānitā, not expecting honor, applies to the śūdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes.\n\n They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status.\n\n It is the duty of the śūdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\n\n All these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.\n\n They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and occupational order.\n\n The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.",

        "explanation": "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained.\n\n The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious.\n\n In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained.\n\n \n\nNow, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as daivī prakṛti, transcendental by nature.\n\n Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation.\n\n For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation.\n\n Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms.\n\n In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities.\n\n He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.\n\n The word abhijātasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant.\n\n To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.\n\n If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being.\n\n In Bhagavad-gītā we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kṛṣṇa Himself.\n\n Sex life is not condemned, provided the process is used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become Kṛṣṇa conscious after birth.\n\n That should be the advantage of children born of a father and mother absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n The social institution known as varṇāśrama-dharma – the institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castes – is not meant to divide human society according to birth.\n\n Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.\n\n They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity.\n\n The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world.\n\n In the varṇāśrama institution the sannyāsī, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders.\n\n A brāhmaṇa is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the kṣatriyas, the vaiśyas and the śūdras, but a sannyāsī, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brāhmaṇas also.\n\n For a sannyāsī, the first qualification should be fearlessness.\n\n Because a sannyāsī has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n If one thinks, “After I leave my connections, who will protect me?” he should not accept the renounced order of l.\n\n One must be fully convinced that Kṛṣṇa or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramātmā is always within, that He is seeing everything, and He always knows what one intends to do.\n\n One must thus have firm conviction that Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.\n\n “I shall never be alone, ” one should think.\n\n “Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, and He will give me all protection.\n\n” That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness.\n\n This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of l.\n\n Then he has to purify his existence.\n\n There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of l.\n\n Most important of all, a sannyāsī is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman.\n\n He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place.\n\n Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyāsī, and when He was at Purī His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects.\n\n They were advised to bow down from a distant place.\n\n This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyāsī not to have close connections with women.\n\n One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence.\n\n For a sannyāsī, intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden.\n\n The ideal sannyāsī was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women.\n\n Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyāsa order of life in connection with association with women.\n\n One of His personal associates, namely Choṭa Haridāsa, was associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Choṭa Haridāsa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates.\n\n Lord Caitanya said, “For a sannyāsī or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification – not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity – is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\n\n” So these are the processes for purification.\n\n The next item is jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge.\n\n Sannyāsī life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement.\n\n A sannyāsī is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar.\n\n Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyāsī goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n This is the duty of a sannyāsī.\n\n If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness with logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of l.\n\n But even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge.\n\n A sannyāsī, or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-saṁśuddhi  \n***(purity)***\n and jñāna-yoga  \n***(knowledge)***\n.\n\n The next item is charity.\n\n Charity is meant for the householders.\n\n The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.\n\n \n\nThus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way.\n\n Charity should be given to the right receiver.\n\n There are different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on – charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance.\n\n Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money.\n\n Charity should be given only to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.\n\n That is charity in the mode of goodness.\n\n Then as far as dama  \n***(self-control)***\n is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder.\n\n Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily.\n\n There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children.\n\n If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his w.\n\n Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children.\n\n This is not in the transcendental quality, but is demoniac.\n\n If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If he is able to beget children who will be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\n\n Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacrifices require a large amount of money.\n\n Those in other orders of life, namely brahmacarya, vānaprastha and sannyāsa, have no money; they live by begging.\n\n So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householders.\n\n They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them.\n\n The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called saṅkīrtana-yajña.\n\n This saṅkīrtana-yajña, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit.\n\n So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\n\n Then svādhyāya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student l.\n\n Brahmacārīs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge.\n\n This is called svādhyāya.\n\n Tapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired l.\n\n One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life – brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha and sannyāsa.\n\n So after gṛhastha, householder life, one should ret.\n\n If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of l.\n\n These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipl.\n\n A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue.\n\n That is tapasya.\n\n The entire varṇāśrama-dharma society is meant for tapasya.\n\n Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get liberation.\n\n The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gītā . Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers.\n\n If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted.\n\n \n\nTherefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don’t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives.\n\n But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\n\n As far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacārī āśrama, gṛhastha āśrama, vānaprastha āśrama or sannyāsa āśrama.\n\n One should be very simple and straightforward.\n\n Ahiṁsā means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity.\n\n One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.\n\n People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk.\n\n There is no necessity for animal killing.\n\n This injunction is for everyone.\n\n When there is no alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrif.\n\n At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.\n\n Real ahiṁsā means not checking anyone’s progressive l.\n\n The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another.\n\n If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked.\n\n If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of l.\n\n So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one’s palate.\n\n This is called ahiṁsā.\n\n Satyam.\n\n This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest.\n\n In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n That is the process for understanding the Vedas.\n\n Śruti means that one should hear from the authority.\n\n One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest.\n\n There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gītā that misinterpret the original text.\n\n The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\n\n Akrodha means to check anger.\n\n Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted.\n\n Anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger.\n\n Apaiśunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily.\n\n Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual l.\n\n Hrī means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.\n\n Acāpalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt.\n\n There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination.\n\n The word tejas used here is meant for the kṣatriyas.\n\n The kṣatriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak.\n\n They should not pose themselves as nonviolent.\n\n If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\n\n But a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions show forgiveness.\n\n He may excuse minor offenses.\n\n Śaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one’s dealings also.\n\n It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market.\n\n Nāti-mānitā, not expecting honor, applies to the śūdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes.\n\n They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status.\n\n It is the duty of the śūdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\n\n All these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.\n\n They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and occupational order.\n\n The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.",

As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.\n\n The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.\n\n As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-saṁhitā, which is the law of the human race.\n\n Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-saṁhitā.\n\n Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book.\n\n \n\nNow, in the Manu-saṁhitā it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom.\n\n That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children.\n\n Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves.\n\n The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men.\n\n \n\nHowever, this has not improved the social condition of the world.\n\n Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of l.\n\n She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age.\n\n This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-saṁhitā.\n\n But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society.\n\n The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom.\n\n The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.",

One should act accordingly, without argument.\n\n That is called following the principles of śāstra, or scripture.\n\n Śāstra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned.\n\n These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the rules and regulations as described in the śāstra – being above these defects – are accepted without alteration by all great saints, ācāryas and great souls.\n\n In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist.\n\n Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas . Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage.\n\n One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the śāstras is considered fortunate.\n\n In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns.\n\n That is the greatest offense of human l.\n\n \n\nTherefore, māyā, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries.\n\n This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature.\n\n One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened.\n\n Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac l.\n\n Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures.\n\n In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted.\n\n \n\nThus they manufacture their own way of elevation.\n\n These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of l.\n\n If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one’s life becomes successful.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Sixteenth Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures.",

Viśate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in one’s individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him.\n\n For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree.\n\n Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging.\n\n This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean.\n\n We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go dee.\n\n Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.\n\n Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth.\n\n As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand.\n\n The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.\n\n After attainment of the brahma-bhūta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord.\n\n When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhūta stage develops, and material contamination – greediness and lust for sense enjoyment – disappears.\n\n As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination.\n\n In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord.\n\n This is the statement of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also.\n\n After liberation the process of bhakti, or transcendental service, continues.\n\n The Vedānta-sūtra  \n***(..12)***\n confirms this: ā-prāyaṇāt tatrāpi hi dṛṣṭam.\n\n This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues.\n\n In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position.\n\n The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord.\n\n \n\nTherefore his constitutional position is to serve.\n\n After liberation, this service is never stopped.\n\n Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of l.",

That he does not consider.\n\n So that is the last snare of illusion.\n\n Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.\n\n The word moha is very important in this verse.\n\n Moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge.\n\n Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature.\n\n That is his illusion.\n\n This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee.\n\n When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\n\n Kṛṣṇa consciousness is acting according to Kṛṣṇa’s order.\n\n A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything.\n\n Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee.\n\n He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities.\n\n He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies.\n\n The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee.\n\n One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of māyā.\n\n Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-gītā from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion.\n\n He could understand that Kṛṣṇa was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n And he understood Kṛṣṇa factually.\n\n So to study Bhagavad-gītā is to understand Kṛṣṇa factually.\n\n When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to Kṛṣṇa.\n\n When Arjuna understood that it was Kṛṣṇa’s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to Kṛṣṇa’s des.\n\n He again took up his weapons – his arrows and bow – to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.",

        "explanation": "In the beginning of Bhagavad-gītā , Dhṛtarāṣṭra inquired from his secretary Sañjaya, “What happened on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra?” The entire study was related to the heart of Sañjaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vyāsa.\n\n He thus explained the theme of the battlefield.\n\n The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls had never taken place before and would not take place again.\n\n It was wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord.\n\n If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Kṛṣṇa, then our life will be happy and successful.\n\n Sañjaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dhṛtarāṣṭra.\n\n \n\nNow it is concluded that wherever there is Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, there is victory.",

        "explanation": "Vyāsa was the spiritual master of Sañjaya, and Sañjaya admits that it was by Vyāsa’s mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n This means that one has to understand Kṛṣṇa not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master.\n\n The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is still direct.\n\n This is the mystery of the disciplic succession.\n\n When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-gītā directly, as Arjuna heard it.\n\n There are many mystics and yogīs all over the world, but Kṛṣṇa is the master of all yoga systems.\n\n Kṛṣṇa’s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gītā – surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.\n\n One who does so is the topmost yogī.\n\n This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.\n\n Yoginām api sarveṣām.\n\n Nārada is the direct disciple of Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master of Vyāsa.\n\n \n\nTherefore Vyāsa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sañjaya is the direct disciple of Vyāsa.\n\n \n\nTherefore by the grace of Vyāsa, Sañjaya’s senses were purified, and he could see and hear Kṛṣṇa directly.\n\n One who directly hears Kṛṣṇa can understand this confidential knowledge.\n\n If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear Kṛṣṇa; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-gītā is concerned.\n\n In Bhagavad-gītā , all the yoga systems – karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga and bhakti-yoga – are explained.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is the master of all such mysticism.\n\n It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand Kṛṣṇa directly, so, by the grace of Vyāsa, Sañjaya was also able to hear Kṛṣṇa directly.\n\n Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from Kṛṣṇa and hearing directly from Kṛṣṇa via a bona fide spiritual master like Vyāsa.\n\n The spiritual master is the representative of Vyāsadeva also.\n\n \n\nTherefore, according to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vyāsa-pūjā.",

        "explanation": "The Bhagavad-gītā began with an inquiry of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s.\n\n He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhīṣma, Droṇa and Karṇa.\n\n He was hopeful that the victory would be on his s.\n\n But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sañjaya told the King, “You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.\n\n” He directly confirmed that Dhṛtarāṣṭra could not expect victory for his s.\n\n Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Kṛṣṇa was there.\n\n Kṛṣṇa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them.\n\n There are many instances of such renunciation, for Kṛṣṇa is also the master of renunciation.\n\n The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira.\n\n Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiṣṭhira.\n\n Because Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhiṣṭhira, Yudhiṣṭhira’s victory was certain.\n\n The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhiṣṭhira.\n\n It is also predicted here that Yudhiṣṭhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist.\n\n He never spoke a lie during his l.\n\n There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gītā to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield.\n\n But such a book cannot be scripture.\n\n Some may protest that Kṛṣṇa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-gītā is the supreme instruction in morality.\n\n The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.\n\n One must become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa  \n***( sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja )***\n.\n\n The instructions of Bhagavad-gītā constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality.\n\n All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the Gītā is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.\n\n This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\n From Bhagavad-gītā we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kṛṣṇa is the highest perfection.\n\n This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gītā . The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge.\n\n But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidenti.\n\n And surrender unto Kṛṣṇa in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the most confidential instruction.\n\n That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\n\n Another feature of Bhagavad-gītā is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n The Absolute Truth is realized in three features – impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n If one understands Kṛṣṇa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding.\n\n Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency.\n\n The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated.\n\n Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions.\n\n The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.\n\n This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\n\n In Bhagavad-gītā five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities.\n\n All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.\n\n All conceptions of the Absolute Truth – impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and any other transcendental conception – exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n\n Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme.\n\n But the Supreme is always different from everything.\n\n Lord Caitanya’s philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness and difference.\n\n” This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\n\n The living entity in his original position is pure spirit.\n\n He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit.\n\n \n\nThus Lord Kṛṣṇa may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunsh.\n\n Because the living entities are the marginal energy of Kṛṣṇa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy.\n\n In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence.\n\n By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kṛṣṇa.\n\n \n\nThus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\n\n \n\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta s to the Eighteenth Chapter of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā in the matter of its Conclusion – the Perfection of Renunciation.",
