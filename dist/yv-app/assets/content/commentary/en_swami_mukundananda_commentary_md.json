        "explanation": "The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable.\n\n Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu’s sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question? The blind King Dhritarashtra’s fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue.\n\n He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu.\n\n Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.\n\n The words dharma kṣhetre , the land of dharma  \n***(virtuous conduct)***\n used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing.\n\n  Kurukshetra is described as kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals.\n\n It means “Kurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.”\n\n Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma.\n\n  Dhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons.\n\n If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce.\n\n A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them.\n\n He felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires.\n\n He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons.\n\n \n\nTherefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.",

the Kauravas or to be defeated by them.\n\n Both alternatives seemed like defeat, for if he did win the war by slaying the Kauravas, he would have no further desire to l.\n\n \n\nHowever, the fact was that Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, . had acted ignobly by taking the side of the unrighteous Kauravas.\n\n The word arthakām has been used for them, implying, “attached to wealth and position, ” they had taken the side of the wicked Duryodhan.\n\n So, killing them in the war was a natural consequence.\n\n In fact, after the war, Bheeshma himself admitted that a teacher who acts ignobly is fit to be abandoned.\n\n Here, special mention needs to be made of Bheeshma.\n\n According to the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam  \n***(verse .2.19)***\n, he was a great devotee of Shree Krishna.\n\n He was a master of his senses, and an icon of chivalry and generosity.\n\n He was a knower of the Absolute Truth, and had vowed to always speak the truth in his l.\n\n Even death could only come to him when he chose to accept it.\n\n For various reasons, he is enumerated amongst the twelve great personalities, or Mahājans , mentioned in the Bhāgavatam: swayambhūr nāradaḥ śhambhuḥ kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ prahlādo janako bhīṣhmo balir vaiyāsakir vayam  \n***(..20)***\n [v1] “These are the twelve great knowers of religious principles—the first-born Brahma, Sage Narad, Lord Shiv, the four Kumars, Bhagavan Kapil  \n***(son of Devahuti)***\n, Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlad Maharaj, Janak Maharaj, Grandfather Bheeshma, Bali Maharaj, Shukadev Muni, and Ved Vyas.”\n\n Hence, Bheeshma was an enlightened soul, whose actions could never be against the principles of dharma.\n\n \n\nHowever, his profound character was beyond mundane reasoning.\n\n Even though he fought on the side of the Kauravas, he said to Yudhishthir  \n***(the eldest of the Pandava brothers)***\n before the war, “I am obliged to combat on the side of unrighteousness, but I give you the boon that you will be victorious.”\n\n Bheeshma knew that the righteous Pandavas, who had the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna on their side, could never lose.\n\n By taking the side of adharma  \n***(unrighteousness)***\n, he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war.\n\n He thus offered the biggest sacrifice of laying down his life, to assist the divine pastimes of Lord Krishna.\n\n Shree Krishna was well aware of Bheeshma’s deep devotion toward him, despite his fighting from the side of the Kauravas.\n\n That is why he upheld Bheeshma’s vow by breaking his own.\n\n Bheeshma resolved on a particular day during the war, that before sunset on the next day, he would either kill Arjun, the foremost Pandava warrior, or else to save him, Shree Krishna would have to break his own vow of not lifting weapons in the battle of Mahabharat.\n\n Poets describe the vow that Bheeshma made: āju jo harihiṅ na śhastra gahāūñ, tau lājahuñ gaṅgā jananī ko śhāntanu suta na kahāūñ  \n***(Saint Soordas)***\n [v2] “If I do not make the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna lift weapons, then I will shame my mother Ganga, and I am not the son of King Shantanu.”\n\n Bheeshma fought so valiantly that Arjun’s chariot was shattered, and he was stranded on the ground.\n\n At that stage, Shree Krishna lifted the chariot wheel and came forward to prevent Bheeshma from killing Arjun.\n\n Bheeshma saw the Lord with the chariot wheel in his hand as a weapon, and broke into a big sm.\n\n He understood that Bhaktavatsala Bhagavān  \n***(God who gives pleasure to his devotees)***\n had broken his own vow to honor the vow of his devotee.\n\n In fact, Bheeshma’s devotion to Lord Krishna had a very rasik  \n***(full of sweetness)***\n flavor to it.\n\n He used to meditate on Shree Krishna’s pastimes in Vrindavan.\n\n There, in the evening when the Lord would return to the village after grazing the cows in the forest, the dust raised from the hooves of the cows would deck his charming face, increasing its beauty and sweetness.\n\n During the battle of Mahabharat, the dust raised from the hooves of the horses too added to Shree Krishna’s beauty, and he loved having darśhan  \n***(divine vision)***\n of his Lord there.\n\n In the last stage of his life, as he lay for six months on the bed of arrows, he meditated on that very vision of God, offering the following prayer to Him: yudhi turaga-rajo-vidhūmra-viṣhvak-kacha-lulita-śhramavāry-alaṅkṛitāsye mama niśhita-śharair vibhidyamāna-tvachi vilasat-kavache ’stu kṛiṣhṇa ātmā  \n***(Bhāgavatam ..34)***\n [v3] “On the battlefield, Lord Krishna’s flowing hair was covered with white dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and his face was covered with sweat beads because of his physical effort in driving the chariot.\n\n These were like ornaments enhancing the beauty of my Lord; and the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows further intensified the decorations.\n\n Let my mind meditate unto that Shree Krishna.”\n\n Lord Krishna reciprocated his loving devotion by himself coming to meet Bheeshma on his deathbed of arrows, and with the darśhan of God in front of him, Bheeshma, the great mahājan , left his body, of his own volition.",

Who are you?” Socrates answered with amusement, “My dear fellow, I have been pondering over that question for the last forty years.\n\n If you ever come to know who I am, please let me know.”\n\n In the Vedic tradition, whenever divine knowledge is imparted, it usually begins with knowledge of the self.\n\n Shree Krishna follows the same approach in the Bhagavad Gita , with a piece of information that would have swept Socrates off his feet.\n\n Shree Krishna begins by explaining that the entity that we call the “self” is really the soul, not the material body, and is eternal, just as God himself is etern.\n\n The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states: jñājñau dwāvajā vīśhanīśhāvajā hyekā bhoktṛi bhogyārtha yuktā anantaśhchātmā viśhwarūpo hyakartā trayaṁ yadā vindate brahmametat  \n***(.9)***\n [v9] The above verse states that creation is a combination of three entities—God, soul, and Maya—and all the three entities are etern.\n\n If we believe the soul is eternal, then it follows logically that there is life after death of the material body.\n\n Shree Krishna talks about this in the next verse.",

        "explanation": "With immaculate logic, Shree Krishna establishes the principle of transmigration of the soul from lifetime to lifet.\n\n He explains that in one lifetime itself, we change bodies from childhood to youth to maturity and then to old age.\n\n In fact, modern science informs us that cells within the body undergo regeneration—old cells die away and new ones take their place.\n\n It is estimated that within seven years, practically all the cells of the body change.\n\n Further, the molecules within the cells change even more rapidly.\n\n With every breath we inhale, oxygen molecules are absorbed into our cells via the metabolic processes, and molecules that were heretofore locked within the cells are released as carbon diox.\n\n Scientists estimate that in one year’s time, about ninety-eight percent of our bodily molecules change.\n\n And yet, despite the continual change of the body, we perceive that we are the same person.\n\n That is because we are not the material body, but the spiritual soul seated within.\n\n In this verse, the word deha means “the body” and dehi means “possessor of the body, ” or the soul.\n\n Shree Krishna draws Arjun’s attention to the fact that, since the body is constantly changing, in one lifetime itself, the soul passes through many bodies.\n\n Similarly, at the time of death, it passes into another body.\n\n Actually, what we term as “death” in worldly parlance is merely the soul discarding its old dysfunctional body, and what we call “birth” is the soul taking on a new body elsewhere.\n\n This is the principle of reincarnation.\n\n Most Oriental philosophies accept this concept of reincarnation.\n\n It is an integral part of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism.\n\n In Buddhism, the Buddha made references to his past lives repeatedly.\n\n Many people do not know the extent to which reincarnation was a part of the belief system of the Occidental philosophies as well.\n\n In ancient classical Western religious and philosophic circles, famous thinkers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates accepted reincarnation to be true, and their views were also reflected in Orphism, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Manichaenism, and Gnosticism.\n\n Within the mainstream Abrahamic faiths, mystics of the three major religions also supported reincarnation.\n\n Examples include Jews who studied the Kabbalah, the Christian Cathars, and Muslim Shia sects such as the Alawi Shias and the Druze.\n\n \n\nFor example, amongst Occidental religions, Josephus, the great ancient Jewish historian, used language in his writings that seem to ascribe belief in some form of reincarnation among the Pharisees and Essenes of his day.\n\n Certainly the Jewish Kabbalah prescribes to the idea of reincarnation as gilgul neshamot, or the “rolling of the soul.”\n\n The great Sufi mystic, Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi declared: I died out of the stone and I became a plant; I died out of the plant and became an animal; I died out of the animal and became a man.\n\n Why then should I fear to die? When did I grow less by dying? I shall die out of man and shall become an angel!” [v10] Many of the early Christians believed in the concept of reincarnation.\n\n Christian history informs us that, in the 553 AD, the Council of Nicaea, a conclave, was held to discuss the principle of reincarnation, and it was thereafter declared a heresy, apparently to increase the authority of the Church over the lives of the people.\n\n Until then, it was commonly accepted.\n\n Jesus indirectly proclaimed this doctrine when he told his disciples that John the Baptist was Elijah the Prophet reincarnated  \n***(Matthew 11:13-14, Matthew 17:10-13)***\n.\n\n This is also mentioned in the Old Testament  \n***(Malachi 4:5)***\n.\n\n Origen, the most learned of the Christian Fathers, declared: “Every man receives a body for himself according to his deserts in former lives [v11].”\n\n Solomon’s Book of Wisdom says: “To be born in sound body with sound limbs is a reward of the virtues of the past lives.”\n\n  \n***(Wisdom of Solomon 8:19-20)***\n [v12] Belief in reincarnation is also found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia.\n\n Moving to more recent centuries and civilizations, reincarnation has been affirmed by Rosicrucians, Spiritism, Theosophists, and New Age followers.\n\n Even more recently, it has even been studied in serious scientific circles at major universities, exemplified by the works of . Ian Stevenson and . Jim Tucker, both at the University of Virginia.\n\n Without accepting the concept of rebirth, it is difficult to make sense out of the suffering, chaos, and incompleteness of the world, and hence, many famous western thinkers believed in this principle.\n\n Virgil and Ovid regarded this doctrine as self-evident.\n\n The German philosophers Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, and Lessing accepted it.\n\n Amongst the more recent philosophers, Hume, Spencer, and Max Mueller, all recognized it as an incontrovertible doctr.\n\n Among Western poets, Browing, Rosetti, Tennyson, and Wordsworth, to mention just a few, all believed in it.\n\n Shree Krishna has previously declared that the wise do not lament.\n\n But the fact remains that we do experience happiness and distress.\n\n What is the reason for it?

The answer to the first question is very simple.\n\n God is an ocean of infinite bliss, and we souls are his tiny parts.\n\n This basically means that we are tiny fragments of an infinite ocean of bliss.\n\n Swami Vivekananda would address people by saying, “O ye children of immortal bliss.”\n\n Just as a child is drawn to his or her mother, each part is naturally drawn toward its whole.\n\n Similarly, being infinitesimal parts of the ocean of bliss, we souls too are drawn to this bliss.\n\n Hence, everything we do in the world is for the sake of happiness.\n\n We all may have different views regarding where happiness lies or what form it might take, but all living beings seek nothing apart from it.\n\n This answers the first question.\n\n \n\nNow, let’s understand the answer to the second question.\n\n The soul, being a tiny part of God, is divine in nature like God himself.\n\n Hence the happiness that the soul seeks is also div.\n\n Such happiness must possess the following three characteristics: It must be infinite in extent.\n\n It must be permanent.\n\n It must be ever-fresh.\n\n Such is the happiness of God, which is described as sat-chit-ānand , or eternal-sentient-ocean of bliss.\n\n \n\nHowever, the happiness we experience from the contact of the senses with their objects is the reverse; it is temporary, finite, and insentient.\n\n \n\nThus, the material happiness that we perceive through the body can never satisfy the divine soul.\n\n With this discrimination, we must practice to tolerate the perception of material happiness.\n\n Similarly, we must tolerate the sensation of material distress.\n\n  \n***(This second aspect is discussed in detail in many future verses, such as .48, .20, .)***\n Only then will we rise above these dualities and the material energy will no longer bind us.",

The soul is imperishable, and hence it is sat . \n\nHowever, the body will cease to exist one day, and hence it is asat  \n***(temporary)***\n.\n\n The soul is also sat-chit-ānand , but it is also aṇu  \n***(tiny)***\n.\n\n Hence the soul is aṇu sat , aṇu chit , and aṇu ānand . . The entity Maya from which the world has been made is eternal, or sat . \n\nHowever, all material objects we see around us came into existence and will be destroyed with t.\n\n \n\nThus, they can all be termed as asat , or temporary.\n\n So while the world itself is asat , it is only the entity Maya that is sat . When we say that the world is asat , this should not be confused with mithyā . Asat  \n***(temporary)***\n does not mean mithyā  \n***(non-existent)***\n.\n\n Some philosophers claim that the world is mithyā , or “non-existent.”\n\n They assert that it is only the ignorance within us that is making us perceive the world, and once we are situated in brahma-jñāna  \n***(knowledge of the Supreme)***\n the world will cease to exist.\n\n \n\nHowever, if this were true, then the world should no longer have remained for the God-realized Saints.\n\n Since they had destroyed their ignorance, the world should have stopped existing for them.\n\n Why then did these Saints write books even after attaining the state of God-realization? Where did the paper and pen come from? The fact that brahma-jñānīs use the objects of the world proves that the world exists even for them.\n\n Besides, even brahma-jñānīs need food to nourish their bodies.\n\n The Vedic scriptures state: paśhvādibhiśhchāviśheṣhat [v16] “Even God-realized Saints feels hungry, just as animals do, and need to eat food.”\n\n If the world does not exist for them, then how and why should they eat? Further, the Taittirīya Upaniṣhad repeatedly informs us that God is all-pervading in the world: so ’kāmayata bahu syāṁ prajāyeyeti sa tapo ’tapyata sa tapastaptvā idaṁsarvamasṛijata yadidaṁ kiṁ cha tatsṛiṣhtvā tadevānuprāviṣhat tadanupraviśhya sachcha tyachchābhavat niruktaṁ chāniruktaṁ cha nilayanaṁ chānilaynaṁ cha vijñānaṁ chāvijñānaṁ cha satyaṁ chānṛitam cha satyamabhavat yadidaṁ kiṁ cha tatsatyamityāchakṣhate tadapyeṣha śhloko bhavati  \n***(..4)***\n [v17] This Vedic mantra states that God not only created the world, but also permeates every atom of it.\n\n If God is truly all-pervading in this world, then how can the world have no existence? To say that the world is mithyā is to contradict the fact that God pervades the world.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna explains that the world does exist, but it is fleeting.\n\n \n\nThus, he calls it as asat , or “temporary.”\n\n He does not call it mithyā , or “non-existent.”\n\n",

We will not go into the details of these schools here.\n\n Let it suffice for now to know that all these schools of thought accept the Vedas as the authority of reference.\n\n Accordingly, they all accept the eternal, unchangeable soul as the self.\n\n The remaining six schools of Indian philosophy do not accept the authority of the Vedas.\n\n These are Chārvāk vāda , the four Buddhist schools  \n***( Yogāchār vāda, Mādhyamik vāda, Vaibhāśhik vāda, and Sautāntrik vāda )***\n, and Jainism.\n\n Each of these has its own explanation for the nature of the self.\n\n Chārvāka vāda states that the body itself comprises the self, and consciousness is merely a product of the conglomeration of its constituents.\n\n Jainism states that the soul is the same size as the body, and hence, it is subject to change from birth to birth.\n\n The Buddhist schools of thought do not accept the existence of a permanent soul, and instead maintain that there is a stream of renewed animation from lifetime to lifetime, which ensures continuity of the individu.\n\n It seems that at the time of Shree Krishna too, versions of the Buddhist philosophy of renewed animation and non-permanence of the soul existed.\n\n Hence he is explaining that even if Arjun subscribes to this philosophy of renewed animation of the self from life to life, there is still no reason to lament.\n\n Why should one not lament? This is now explained in the next verse.",

The Mahabharat relates an incident regarding this.\n\n During the period of their exile in the forest, one day while wandering the five Pandavas were thirsty and came across a well.\n\n Yudhishthir asked Bheem to go and fetch water for all of them.\n\n When Bheem reached the well, a yakṣha  \n***(semi-celestial being)***\n began speaking from inside the well, “I will only let you take the water if you first answer my questions.”\n\n Bheem paid no heed and proceeded to draw water.\n\n The yakṣha pulled him in.\n\n After some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water.\n\n When Arjun reached the well, the yakṣha asked him too, “I have already seized your brother.\n\n Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.”\n\n Arjun also paid no heed, and the yakṣha pulled him into the well.\n\n The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate.\n\n Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well.\n\n Once again, the yakṣha said, “Answer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.”\n\n Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions.\n\n The yakṣha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disgu.\n\n He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir.\n\n One of these questions was: kim āśhcharyaṁ? “What is the most surprising thing in this world?” Yudhisthir replied: ahany ahani bhūtāni gachchhantīha yamālayam śheṣhāḥ sthiratvam ichchhanti kimāśhcharyamataḥ param  \n***(Mahabharat)***\n [v30] “At every moment people are dying.\n\n Those who are alive are witnessing this phenomenon, and yet they do not think that one day they will also have to die.\n\n What can be more astonishing than this?” Shree Krishna explains in this verse that life is inescapably a dead end, and so a wise person does not lament over the inevitable.",

Is there any role of the intellect in eliminating attachment? Within our body is the subtle antaḥ karaṇ , which we also colloquially refer to as the heart.\n\n It consists of the mind, the intellect, and the ego.\n\n In this subtle machine, the intellect is superior to the mind.\n\n It makes decisions while the mind creates desires and gets attached to the object of affection as determined by the intellect.\n\n For instance, if the intellect decides that money is the source of happiness, the mind hankers for wealth.\n\n If the intellect decides that prestige is the most important thing in life, the mind craves for reputation and fame.\n\n In other words, the mind develops desires in accordance with the knowledge of the intellect.\n\n Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect.\n\n While sitting at home, we adopt informal postures in which the mind finds comfort.\n\n Yet, we adopt appropriate formal postures while sitting in the off.\n\n It is not that the mind enjoys the formality of the office—given its way, it would rather embrace the informality of home.\n\n \n\nHowever, the intellect decides that formal behavior is necessary in the off.\n\n So the intellect controls the mind, and people sit formally all day long, following the decorum of the workplace, against the nature of the mind.\n\n Similarly, the mind does not enjoy doing office work—if it had its way, it would rather sit at home and watch television.\n\n But the intellect rules that working in office is necessary to earn a living.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the intellect again reins in the natural tendency of the mind, and people work eight hours a day, or longer.\n\n The above examples illustrate that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind.\n\n \n\nThus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction.\n\n Buddhi yog is the art of detaching the mind from the fruits of actions, by developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work is meant for the pleasure of God.\n\n Such a person of resolute intellect cultivates single-minded focus on the goal, and traverses the path like an arrow released from the bow.\n\n This resolve becomes so strong in higher stages of sādhanā that nothing can deter the sādhak from treading the path.\n\n He or she thinks, “Even if there are millions of obstacles on my path, even if the whole world condemns me, even if I have to lay down my life, I will still not give up my sādhanā .” But those whose intellect is many-branched find their mind running in various directions.\n\n They are unable to develop the focus of mind that is required to tread the path to God.",

        "explanation": "This is an extremely popular verse of the Bhagavad Gita , so much so that even most school children in India are familiar with it.\n\n It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted whenever the topic of karm yog is discussed.\n\n The verse gives four instructions regarding the science of work: 1) Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results.\n\n 2) The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment.\n\n 3) Even while working, give up the pride of doershi.\n\n 4) Do not be attached to inaction.\n\n Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results.\n\n We have the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts.\n\n A number of factors come into play in determining the results—our efforts, destiny  \n***(our past karmas)***\n, the will of God, the efforts of others, the cumulative karmas of the people involved, the place and situation  \n***(a matter of luck)***\n, . \n\nNow if we become anxious for results, we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations.\n\n So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job.\n\n The fact is that when we are unconcerned about the results, we are able to focus entirely on our efforts, and the result is even better than before.\n\n A humorous acronym for this is NATO or Not Attached to Outcome.\n\n Consider its application to a simple everyday activity such as playing golf.\n\n When people play golf, they are engrossed in the fruits—whether their score is under par, over par, . \n\nNow if they could merely focus on playing the shots to the best of their ability, they would find it the most enjoyable game of golf they have ever played.\n\n Additionally, with their complete focus on the shot being played, their game would be raised to a higher level.\n\n The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment.\n\n To perform actions is an integral part of human nature.\n\n Having come into this world, we all have various duties determined by our family situation, social position, occupation, . While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results—the results are meant for the pleasure of God.\n\n The individual soul is a tiny part of God  \n***(verse 1.7)***\n, and hence our inherent nature is to serve him through all our actions.\n\n dāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamam śhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatāṁprabhurīśhwaraḥ  \n***(Padma Puran)***\n[v40] “God is the Master of the entire creation; all moving and non-moving beings are his servants.”\n\n Material consciousness is characterized by the following manner of thoughts, “I am the proprietor of all that I possess.\n\n It is all meant for my enjoyment.\n\n I have the right to enhance my possessions and maximize my enjoyment.”\n\n The reverse of this is Spiritual consciousness, which is characterized by thoughts such as, “God is the owner and enjoyer of this entire world.\n\n I am merely his selfless servant.\n\n I must use all that I have in the service of God.”\n\n Accordingly, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun not to think of himself as the enjoyer of the fruits of his actions.\n\n Even while working, give up the pride of doershi.\n\n Shree Krishna wants Arjun to give up kartritwābhimān , or the ego of being the doer.\n\n He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions.\n\n \n\nHowever, when we perform actions, then why should we not consider ourselves as the doers of those actions? The reason is that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our dispos.\n\n As a result, only with the help of the power we receive from him, are we able to work.\n\n \n\nFor example, the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves, but they get energized by someone’s hand, and then they perform even difficult tasks, such as lifting burning coal, . \n\nNow if we say that the tongs are the doers of actions, it will be inaccurate.\n\n If the hand did not energize them, what would they be able to do? They would merely lie inert on the table.\n\n Similarly, if God did not supply our body-mind-soul mechanism with the power to perform actions, we could have done nothing.\n\n \n\nThus, we must give up the ego of doing, remembering that God is the only source of the power by which we perform all our actions.\n\n All the above thoughts are very nicely summarized in the following popular Sanskrit verse: yatkṛitaṁ yatkariṣhyāmi tatsarvaṁ na mayā kṛitam tvayā kṛitaṁ tu phalabhuk tvameva madhusūdana [v41] “Whatever I have achieved and whatever I wish to achieve, I am not the doer of these.\n\n O Madhusudan, you are the real doer, and you alone are the enjoyer of their results.”\n\n Do not be attached to inaction.\n\n Although the nature of the living being is to work, often situations arise where work seems burdensome and confusing.\n\n In such cases, instead of running away from it, we must understand and implement the proper science of work, as explained by Shree Krishna to Arjun.\n\n \n\nHowever, it is highly inappropriate if we consider work as laborious and burdensome, and resort to inaction.\n\n Becoming attached to inaction is never the solution and is clearly condemned by Shree Krishna.",

        "explanation": "Upon hearing the science of karm-yog , people often wonder that if they give up attachment to results, will their performance go down? Shree Krishna explains that working without personal motivation does not reduce the quality of our work; instead we become even more skillful than before.\n\n Consider the example of a sincere surgeon who cuts people with his knife while operating upon them.\n\n He performs his duty with equanimity, and is undisturbed irrespective of whether the patient survives or dies.\n\n This is because he is merely doing his duty unselfishly, to the best of his ability, and is not attached to the results.\n\n Hence, even if the patient dies while being operated upon, the surgeon does not feel guilty of murder.\n\n \n\nHowever, if the same surgeon’s only child needs to be operated, he does not have the courage to do so.\n\n Because of attachment to the results, he fears he will not be able to perform the operation skillfully, and so he seeks the help of another surgeon.\n\n This shows that attachment to results does not make us more skillful; rather, the attachment affects our performance adversely.\n\n Instead, if we work without attachment, we can do so at our maximum skill level, without feeling nervous, jittery, scared, tense, or excited.\n\n Likewise, Arjun’s personal example also illustrates the point that giving up attachment to the fruits does not adversely affect performance.\n\n Before hearing the Bhagavad Gita , he intended to engage in war with the desire of winning a kingdom.\n\n After hearing the Bhagavad Gita from Shree Krishna, he was fighting because it was his duty to God, and Shree Krishna would be pleased by it.\n\n He was still a warrior; however, his internal motivation had changed.\n\n The fact that he did his duty without attachment did not make him any less competent than before.\n\n In fact, he fought with greater inspiration because his work was directly in service of God.",

        "explanation": "The senses are like wild horses that have been newly harnessed.\n\n They are impetuous and reckless, and hence, disciplining them is an important battle that sādhaks have to fight within themselves.\n\n \n\nTherefore, those desirous of spiritual growth should carefully strive to tame the indulgent senses, which are colored with lust and greed, or else they have the power to sabotage and derail the spiritual process of even the most well-intentioned yogis.\n\n The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam relates a story that perfectly illustrates this statement  \n***(canto 9, chapter 6)***\n.\n\n There was a great sage in ancient times, known as Saubhari.\n\n He is mentioned in the Rig Veda, where there is a mantra called Saubhari Sutra.\n\n There is also a scripture called the Saubhari Samhita.\n\n So he was not just an ordinary sage.\n\n Saubhari had attained such control over his body that he used to submerge himself in the river Yamuna and meditate under water.\n\n One day, he saw two fish mating.\n\n This sight carried away his mind and senses, and the desire for sexual association arose in him.\n\n He abandoned his spiritual practice and came out of the water, wondering how to fulfill his des.\n\n At that time, the king of Ayodhya was Mandhata, who was a very illustrious and noble ruler.\n\n He had fifty daughters, each more beautiful than the other.\n\n Saubhari approached the king and asked for the hand of one of the fifty princesses.\n\n King Mandhata wondered about the sanity of the sage and thought to himself, “An old man wanting to get married!” The king knew Saubhari to be a powerful sage, and feared that if he refused, the sage might curse him.\n\n But if he consented, the life of one of his daughters would be ruined.\n\n He was in a dilemma.\n\n So he said, “O holy one! I have no objection to your request.\n\n Please take a seat.\n\n I shall bring my fifty daughters before you, and whosoever chooses you will become yours in marriage.”\n\n The king was confident that none of his daughters would choose the old ascetic, and in this way, he would be saved from the sage’s curse.\n\n Saubhari was all too aware of the king’s intention.\n\n He told the king that he would return the following day.\n\n That evening, he used his yogic powers to turn himself into a handsome young man.\n\n Consequently, when he presented himself at the palace the next day, all the fifty princesses chose him as their husband.\n\n The king was bound by the word he had given and was compelled to marry all his daughters to the sage.\n\n \n\nNow the king was concerned about the fights that would take place amongst the fifty sisters, since they would have to share a husband.\n\n \n\nHowever, Saubhari again used his yogic powers.\n\n Putting the king’s apprehension to rest, he assumed fifty forms and created fifty palaces for his wives, and lived separately with each one of them.\n\n In this manner, thousands of years passed by.\n\n The Puranas state that Saubhari had many children from each of them, and those children had further children, until a tiny city had been created.\n\n One day, Saubhari came to his senses, and exclaimed, aho imaṁ paśhyata me vināśhaṁ  \n***(Bhāgavatam ..50)***\n [v51] “O humans! Those of you, who make plans to attain happiness through material acquisitions, be careful.\n\n Look at my degradation—where I was and where am I now.\n\n I created fifty bodies by my yogic powers, and lived with fifty women for thousands of years.\n\n And yet, the senses did not experience fulfillment; they only kept hankering for more.\n\n Learn from my downfall and be warned not to venture in this direction.”\n\n",

        "explanation": "Anger, greed, lust, . are considered in the Vedic scriptures as mānas rog , or diseases of the mind.\n\n The Ramayan states: mānas roga kachhuka maiṅ gāe hahiṅ saba keṅ lakhi biralenha pāe [v53] We are all aware of the diseases of the body—even a single bodily ailment has the power to make one’s whole day miserable—but we do not realize that we are being continuously tormented by multiple mental ailments.\n\n And since we do not recognize lust, anger, greed, . as mental diseases, we do not try to cure them.\n\n Psychology is a branch of human knowledge that attempts to analyze these ailments and propose solutions to them.\n\n \n\nHowever, both the analysis and the solution presented by western psychology leave much to be desired, and appear to be gross approximations of the reality of the mind.\n\n In this and the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna has given perfect and penetrating insight into functioning of the mind.\n\n He explains that when we repeatedly contemplate that there is happiness in some object, the mind becomes attached to it.\n\n \n\nFor example, in a class there are a number of boys and girls, and they interact innocuously with each other.\n\n One day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, “I would be very happy if she were m.”\n\n As he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her.\n\n He tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her.\n\n His friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her.\n\n Why is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her? The fact is that he repeatedly thought that there was happiness in the girl, and so his mind became attached to her.\n\n \n\nNow attachment seems quite innocuous by itself.\n\n But the problem is that from attachment comes des.\n\n If one is attached to drinks, the desire for drinks comes repeatedly to the mind.\n\n If one is attached to cigarettes, then thoughts of the pleasure of smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow in the mind, creating a craving for them.\n\n In this way, attachment leads to des.\n\n Once desire develops, it gives birth to two more problems—greed and anger.\n\n Greed comes from the fulfillment of des.\n\n Jimi pratilābha lobha adhikāī  \n***(Ramayan)***\n [v54] “If you satisfy desire, it leads to greed.”\n\n \n\nThus desire is never eliminated by satiating it: yat pṛithivyāṁ vrīhi-yavaṁ hiraṇyaṁ paśhavaḥ striyaḥ na duhyanti manaḥ-prītiṁ puṁsaḥ kāma-hatasya te  \n***(Bhāgavatam .1.13)***\n [v55] “If one person were to get all the wealth, luxuries, and sensual objects in the world, that person’s desire would still not be satiated.\n\n Hence, knowing it to be the cause of misery, an intelligent person should renounce des.”\n\n On the flip side what happens if the fulfillment of desire is obstructed? It gives rise to anger.\n\n Bear in mind that anger does not arise by itself.\n\n It is created from the obstruction of desire; and desire arises from attachment, while attachment comes from contemplation of the sense objects.\n\n In this manner, we see how the simple act of contemplating the pleasures of sense objects leads downward to the twin diseases of greed and anger.\n\n In the next verse Shree Krishna continues the chain further down, and explains the consequences of anger.",

What happened to me?” What happened was that the faculty of judgment was affected by anger, and hence the mistake of scolding an elder was made.\n\n When the intellect is clouded, it leads to bewilderment of memory.\n\n The person then forgets what is right and what is wrong, and flows along with the surge of emotions.\n\n The downward descent continues from there, and bewilderment of memory results in destruction of the intellect.\n\n And since the intellect is the internal guide, when it gets destroyed, one is ruined.\n\n In this manner, the path of descent from divinity to impiety has been described beginning with contemplation on the sense objects to the destruction of the intellect.",

        "explanation": "The entire downward spiral leading to ruin begins with contemplating happiness in sense objects.\n\n \n\nNow, the urge for happiness is as natural to the soul as thirst is to the physical body.\n\n It is impossible to think “I will not contemplate happiness anywhere, ” because it is unnatural for the soul.\n\n The simple solution then is to envision happiness in the proper direction, . in God.\n\n If we can repeatedly revise the thought that happiness is in God, we will develop attachment toward him.\n\n This divine attachment will not degrade the mind like material attachment; rather, it will purify it.\n\n God is all-pure, and when we attach our mind to him, the mind will also become pure.\n\n \n\nThus, whenever Shree Krishna asks us to give up attachment and desire, he is referring only to material attachment and des.\n\n Spiritual attachment and desire are not to be given up; in fact, they are most praiseworthy.\n\n They are to be cultivated and increased for purification of the mind.\n\n The greater the burning desire we develop for God, the purer our mind will become.\n\n The jñānīs who propound the worship of the undifferentiated attributeless Brahman do not understand this point when they recommend giving up all attachments.\n\n \n\nHowever, Shree Krishna states: “Those who attach their minds to me with unadulterated devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and attain the level of the supreme Brahman .”  \n***( Bhagavad Gita 1.26)***\n He repeatedly urges Arjun to attach his mind to God in many verses ahead, such as .7, .14, .22, .34, 1.10, 1.8, 1.54, 1.55, 1.58, 1.65, . Attachment and aversion are two sides of the same coin.\n\n Aversion is nothing but negative attachment.\n\n Just as, in attachment, the object of attachment repeatedly comes to one’s mind; similarly, in aversion, the object of hatred keeps popping into the mind.\n\n So attachment and aversion to material objects both have the same effect on the mind—they dirty it and pull it into the three modes of material nature.\n\n When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss.\n\n On experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them.\n\n \n\nThus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita prajña is free from both attachment and aversion.",

Let me remain inside my beloved flower for tonight.\n\n Tomorrow morning, when its petals open again, I will fly away.”\n\n Kāṣhṭha bhedo nipuṇopi sangṛihī kuṇṭhito bhavati padma vibhede [v57] “A bee has the power to cut through wood.\n\n But look at the attachment to the sense objects that the bee which can cut through wood is stuck inside the soft petals of the lotus.”\n\n In the meantime, an elephant came, broke the lotus from the stem, and swallowed it.\n\n The bee along with the lotus went into the stomach of the elephant.\n\n The bee was thinking, “My beloved lotus is going somewhere, and I am happily going along with it.”\n\n It died shortly thereafter.\n\n Similarly, we humans too remain engrossed in the gratification of the senses, and do not heed to the message of the Saints to engage in devotion to God.\n\n Finally, time overtakes us in the form of death.\n\n Here, Shree Krishna says that those who refuse to discipline the senses and engage in devotion continue to be rocked by the three-fold miseries of Maya.\n\n Material desires are like an itching eczema, and the more we indulge in them, the worse they become.\n\n How can we be truly happy in this state of material indulgence?",

I made a dreadful mistake; I should have remained at the brothel.\n\n My brother must be enjoying himself greatly in revelry there.”\n\n Suvrit, on the other hand, started thinking, “Why did I remain in this house of sin? My brother is so holy; he is bathing his intellect in the knowledge of the Bhāgavatam.\n\n I too should have braved the rain and reached there.\n\n After all, I am not made of salt that I would have melted in a little bit of rain.”\n\n When the rain stopped, both started out in the direction of the other.\n\n The moment they met, lightning struck them and they both died on the spot.\n\n The Yamdoots  \n***(servants of the god of Death)***\n came to take Tavrit to hell.\n\n Tavrit complained, “I think you have made a mistake.\n\n I am Tavrit.\n\n It was my brother who was sitting at the brothel a little while ago.\n\n You should be taking him to hell.”\n\n The Yamdoots replied, “We have made no mistake.\n\n He was sitting there to avoid the rain, but in his mind he was longing to be at the Bhāgavatam discourse.\n\n On the other hand, while you were sitting and hearing the discourse, your mind was yearning to be at the brothel.”\n\n Tavrit was doing exactly what Shree Krishna declares in this verse; he had externally renounced the objects of the senses, but was dwelling upon them in the mind.\n\n This was the improper kind of renunciation.\n\n The next verse states the proper kind of renunciation.",

Everyone knows that Raghu has donated everything he owned.”\n\n Raghu replied, “Go and ask your king that when he came into this world did he possess anything? He was born empty-handed, is it not? Then what was his that he has given away?” This is the spirit of karm yog , in which we see the whole world as belonging to God, and hence meant for the satisfaction of God.\n\n We then perform our duties not for gratifying our mind and senses, but for the pleasure of God.\n\n Lord Vishnu instructed the Prachetas in this fashion: gṛiheṣhv āviśhatāṁ chāpi puṁsāṁ kuśhala-karmaṇām mad-vārtā-yāta-yāmānāṁ na bandhāya gṛihā matāḥ  \n***(Bhāgavatam .3.19)***\n[v6] “The perfect karm yogis , even while fulfilling their household duties, perform all their works as yajña to me, knowing me to be the Enjoyer of all activities.\n\n They spend whatever free time they have in hearing and chanting my glories.\n\n Such people, though living in the world, never get bound by their actions.”\n\n",

The answer to this question is that the Vedas prescribe a vegetarian diet for humans, which includes grains, pulses and beans, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, . Apart from the Vedic culture, many spiritually evolved souls in the history of all cultures around the world also rejected a non-vegetarian diet that makes the stomach a graveyard for animals.\n\n Even though many of them were born in meat-eating families, they gravitated to a vegetarian lifestyle as they advanced on the path of spirituality.\n\n Here are quotations from some famous thinkers and personalities advocating vegetarianism: “To avoid causing terror to living beings, let the disciple refrain from eating meat… the food of the wise is that which is consumed by the sādhus ; it does not consist of meat.”\n\n The Buddha.\n\n “If you declare that you are naturally designed for such a diet, then first kill for yourself what you want to eat.\n\n Do it, however, only through your own resources, unaided by cleaver or cudgel or any kind of ax.”\n\n The Roman Plutarch, in the essay, “On Eating Flesh.”\n\n “As long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other.\n\n Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.”\n\n Pythagoras “Truly man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds them.\n\n We live by the death of others.\n\n We are burial places! I have since an early age abjured the use of meat…” Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n “Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution.\n\n Until we stop harming all living beings, we are all savages.”\n\n Thomas Edison.\n\n “Flesh-eating is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to moral feeling—killing.”\n\n Leo Tolstoy.\n\n “It may indeed be doubted whether butchers’ meat is anywhere a necessary of life… Decency nowhere requires that any man should eat butchers’ meat.”\n\n Adam Smith.\n\n “I look my age.\n\n It is the other people who look older than they are.\n\n What can you expect from people who eat corpses?” George Bernard Shaw.\n\n “A dead cow or sheep lying in a pasture is recognized as carrion.\n\n The same sort of carcass dressed and hung up in a butcher’s stall passes as food!” . . Kellogg.\n\n “It is my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.”\n\n Albert Einstein “I do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.”\n\n Mahatma Gandhi In this verse, Shree Krishna goes further and says that even vegetation contains life, and if we eat it for our own sense enjoyment, we get bound in the karmic reactions of destroying l.\n\n The word used in the verse is ātma-kāraṇāt , meaning “for one’s individual pleasure.”\n\n \n\nHowever, if we eat food as remnants of yajña offered to God then the consciousness changes.\n\n We then look upon our body as the property of God, which has been put under our care for his serv.\n\n And we partake of permitted food, as his grace, with the intention that it will nourish the body.\n\n In this sentiment, the entire process is consecrated to the Div.\n\n Bharat Muni states: vasusato kratu dakṣhau kāla kāmau dṛitiḥ kuruḥ pururavā madravāśhcha viśhwadevāḥ prakīrtitāḥ [v8] “Violence is caused unknowingly to living entities in the process of cooking, by the use of the pestle, fire, grinding instruments, water pot, and broom.\n\n Those who cook food for themselves become implicated in the sin.\n\n But yajña nullifies the sinful reactions.”\n\n",

When we identify the self with the body, we identify with the yearnings of the body and mind as the desires of the self, and these send us spinning into the realm of Maya.\n\n Sage Tulsidas explains: jiba jiba te hari te bilagāno taba te deha geha nija mānyo, māyā basa swarūp bisarāyo tehi brama te dāruṇa duḥkh pāyo.\n\n [ v13] “When the soul separated itself from God, the material energy covered it in an illusion.\n\n By virtue of that illusion, it began thinking of itself as the body, and ever since, in forgetfulness of the self, it has been experiencing immense misery.”\n\n Those who are illumined realize that the self is not material in nature, but divine, and hence imperishable.\n\n The perishable objects of the world can never fulfill the thirst of the imperishable soul, and therefore it is a folly to hanker after those sense-objects.\n\n \n\nThus, self-illumined souls learn to unite their consciousness with God and experience his infinite bliss within them.\n\n The karm  \n***(duties)***\n prescribed for the materially conditioned souls are no longer applicable to such illumined souls because they have already attained the goal of all such karm . \n\nFor example, as long as one is a college student, one is obliged to follow the rules of the university, but for one who has graduated and earned the degree, the rules now become irrelevant.\n\n For such liberated souls, it is said: brahmavit śhruti mūrdhnī [v14] “Those who have united themselves with God now walk on the head of the Vedas, ” . they have no need to follow the rules of the Vedas any longer.\n\n The goal of the Vedas is to help unite the soul with God.\n\n Once the soul becomes God-realized, the rules of the Vedas, which helped the soul to reach that destination, now no longer apply; the soul has transcended their area of jurisdiction.\n\n \n\nFor example, a pundit unites a man and woman in wedlock by performing the marriage ceremony.\n\n Once the ceremony is over, he says, “You are now husband and wife; I am leaving.”\n\n His task is over.\n\n If the wife says, “Punditji, the vows you made us take during the marriage ceremony are not being followed by my husband, the pundit will reply, “That is not my area of expert.\n\n My duty was to get you both united in marriage and that work is over.”\n\n Similarly the Vedas are there to help unite the self with the Supreme Self.\n\n When God-realization takes place, the task of the Vedas is over.\n\n Such an enlightened soul is no longer obliged to perform the Vedic duties.",

The reason is that, in the grip of the unforgiving ego, the soul falsely identifies itself with the body.\n\n Hence, it remains under the illusion of doershi.\n\n Let us say there are two trains standing side-by-side on the railway platform, and a passenger on one train fixes his gaze on the other.\n\n When the second train moves, it seems that the first is moving.\n\n Likewise the immobile soul identifies with the mobility of prakṛiti . \n\nThus, it perceives itself as the doer of actions.\n\n The moment the soul eliminates the ego and surrenders to the will of God, it realizes itself as the non-doer.\n\n One may question that if the soul is truly the non-doer, then why is it implicated in law of karma for actions performed by the body? The reason is that the soul does not itself perform actions, but it does direct the actions of the senses-mind-intellect.\n\n \n\nFor example, a chariot driver does not pull the chariot himself, but he does direct the horses.\n\n \n\nNow, if there is any accident, it is not the horses that are blamed, but the driver who was directing them.\n\n Similarly, the soul is held responsible for the actions of the mind-body mechanism because the senses-mind-intellect work on receiving inspiration from the soul.",

Wherever our intellect is unable to comprehend, rather than finding fault with the teachings, we must submit our intellect, “Shree Krishna has said it.\n\n There must be veracity in it, which I cannot understand at present.\n\n Let me accept it for now and engage in spiritual sādhanā . I will be able to comprehend it in future, when I progress in spirituality through sādhanā .” This attitude is called śhraddhā , or faith.\n\n Jagadguru Shankaracharaya defines śhraddhā as:  guru vedānta vākyeṣhu dṛiḍho viśhvāsaḥ śhraddhā [v18] “ Śhraddhā is strong faith in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.”\n\n Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explained it similarly:  śhraddhā śhabde viśhwāsa kahe sudṛiḍha niśhchaya   \n***(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela, 2.62)***\n[v19] “The word Śhraddhā means strong faith in God and Guru, even though we may not comprehend their message at present.”\n\n The British poet, Alfred Tennyson said: “By faith alone, embrace believing, where we cannot prove.”\n\n So, śhraddhā means earnestly digesting the comprehensible portions of the Bhagavad Gita, and also accepting the abstruse portions, with the hope that they will become comprehensible in future.\n\n \n\nHowever, one of the persistent defects of the material intellect is pr.\n\n Due to pride, whatever the intellect cannot comprehend at present, it often rejects as incorrect.\n\n Though Shree Krishna’s teachings are presented by the omniscient Lord for the welfare of the souls, people still find fault in them, such as, “Why is God asking everything to be offered to him? Is he greedy? Is he an egotist that he asks Arjun to worship him?” Shree Krishna says that such people are achetasaḥ , or “devoid of discrimination, ” because they cannot distinguish between the pure and the impure, the righteous and the unrighteous, the Creator and the created, the Supreme Master and the servant.\n\n Such people “bring about their own ruin, ” because they reject the path to eternal salvation and keep rotating in the cycle of life and death.",

That means you remained agitated for cigarettes for two hours and when you had your puffs, you returned to the same state that you were in at 10 pm.”\n\n “What do you mean by that?” asked Ramesh.\n\n “Look, at 10 pm you did not have any desire for cigarettes, and you were peaceful.\n\n Then you yourself created the desire for them.\n\n From 10 pm to midnight, you remained agitated for cigarettes.\n\n Finally, when you smoked them, the disease, which you had created, went away, and you got to slee.\n\n I, on the other hand, did not create any desire, and slept peacefully at 10 pm itself.”\n\n In this way, we create desires for the objects of the senses of the body, and then become agitated by them.\n\n When we get the cherished object, the disease of our own creation gets eradicated, and we think of it as happiness.”\n\n \n\nHowever, if we think of ourselves as the soul and our only purpose is happiness of the soul, then it becomes easier to renounce such material desires.\n\n Shree Krishna tells Arjun to bring the senses under control, thereby slaying the lust residing in them.\n\n To accomplish this we must use the higher instruments given by God to us, as stated in the next verse.",

Or is it that God says, “I do not have the power to manifest in a form, and hence I am only a formless light.”\n\n For him to be perfect and complete, he must be both personal and formless.\n\n The difference is that while our form is created from the material energy, Maya, God’s form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya . It is thus divine, and beyond material defects.\n\n This has been nicely stated in the Padma Purāṇ: yastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥ prākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate [v4] “Wherever the Vedic scriptures state that God does not have a form, they imply that his form is not subject to the blemishes of the material energy; rather, it is a divine form.”\n\n",

Such a descension of God is called an Avatār . The word “Avatar” has been adopted from Sanskrit into English and is commonly used for people’s images on the media screen.\n\n In this text, we will be using it in its original Sanskrit connotation, to refer to the divine descension of God.\n\n Twenty four such descensions have been listed in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam.\n\n \n\nHowever, the Vedic scriptures state that there are innumerable descensions of God: janma-karmābhidhānāni santi me ’ṅga sahasraśhaḥ na śhakyante ’nusaṅkhyātum anantatvān mayāpi hi  \n***(Bhāgavatam 1.5.37)***\n[v5] “Nobody can count the infinite Avatars of God since the beginning of eternity.”\n\n These Avatars are classified in four categories, as stated below: .

Prābhavāvatār —these are the descensions of God in the personal form, where he displays some of his divine powers.\n\n Prābhavāvatārs are also of two kinds: a) Where God reveals himself only for a few moments, completes his work, and then departs.\n\n Hansavatar is an example of this, where God manifested before the Kumaras, answered their question, and left.\n\n b) Where the Avatar remains on the earth for many years.\n\n Ved Vyas, who wrote the eighteen Puranas and the Mahabharat, and divided the Vedas into four parts, is an example of such an Avatar.\n\n . Vaibhavāvatār —when God descends in his divine form, and manifests more of his divine powers.\n\n Matsyavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahavatar are all examples of Vaibhavāvatār . . Parāvasthāvatār —when God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form.\n\n Shree Krishna, Shree Ram, and Nrisinghavatar are all Parāvasthāvatār .

        "explanation": "Having stated in the last verse that God descends in the world, he now states the three reasons for doing so: 1) To annihilate the wicked.\n\n 2) To protect the pious.\n\n 3) To establish dharma.\n\n \n\nHowever, if we closely study these three points, none of the three reasons seem very convincing: To protect the righteous.\n\n God is seated in the hearts of his devotees, and always protects them from within.\n\n There is no need to take an Avatar for this purpose.\n\n To annihilate the wicked.\n\n God is all-powerful, and can kill the wicked merely by wishing it.\n\n Why should he have to take an Avatar to accomplish this? To establish dharma.\n\n Dharma is eternally described in the Vedas.\n\n God can reestablish it through a Saint; he does not need to descend himself, in his personal form, to accomplish this.\n\n How then do we make sense of the reasons that have been stated in this verse? Let’s delve a little deeper to grasp the import of what Shree Krishna is stating.\n\n The biggest dharma that the soul can engage in is devotion to God.\n\n That is what God strengthens by taking an Avatār . When God descends in the world, he reveals his divine forms, names, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and associates.\n\n This provides the souls with an easy basis for devotion.\n\n Since the mind needs a form to focus upon and to connect with, the formless aspect of God is very difficult to worshi.\n\n On the other hand, devotion to the personal form of God is easy for people to comprehend, simple to perform, and sweet to engage in.\n\n \n\nThus, since the descension of Lord Krishna 5, 000 years ago, billions of souls have made his divine leelas  \n***(pastimes)***\n as the basis of their devotion, and purified their minds with ease and joy.\n\n Similarly, the Ramayan has provided the souls with a popular basis for devotion for innumerable centuries.\n\n When the TV show, Ramayan, first began airing on Indian national television on Sunday mornings, all the streets of India would become empty.\n\n The pastimes of Lord Ram held such fascination for the people that they would be glued to their television sets to see the leelas on the screen.\n\n This reveals how Lord Ram’s descension provided the basis for devotion to billions of souls in history.\n\n The Ramayan says: rām eka tāpasa tiya tārī, nāma koṭi khala kumati sudhārī [v7] “In his descension period, Lord Ram helped only one Ahalya  \n***(Sage Gautam’s wife, whom Lord Ram released from the body of stone)***\n.\n\n \n\nHowever, since then, by chanting the divine name “Ram, ” billions of fallen souls have elevated themselves.”\n\n So a deeper understanding of this verse is: To establish dharma: God descends to establish the dharma of devotion by providing souls with his names, forms, pastimes, virtues, abodes, and associates, with the help of which they may engage in bhakti and purify their minds.\n\n To kill the wicked: Along with God, to help facilitate his divine pastimes, some liberated Saints descend and pretend to be miscreants.\n\n \n\nFor example, Ravan and Kumbhakarna were Jaya and Vijaya who descended from the divine abode of God.\n\n They pretended to be demons and opposed and fought with Ram.\n\n They could not have been killed by anyone else, since they were divine personalities.\n\n So, God slayed such demons as a part of his leelas . And having killed them, he sent them to his divine abode, since that was where they came from in the first place.\n\n To protect the righteous: Many souls had become sufficiently elevated in their sādhanā  \n***(spiritual practice)***\n to qualify to meet God face-to-face.\n\n When Shree Krishna descended in the world, these eligible souls got their first opportunity to participate in God’s divine pastimes.\n\n \n\nFor example, some gopīs  \n***(cowherd women of Vrindavan, where Shree Krishna manifested his pastimes)***\n were liberated souls who had descended from the divine abode to assist in Shree Krishna’s leelas . Other gopīs were materially bound souls who got their first chance to meet and serve God, and participate in his leelas . So when Shree Krishna descended in the world, such qualified souls got the opportunity to perfect their devotion by directly participating in the pastimes of God.\n\n This is the deeper meaning of the verse.\n\n \n\nHowever, it is not wrong if someone wishes to cognize the verse more literally or metaphorically.",

        "explanation": "Understand this verse in the light of the previous one.\n\n Our mind gets cleansed by engaging it in devotional remembrance of God.\n\n This devotion can either be toward the formless aspect of God or toward his personal form.\n\n Devotion toward the formless is intangible and nebulous to most people.\n\n They find nothing to focus upon or feel connected with during such devotional meditation.\n\n Devotion to the personal form of God is tangible and simple.\n\n Such devotion requires divine sentiments toward the personality of God.\n\n For people to engage in devotion to Shree Krishna, they must develop divine feelings toward his names, form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates.\n\n \n\nFor example, people purify their minds by worshipping stone deities because they harbor the divine sentiments that God resides in these deities.\n\n It is these sentiments that purify the devotee’s mind.\n\n The progenitor Manu says: na kāṣhṭhe vidyate devo na śhilāyāṁ na mṛitsu cha bhāve hi vidyate devastasmātbhāvaṁ samācharet [v8] “God resides neither in wood nor in stone, but in a devotional heart.\n\n Hence, worship the deity with loving sentiments.”\n\n Similarly, if we wish to engage in devotion toward Lord Krishna, we must learn to harbor divine sentiments toward his leelas . Those commentators who give a figurative interpretation to the Mahabharat and the Bhagavad Gita , do grave injustice by destroying the basis of people’s faith in devotion toward Shree Krishna.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna has emphasized the need for divine sentiments toward his pastimes, for enhancing our devotion.\n\n To develop such divine feelings, we must understand the difference between God’s actions and ours.\n\n We materially bound souls have not yet attained divine bliss, and hence the longing of our soul is not yet satiated.\n\n \n\nThus, our actions are motivated by self-interest and the desire for personal fulfillment.\n\n \n\nHowever, God’s actions have no personal motive because he is perfectly satiated by the infinite bliss of his own personality.\n\n He does not need to achieve further personal bliss by performing actions.\n\n \n\nTherefore, whatever he does is for the welfare of the materially conditioned souls.\n\n Such divine actions that God performs are termed as “ leelas ” while the actions we perform are called “work.”\n\n Similarly, God’s birth is also divine, and unlike ours, it does not take place from a mother’s womb.\n\n The all-Blissful God has no requirement to hang upside down in a mother’s womb.\n\n The Bhāgavatam states: tam adbhutaṁ bālakam ambujekṣhaṇaṁ chatur-bhujaṁ śhaṅkha gadādyudāyudham  \n***(1..9)***\n [v9] “When Shree Krishna manifested upon birth before Vasudev and Devaki, he was in his four-armed Vishnu form.”\n\n This full-sized form could definitely not have resided in Devaki’s womb.\n\n \n\nHowever, to create in her the feeling that he was there, by his Yogmaya power, he simply kept expanding Devaki’s womb.\n\n Finally, he manifested from the outside, revealing that he had never been inside her: āvirāsīd yathā prāchyāṁ diśhīndur iva puṣhkalaḥ  \n***(Bhāgavatam 1..8)***\n [v10] “As the moon manifests in its full glory in the night sky, similarly the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna manifested before Devaki and Vasudev.”\n\n This is the divine nature of God’s birth.\n\n If we can develop faith in the divinity of his pastimes and birth, then we will be able to easily engage in devotion to his personal form, and attain the supreme destination.",

        "explanation": "In the previous verse, Lord Krishna explained that those who truly know the divine nature of his birth and pastimes attain him.\n\n He now confirms that legions of human beings in all ages became God-realized by this means.\n\n They achieved this goal by purifying their minds through devotion.\n\n Shree Aurobindo put it very nicely: “You must keep the temple of the heart clean, if you wish to install therein the living presence.”\n\n The Bible states: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”\n\n  \n***(Matthew .8)***\n [v11] \n\nNow, how does the mind get purified? By giving up attachment, fear, and anger, and absorbing the mind in God.\n\n Actually, attachment is the cause of both fear and anger.\n\n Fear arises out of apprehension that the object of our attachment will be snatched away from us.\n\n And anger arises when there is an obstruction in attaining the object of our attachment.\n\n Attachment is thus the root cause of the mind getting dirty.\n\n This world of Maya consists of the three modes of material nature— sattva, rajas, and tamas  \n***(goodness, passion, and ignorance)***\n.\n\n All objects and personalities in the world come within the realm of these three modes.\n\n When we attach our mind to a material object or person, our mind too becomes affected by the three modes.\n\n Instead, when we absorb the same mind in God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, such devotion purifies the mind.\n\n \n\nThus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord.\n\n Hence, the Ramayan states: prema bhagati jala binu raghurāī, abhiantara mala kabahuñ na jāī “Without devotion to God, the dirt of the mind will not be washed away.”\n\n Even the ardent propagator of jñāna yog , Shankaracharya, stated: śhuddhayati hi nāntarātmā kṛiṣhṇapadāmbhoja bhaktimṛite  \n***(Prabodh Sudhākar)***\n[v13] “Without engaging in devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, the mind will not be cleansed.”\n\n On reading the previous verse, a question may arise whether Lord Krishna is partial in bestowing his grace upon those who absorb their minds in him versus the worldly-minded souls.\n\n The Supreme Lord addresses this in the next verse.",

Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed.\n\n On the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.\n\n Shree Krishna uses the word bhajāmi , which means “to serve.”\n\n He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love.\n\n And when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love.\n\n Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman: ekaikasyopakārasya prāṇān dāsyāmi te kape śheṣhasyehopakārāṇāṁ bhavām ṛiṇino vayaṁ  \n***(Vālmīki Ramayan)***\n[v14] “O Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you.\n\n For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.”\n\n In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.\n\n If God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead?

Some persons are inclined toward the cultivation of knowledge.\n\n This propensity finds its perfect employment in the study of scriptures for enhancing one’s understanding and love for God.\n\n sā vidyā tanmatiryayā  \n***(Bhāgavatam .2.49)***\n[v25] “True knowledge is that which increases our devotion to God.”\n\n \n\nThus, studiously inclined sādhaks engage in the sacrifice of knowledge, which when imbued with the spirit of devotion, leads to loving union with God.",

        "explanation": "In this verse, Shree Krishna compares karm sanyās and karm-yog .  It is a very deep verse; so let’s understand it one word at a t.\n\n A karm yogi is one who does both, spiritual and social, duties.\n\n  Social duties are done with the body while the mind is attached to God.\n\n  Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states: sochu mana yaha karm mama saba lakhata hari guru pyāre    \n***(Sādhan Bhakti Tattva)***\n  “Dear one!  Think always that all your actions are being observed by God and Guru.”\n\n  This is the sādhanā of karm-yog , by which we gradually elevate ourselves from bodily consciousness to spiritual consciousness.\n\n  Karm sanyās is for elevated souls, who have already risen beyond the bodily platform.\n\n  A karm sanyāsī is one who discards social duties due to complete absorption in God, and engages entirely in the performance of spiritual duties  \n***(devotional service to God)***\n.\n\n  This sentiment of karm sanyās was nicely expressed by Lakshman, when Lord Ram asked him to fulfill his worldly duties: more sabai eka tumha swāmī, dīnabandhu ura antarayāmī     \n***(Ramayan)***\n Lakshman said to Ram, “You are my Master, Father, Mother, Friend, and everything.\n\n  I will only fulfill my duty toward You with all my might.\n\n  So please do not tell me about any of my bodily duties.”\n\n Those who practice karm sanyās do not consider themselves to be the body, and as a result, they do not feel obligated to discharge their bodily duties.\n\n  Such karm sanyāsīs dedicate their full time and energy to spirituality, while karm yogis have to split their time between worldly and spiritual duties.\n\n  The karm sanyāsīs can thus move much faster toward God, while the karm yogis are encumbered with social duties.\n\n  \n\nHowever, in this verse, Shree Krishna extols karm-yog beyond karm sanyās and recommends it to Arjun as the preferred path.\n\n  This is because karm sanyāsīs are exposed to a danger.\n\n  If, having renounced their duties they cannot absorb their mind in God, they are left neither here nor there.\n\n  In India, there are tens of thousands of such sadhus, who felt they were detached, and thus, renounced the world, but their mind was not yet attached to God.\n\n  Consequently, they could not experience the divine bliss of the spiritual path.\n\n  And so, although wearing the saffron clothes of mendicants, they indulge in grossly sinful activities such as smoking opium.\n\n  Only the ignorant mistake their sloth as detachment from the world.\n\n  On the other hand, karm yogis do both their worldly duties and spiritual pract.\n\n  So if their mind turns away from spirituality, at least they have their work to fall back upon.\n\n  Karm-yog is thus the safer path for majority of the people, while karm sanyās is only to be pursued under the expert guidance of a Guru.",

        "explanation": "Karm yogis continue to discharge their worldly duties while internally practicing detachment.\n\n  Hence, they accept both positive and negative outcomes with equanimity, as the grace of God.\n\n  The Lord has designed this world so beautifully that it makes us experience both happiness and distress for our gradual elevation.\n\n  If we continue to lead our regular lives and tolerate whatever comes our way, while happily doing our duty, the world naturally pushes us toward gradual spiritual elevation.\n\n There is a sweet story that illustrates this concept.\n\n  There was once a piece of wood.\n\n  It went to a sculptor and said, “Can you please make me beautiful?”  The sculptor said, “I am ready to do that.\n\n  But are you ready for it?”  The wood replied, “Yes, I am also ready.”\n\n  The sculptor took out his tools and began hammering and chiseling.\n\n  The wood screamed, “What are you doing?  Please stop!  This is so painful.”\n\n  The sculptor replied wisely, “If you wish to become beautiful, you will have to bear the pain.”\n\n  “All right, ” said the wood, “Go ahead and do it.\n\n  But please be gentle and considerate.”\n\n  The sculptor continued his work again.\n\n  The wood kept screaming, “Enough for today; I can’t bear it any further.\n\n  Please do it tomorrow.”\n\n  The sculptor was undeterred in his task, and in a few days, the wood was transformed into a beautiful deity, fit to sit on the altar of the temple.\n\n  In the same way, our hearts are rough and unfinished because of endless lifetimes of attachment in the world.\n\n  If we wish to become internally beautiful, we must be willing to tolerate pain and let the world do its job of purifying us.\n\n  So karm yogis work with devotion, are equipoised in the results, and practice attaching their mind to God.",

        "explanation": "Living in a cave in the Himalayas, a yogi may feel that he has renounced, but the test of that renunciation comes when he returns to the city.\n\n  For instance, one sadhu practiced austerities for twelve years in the mountains of Garhw.\n\n  He came down to Haridwar to participate in the holy fair called Kumbh Melā .  In the hustle and bustle of the fair, someone accidentally placed his shoe on the sadhu’s bare foot.\n\n  The sadhu was infuriated, and screamed, “Are you blind?  Can you not see where you are going?”  Later he repented for permitting anger to overcome him, and lamented, “Twelve years of austerities in the mountains got washed away by living one day in the city!”  The world is the arena where our renunciation gets tested.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna says that while performing one’s duties in the world, a person should slowly learn to rise above anger, greed, and des.\n\n  Instead, if one first gives up duties, it is very difficult to purify the mind; and without a pure mind, true detachment remains a distant dream.\n\n  We are all propelled to work by our nature.\n\n  Arjun was a warrior, and if he had artificially renounced his duty, to retire to the forest, his nature would make him work there as well.\n\n  He would probably gather a few tribesmen and declare himself their king.\n\n  Instead, it would be more fruitful to use his natural inclinations and talents in the service of God.\n\n  So the Lord instructs him, “Continue to fight, but make one change.\n\n  At first, you came to this battleground on the presumption of saving a kingdom.\n\n  \n\nNow, instead, simply dedicate your service unselfishly to God.\n\n  In this way, you will naturally purify the mind and achieve true renunciation from within.”\n\n  A tender and unripe fruit clings fast to the tree that bears and nourishes it.\n\n  But the same fruit, when fully ripe, severs its connection from its sustainer.\n\n  Similarly from the material existence, the karm yogi gets the experience that matures into wisdom.\n\n  Just as sound sleep is only possible for those who have worked hard, deep meditation comes to those who have purified their minds through karm-yog .",

Another word for the lotus flower is paṅkaj , which means “born from mud.”\n\n  The lotus flower grows from the mud found at the bottom of the lake, yet it rises above the water and blossoms toward the sun.\n\n  \n\nThus, the lotus flower is often used in Sanskrit literature as an example of something that is born amidst the dirt, and rises above it while retaining its beautiful purity.\n\n  Further, the lotus plant has large leaves that float atop the water surface of the lake.\n\n  Lotus leaves are used in Indian villages for plates, as they are waterproof, and liquid poured on them does not soak through, but runs off.\n\n  The beauty of the lotus leaf is that, although the lotus owes its birth, growth, and sustenance to the water, the leaf does not permit itself to be wetted.\n\n  Water poured on the lotus leaf runs off the side, due to the small hair growing on its surface.\n\n  With the help of the beautiful analogy of the lotus leaf, Shree Krishna says that just as it floats atop the surface of the lake, but does not allow itself to be wetted by the water, similarly, the karm yogis remain untouched by sin, although performing all kinds of works, because they perform their works in divine consciousness.",

Ego: When it identifies with the bodily identifications and becomes proud of things like wealth, status, beauty, and learning, we call it ahankār , or ego.\n\n These are not four separate entities.\n\n They are simply four levels of functioning of the one mind.\n\n Hence, we may refer to them all together as the mind, or as the mind-intellect, or as the mind-intellect-ego, or as the mind-intellect- chitta -ego.\n\n They all refer to the same thing.\n\n The use of the word ego here is different from its connotation in Freudian psychology.\n\n Sigmund Freud  \n***(1856 – 1939)***\n, an Austrian neurologist, proposed the first theory of psychology regarding how the mind works.\n\n According to him, the ego is the “real self” that bridges the gap between our untamed desires  \n***(Id)***\n and the value system that is learnt during childhood  \n***(Superego)***\n.\n\n Various scriptures describe the mind in one of these four ways for the purpose of explaining the concepts presented there.\n\n They are all referring to the same internal apparatus within us, which is together called antaḥ karaṇ , or the mind.\n\n \n\nFor example: The Pañchadaśhī refers to all four together as the mind, and states that it is the cause of material bondage.\n\n In the Bhagavad Gita , Shree Krishna repeatedly talks of the mind and the intellect as being two things, and emphasizes the need to surrender both to God.\n\n The Yog Darśhan, while analyzing the different elements of nature, talks of three entities: mind, intellect, and ego.\n\n Shankaracharya, while explaining the apparatus available to the soul, classifies the mind into four—mind, intellect, chitta and ego.\n\n So when Shree Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self, he means we must use the higher mind to elevate the lower mind.\n\n In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind.\n\n How this can be done has been explained in detail in verses .41 to .44 and again in verse .4.",

        "explanation": "We dissipate a large portion of our thought power and energy in combating people whom we perceive as enemies and potentially harmful to us.\n\n The Vedic scriptures say the biggest enemies—lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, .—reside in our own mind.\n\n These internal enemies are even more pernicious than the outer ones.\n\n The external demons may injure us for some time, but the demons sitting within our own mind have the ability to make us live in constant wretchedness.\n\n We all know people who had everything favorable in the world, but lived miserable lives because their own mind tormented them incessantly through depression, hatred, tension, anxiety, and stress.\n\n The Vedic philosophy lays great emphasis on the ramification of thoughts.\n\n Illness is not only caused by viruses and bacteria, but also by the negativities we harbor in the mind.\n\n If someone accidentally throws a stone at you, it may hurt for a few minutes, but by the next day, you will probably have forgotten about it.\n\n \n\nHowever, if someone says something unpleasant, it may continue to agitate your mind for years.\n\n This is the immense power of the thoughts.\n\n In the Buddhist scripture, the Dhammapada  \n***(.3)***\n, the Buddha also expresses this truth vividly: “I have been insulted! I have been hurt! I have been beaten! I have been robbed! Misery does not cease in those who harbor such thoughts.\n\n When we nourish hatred in our mind, our negative thoughts do more damage to us than the object of our hatred.\n\n It has been very sagaciously stated: “Resentment is like drinking poison and hoping that the other person dies.”\n\n The problem is that most people do not even realize that their own uncontrolled mind is causing them so much harm.\n\n Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj advises: ### mana ko mano shatru usaki sunahu jani kachhu pyare  \n***(Sadhan Bhakti Tattva)***\n[v1] “Dear spiritual aspirant, look on your uncontrolled mind as your enemy.\n\n Do not come under its sway.”\n\n \n\nHowever, the same mind has the potential of becoming our best friend, if we bring it under control of the intellect, through spiritual pract.\n\n The more powerful an entity is, the greater is the danger of its misuse, and also the greater is the scope for its utilization.\n\n Since the mind is such a powerful machine fitted into our bodies, it can work as a two-edged sword.\n\n \n\nThus, those who slide to demoniac levels do so because of their own mind while those who attain sublime heights also do so because of their purified minds.\n\n Accordingly, Franklin . Roosevelt, former President of America, expressed this very nicely: “Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.”\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna enlightens Arjun about the potential harm and benefits our mind can bestow upon us.\n\n In the following three verses, Shree Krishna describes the symptoms of one who is yog-aru?ha  \n***(advanced in Yog)***\n.",

There are only two realms in which the mind may dwell—one is the realm of Maya and the other is the realm of God.\n\n If the mind rises above the sensual dualities of the world, it can easily get absorbed in God.\n\n \n\nThus, Shree Krishna has stated that an advanced yogi’s mind becomes situated in samādhi  \n***(deep meditation)***\n upon God.",

The analogy of milk and water can help elucidate this point.\n\n If milk is poured into water, it cannot retain its undiluted identity, for water naturally mixes with it.\n\n \n\nHowever, if the milk is kept separate from water and converted into yogurt, and then the yogurt is churned to extract butter, the butter becomes immiscible.\n\n It can now challenge the water, “I will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.”\n\n Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water.\n\n In contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly.\n\n \n\nHowever, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God.\n\n Once sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, “I will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.”\n\n This instruction for seclusion has been repeated by Shree Krishna in verse 1.52: vivikt sevī laghvāśhī “Live in a secluded place; control your diet.”\n\n There is a beautiful way of practically applying this instruction without disturbing our professional and social works.\n\n In our daily schedule, we can allocate some time for sādhanā , or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances.\n\n Shutting ourselves out from the world, we should do sādhanā to purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God.\n\n If we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities.\n\n In this manner we will be able to retain the elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during the daily sādhanā in isolation from the world.",

The secret of health lies in preservation of this vital force.\n\n He who wastes this vital and precious energy cannot have physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development.”\n\n According to Ayurveda, forty drops of blood go into making one drop of semen.\n\n Those who waste their semen develop unsteady and agitated prāṇ . They lose their physical and mental energy, and weaken their memory, mind, and intellect.\n\n The practice of celibacy leads to a boost of bodily energy, clarity of intellect, gigantic will power, retentive memory, and a keen spiritual intellect.\n\n It creates a sparkle in the eyes and a luster on the cheeks.\n\n The definition of celibacy is not restricted to mere abstinence from physical indulgence.\n\n The Agni Purāṇ states that the eightfold activities related to sex must be controlled: 1) Thinking about it.\n\n 2) Talking about it.\n\n 3) Joking about it.\n\n 4) Envisioning it.\n\n 5) Desiring it.\n\n 6) Wooing to get someone interested in it.\n\n 7) Enticing someone interested in it.\n\n 8) Engaging in it.\n\n For one to be considered celibate, all these must be shunned.\n\n \n\nThus, celibacy not only requires abstinence from sexual intercourse, but also refrainment from masturbation, homosexual acts, and all other sexual practices.\n\n Further, Shree Krishna states here that the object of meditation should be God alone.\n\n This point is again reiterated in the next verse.",

        "explanation": "Varieties of techniques for meditation exist in the world.\n\n There are Zen techniques, Buddhist techniques, Tantric techniques, Taoist techniques, Vedic techniques, and so on.\n\n Each of these has many sub-branches.\n\n Amongst the followers of Hinduism itself, there are innumerable techniques being practiced.\n\n Which of these should we adopt for our personal practice? Shree Krishna makes this riddle easy to solve.\n\n He states that the object of meditation should be God himself and God alone.\n\n The aim of meditation is not merely to enhance concentration and focus, but also to purify the mind.\n\n Meditating on the breath, chakras , void, flame, . is helpful in developing focus.\n\n \n\nHowever, the purification of the mind is only possible when we fix it upon an all-pure object, which is God himself.\n\n Hence, verse 1.26 states that God is beyond the three modes of material nature, and when one fixes the mind upon him, it too rises above the three modes.\n\n \n\nThus, meditating upon the prāṇas may be called transcendental by its practitioners, but true transcendental meditation is upon God alone.\n\n \n\nNow what is the way of fixing the mind upon God? We can make all of God’s divine attributes—names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, associates—the objects of meditation.\n\n They are all non-different from God and replete with all his energies.\n\n Hence, devotees may meditate upon any of these and get the true benefit of meditating upon God.\n\n In the various bhakti traditions in India, the name of God is made the basis of contemplation.\n\n \n\nThus, the Ramayan states: brahma rām teṅ nāmu baṛa, bara dāyaka bara dāni [v10] “God’s name is bigger than God himself, in terms of its utility to the souls.”\n\n Taking the name is a very convenient way of remembering God, since it can be taken anywhere and everywhere—while walking, talking, sitting, eating, . \n\nHowever, for most sādhaks the name by itself is not sufficiently attractive for enchanting the mind.\n\n Due to sanskārs of endless lifetimes, the mind is naturally drawn to forms.\n\n Using the form of God as the basis, meditation becomes natural and easy.\n\n This is called rūp dhyān meditation.\n\n Once the mind is focused upon the form of God, we can then further enhance it by contemplating upon the virtues of God—his compassion, his beauty, his knowledge, his love, his benevolence, his grace, and so on.\n\n One can then advance in meditation by serving God in the mind.\n\n We can visualize ourselves offering foodstuffs to him, worshipping him, singing to him, massaging him, fanning him, bathing him, cooking for him, . This is called mānasī sevā  \n***(serving God in the mind)***\n.\n\n In this way, we can meditate upon the names, forms, virtues, pastimes, . of God.\n\n All these become powerful means of fulfilling Shree Krishna’s instruction to Arjun, in this verse, to keep the mind absorbed in him.\n\n At the end of the verse, Shree Krishna gives the ultimate benefits of meditation, which are liberation from Maya and the everlasting beatitude of God-realization.",

God is most powerful, and Maya is His subservient energy.\n\n The souls are always overpowered by; Maya . Then is Maya stronger than God? The individual soul is always; gripped by ignorance and misery.\n\n It needs a continuous reminder from the saints and scriptures, even about its existence and purpose.\n\n How can God, who is all-knowing, be considered a soul which is subject to ignorance? The Vedas repeatedly state that God is all-pervading in this world and beyond.\n\n Similarly, individual souls should also be able to exist anywhere at any given t.\n\n Then what about the question of going to heaven or hell after death? There is only one God, but the souls are countless.\n\n If the soul itself is God, then there should be many Gods.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the claims by non-dualistic philosophers that the soul itself is God are inconclus.\n\n The dualist philosophers’ state that the souls and God are separate.\n\n Even though it may answer some of the above questions, yet it is still an incomplete philosophy in light of what Shree Krishna states in this verse.\n\n He says that the soul is a part of jīva śhakti God’s spiritual energy.\n\n And as explained earlier, Maya, the material energy, is also His subservient.\n\n \n\nThus, God is supreme; He is the governor of both the lower material and the higher spiritual energies.\n\n \n\nNow let us see what the scriptures and various saints have said: eka-deśha-sthitasyāgnir jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā parasya brahmaṇaḥ śhaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat   \n***(Viṣhṇu Purāṇ .2.53)***\n “Just as the sun resides in one place but its sunlight pervades; the entire solar system.\n\n Similarly, there is one God, who by His infinite powers pervades the three worlds.”\n\n  Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:         jīva-tattva śhakti, kṛiṣhṇa-tattva śhaktimān gītā-viṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa    \n***(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela, .117)***\n “The soul is the energy of God, while He is the Supreme Energetic.”\n\n Once we understand and accept that the soul is a small part of God’s infinite energy, the concept of non-duality of the entire creation becomes clear.\n\n Energies can exist concurrently within the same energetic.\n\n \n\nFor example, fire contains both heat and light, which are different entities and have different properties.\n\n But they are part of the same fire which emits them.\n\n Likewise, God as the Energetic and the souls His energy can be considered one.\n\n At the same time, due to their distinct properties, both entities are different from each other.\n\n Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has encapsulated and perfectly expressed Shree Krishna’s statement in this and the previous verse: jīvu’ ‘māyā’, dui śhakti haiñ, śhaktimān bhagavān śhaktihiñ bheda abheda bhī, śhaktimān te jān    \n***(Bhakti Śhatak verse 42)***\n “The soul and Maya are both energies of God.\n\n  Hence, they are both one with God and also different from God.”\n\n Considering the unison of both; the Energetic and His energies, it is stated that God and His creation are non-different.\n\n The entire world is a veritable form of God.\n\n sarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma    \n***(Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad .1.1)***\n “All is Brahman.”\n\n īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ     \n***(Īśhopaniṣhad 1)***\n “Everything that exists in the world is God.”\n\n puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ     \n***(Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad .15)***\n “The Supreme Divine Personality is everything that exists.”\n\n According to these Vedic verses, there is only one God and nothing else.\n\n Yet, when we consider the Energetic and energy concept, there is diversity within this unity and an incredible variety.\n\n God, the souls, and matter, all three are different entities with different properties.\n\n God is Supremely sentient; He is the source of both the souls and the matter.\n\n Yet, souls are sentient, and the matter insentient.\n\n The scriptures also state the existence of three entities in creation: kṣharaṁ pradhānamamṛitākṣharaṁ haraḥ kṣharātmānāvīśhate deva ekaḥ tasyābhidhyānād yojanāt tattvabhāvad bhūyaśhchānte viśhwamāyānivṛittiḥ  \n***(Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad .10)***\n “There are three entities in existence: 1) Matter, which is perishable.\n\n  2) The individual souls who are imperishable.\n\n  3) God, who is the controller of both matter and the souls.\n\n  By meditating upon God, uniting with Him, and becoming more like Him, the soul is free from the world’s illusion.”\n\n The Vedas have expounded on both dualistic and non-dualistic concepts.\n\n Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has upheld the concepts of concurrent coherence, yet variance between the soul and God.\n\n This means God and the soul are one; yet, separate from each other.",

Water hardly has any taste of its own.\n\n Yet, other forms of matter such as solids, fires, and gases need liquids to carry their taste.\n\n Have you ever tried putting a solid food item, on your dry tongue? Do you get any taste? Only when the saliva in our mouth dissolves some part of the solid, we start getting the taste as perceived by the taste buds on our tongue.\n\n After all, who can separate the taste of water from water? That is why Shree Krishna says that he is the taste in water.\n\n It is the intrinsic property of water to carry the taste of all substances; without water, there will be no taste.\n\n In the same way, ākāśha  \n***(space)***\n acts as the vehicle for sound.\n\n Different languages form due to sound modifications.\n\n Shree Krishna says He is the origin of it all, as the sound in space is His energy.\n\n He is the syllable Om the most important sound in the Vedic mantras.\n\n The sun and the moon get their radiance from Him.\n\n Even for all the abilities that manifest in humans, He is the ultimate energy source.",

The seekers of worldly possessions.\n\n Some people are clear about what they want and take the shelter of God because they are convinced; that only God can provide what they are seeking.\n\n King Dhruv is an apt example.\n\n When Dhruv was a small boy, he felt neglected by his father, King Uttanapada.\n\n Disheartened, he went into the forest and did penance to please God.\n\n He wanted to become more powerful than his father.\n\n But as his devotion grew, he realized that God possessed the priceless jewel of divine love, and what he was seeking was like broken pieces of glass.\n\n \n\nTherefore, when pleased with his devotion, God gave him darshan, he requested the Lord to bestow upon him; self-less pure love.\n\n . Those situated in knowledge.\n\n Lastly, those souls who have understood the truth that they are tiny parts of God.\n\n Such people engage in devotion with the intent that it is their eternal duty to love and serve Him.\n\n Shree Krishna calls them the fourth kind of devotees.",

It costs more than $50, 00.”\n\n On hearing this, the man is overwhelmed and could not believe what his uncle just said.\n\n His uncle understood this and said, “It seems, you don’t believe me, I am willing to pay you $40, 000 for it.”\n\n \n\nNow, the man feels elated as if he has won a lottery.\n\n He loves the diamond-studded gold ring much more, now that he knows its real value.\n\n This example demonstrates the direct relationship between knowledge and love.\n\n When the value of the ring was perceived by the man to be less, his love for it was also lesser as his knowledge of its value increased, the love for it, and the joy he got from it also kept increasing.\n\n  The Ramayan states: jāneṅ binu na hoi paratītī, binu paratīti hoi nahiṅ prītī [v20] “Without knowledge, there cannot be faith; without faith, love cannot grow.”\n\n Similarly, if someone has acquired true knowledge and claims to know the Brahman, then love for Him comes naturally.\n\n Else their knowledge is merely theoretical if they do not feel the love that fosters devotion.\n\n Shree Krishna says that jñānīs spend several lifetimes seeking true knowledge, and when their knowledge matures into true wisdom, that the Supreme Lord is all that is; they surrender to Him.\n\n \n\nHowever, He does not say this for the jñānīs,  karmīs, haṭha-yogis,  ascetics, .

Let us look at this example of parents giving dolls to their small children.\n\n The child plays with these dolls as if they were real people and develops love and affection towards them.\n\n The parents are aware of the child’s innocence, yet they encourage this play to help the child develop the qualities of love, care, and affection towards other people.\n\n These qualities will help children become socially responsible when they grow u.\n\n Similarly, our eternal parent God is aware of our ignorance.\n\n Hence, when He finds that some souls engage in worship of the celestial gods for material gains, He helps them by steading their faith.\n\n He is aware that this experience will help in the evolution of the soul, and once they acquire true-knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the summum bonum or the highest good of everything, they will surrender to Him.",

Others who have turned to God are in the shelter of Yogmaya and liberated from Maya.",

Every day they do their worldly duties, which they call their karma , and a few minutes of yoga, ### by meditating on God.\n\n \n\nHowever, this is not the definition of karma yoga given by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n He says that in karma yoga, there are only two conditions: 1) While doing any work, the mind should always be thinking of God.\n\n 2) The remembrance of God should be constant throughout the day and not intermittent.\n\n This famous couplet by Saint Kabir beautifully expresses this concept: sumiran kī sudhi yoṅ karo, jyauṅ gāgar panihāra bolat dolat surati meṅ, kahe kabīra vichār “Remember God just as the village woman remembers the water pot on her head.\n\n She speaks with others and walks on the path, but her hand keeps holding onto the pot.”\n\n In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the benefits of practicing karma yoga .",

In its pure form, bhakti is called śhuddha bhakti . \n\nHowever, when undertaken along with ashtanga yoga, it is termed yog-miśhra bhakti or a fusion of devotion and ashtanga yoga sadhana . Shree Krishna has described yog-miśhra bhakti from verse ten to thirteen.\n\n In the practice of ashtanga yoga, the life force or prān shakti is channelized through suṣhumṇā nādi of the spinal column and then raised toward the third eye region between the eyebrows.\n\n In this verse, He says that at the time of death, one who performs this with great devotion and complete focus on the Divine Lord will definitely achieve Him.",

        "explanation": "We can meditate upon God in several ways.\n\n The Names, Forms, Leelas  \n***(Pastimes)***\n, Associates, and Abodes of God.\n\n There is no difference among all these aspects of God.\n\n \n\nTherefore, one can meditate on any one or all of them.\n\n Such meditation, where we attach our mind to the Supreme Divinity, takes our mind to the divine realm, and as a result, it purifies.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna has mentioned eight such divine aspects of God: .  Kavi: Like a poet who knows the entirety of his creation, God is omniscient.\n\n He is the seer who knows the past, present, and future, as mentioned in verse .2.\n\n .  Purāṇam:   God is the most ancient, and nothing predates Him.\n\n He is the origin of the entire material and spiritual world, but He has not originated from anything.\n\n God is without a beginning or an end.\n\n .  Anuśhāsitāram:  God is the governor or the ruler.\n\n He administers His regime through the celestial gods that He has appointed or sometimes directly.\n\n He is the creator, and everything in this universe is under His control and run by His law.\n\n .  Aṇoraṇīyān: Here God is said to exist in the subtlest or subatomic form.\n\n The soul is subtler than matter, but God is even subtler than the soul, as He is seated within every soul.\n\n .  Sarvasya Dhātā: God is the source of sustenance.\n\n Similar to an ocean that sustains the waves and its vast marine ecology.\n\n God is the support for His entire creation.\n\n .  Achintya rūpa: God exists in inconceivable forms.\n\n Our mind and intellect are material in nature, and God is divine, thus, beyond our understanding.\n\n It is only through His grace one can understand Him.\n\n He bestows His divine grace and makes our mind divine by His Yogmaya power; only then can we know Him.\n\n .  Āditya varṇa: ### Āditya is one of the names of the sun god.\n\n Here, God is said to be dazzling like the sun.\n\n .  Tamasaḥ Parastāt: Similar to the sun that eradicates darkness, God with His effulgence eliminates ignorance.\n\n On a cloudy day, the sun is not visible, but it is an optical illusion for us.\n\n The sun is where it is, unaffected by the clouds in the earth’s atmosphere.\n\n Similarly, during His Leelas or pastimes, God may seem to be covered by His material energy, Maya.\n\n \n\nHowever, He is unaffected by it.\n\n He is beyond darkness and ignorance.\n\n One may ask, why so much variety.\n\n Western scholars often get confused by the various philosophies, paths, and instructions given in the Vedic scriptures.\n\n \n\nTherefore, it is stressed in the Hindu scriptures to study them under the guidance of an able Guru.\n\n We all have different choices and natures according to our  sanskārs  \n***(tendencies)***\n from endless lifetimes.\n\n Consider this example of two people going into a cloth sho.\n\n The chances of both of them buying the same type, color, or style of clothes is very rare.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the shops keep a variety of clothes and cater to the choices and preferences of people.\n\n Similarly, the Vedic scriptures also offer various spiritual paths so that based on the level of sadhana that we may have performed in our past lives, we may choose a suitable path.\n\n \n\nHowever, they simultaneously stress on bhakti or devotion to God that ties together all these paths in one common thread.\n\n The Bhagavad Gita beautifully embraces varieties of sadhanas to cater to a large populace belonging to diverse backgrounds, upbringing, and natures.\n\n Bhakti involves focusing the mind upon God, in His various divine Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, . In its pure form, bhakti is called śhuddha bhakti . \n\nHowever, when undertaken along with ashtanga yoga, it is termed yog-miśhra bhakti or a fusion of devotion and ashtanga yoga sadhana . Shree Krishna has described yog-miśhra bhakti from verse ten to thirteen.\n\n In the practice of ashtanga yoga, the life force or prān shakti is channelized through suṣhumṇā nādi of the spinal column and then raised toward the third eye region between the eyebrows.\n\n In this verse, He says that at the time of death, one who performs this with great devotion and complete focus on the Divine Lord will definitely achieve Him.",

In some places, while referring to His formless aspect, God is said to be Akshar, which means imperishable.\n\n The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states: etasya vā akṣharasya praśhāsane gārgi sūryāchandramasau vidhṛitau tiṣhṭhataḥ     \n***(..9)***\n “Under the mighty control of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon are held on their course.”\n\n Shree Krishna mentions in this verse the word sangraheṇa,  which means “in brief.”\n\n He says that this path is very difficult to follow and not suitable for everyone.\n\n \n\nTherefore, He will not elaborate much and briefly describe this path of yog-miśhrā bhakti; that leads to attaining the formless aspect of God.\n\n It demands living a life of rigid continence and perform severe austerities.\n\n Renouncing worldly desires and practicing brahmacharya, a vow of celibacy.\n\n As was previously detailed in verse .14, the practice of celibacy conserves a person’s physical energy.\n\n This energy, when channelized through sadhana, gets transformed into spiritual energy.\n\n It also enhances the intellect and memory power of the sādhaks  \n***(spiritual aspirants)***\n and helps them comprehend the spiritual subjects better.",

        "explanation": "The Vedic scriptures state that at the beginning of creation, God first created sound.\n\n With sound, He created space and then continued with the rest of the creation process.\n\n  That primordial sound was the sacred syllable OM it is also called Pranav— the sound manifestation of the Brahman.\n\n It represents the formless aspect of the Supreme Lord, without any attributes and virtues.\n\nThe Bible also mentions this in John 1:1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n\n The sound Om pervades the entire creation; it is imperishable and infinite like God Himself.\n\n Hence, it is also called anāhat nād.\n\n In the Vedic philosophy, it is conferred as the mahā vākya , or the Great Sound Vibration of the Vedas and often attached to the beginning of the Vedic mantras, as bīja  \n***(seed or core)***\n mantra similar to hrīṁ, klīṁ,  .\n\n For proper chanting of the sacred word OM, the emphasis is on the vibrations of three letters: A… U… M… One starts by making an “A” sound from the belly, with an open mouth and throat; it then merges into a “U” created in the middle of the mouth.\n\n Finally, it ends in chanting “M” with a closed mouth.\n\n Devotees consider the word Om as the impersonal form of God.\n\n In ashtanga yoga, the Praṇav sound is considered the object of meditation.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna is describing the process of meditation with regard to the ashtanga yoga sadhana.\n\n He states that to focus the mind on God, one should chant “Óm” while practicing austerities and maintaining the vow of celibacy.\n\n \n\nHowever, the devotees who take the path of bhakti yoga prefer to meditate upon the personal Names of the Lord.\n\n They experience greater sweetness in God’s bliss when they meditate on; the personal Name and Forms of God, such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, . If you compare; the pleasure experienced by two ladies, one who is an expectant mother and one who has her new-born baby in her la.\n\n The experience is much sweeter for the new mother.\n\n Seeing her beautiful baby, she even forgets the discomfort and pain she had experienced during childbirth.\n\n The time of death is the final test of our meditation.\n\n As death is said to be intensely painful and despite the pain, those who are able to focus on God even at that last moment; attain Him.\n\n And on leaving the body, their souls reach His divine abode.\n\n \n\nHowever, to achieve such a state is very difficult; it requires continuous practice throughout one’s l.\n\n The merciful Lord Krishna shows us an easier path in the next verse.",

        "explanation": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna had explained the process of meditation as per ashtanga yoga sadhana to focus on the formless God, devoid of any attributes.\n\n \n\nHowever, this practice is not only difficult but also very bland.\n\n \n\nTherefore, He suggests an alternative method, that is, to meditate upon the personal forms of God such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, Vishnu, , including their Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates.\n\n This method is simpler and helps in keeping the mind absorbed in God and His divine form.\n\n For the first time in the Bhagavad Geeta, Shree Krishna says that He is easy to attain.\n\n But only to those yogis who are ananya-chetāḥ , which means their mind is absorbed exclusively in God.\n\n The word a-nanya Etymologically means  na anya , or “no other.”\n\n \n\nThus, exclusive devotion is the precondition for attaining God.\n\n  Throughout the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has stressed upon exclusive devotion and surrender to attain Him.\n\n ananyāśh chintayanto māṁ    .22 tam eva śharaṇaṁ gachchha    1.62 mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja    1.66 Other Vedic scriptures also reiterate the same message: mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarva-dehinām     \n***(Bhagavatam 1.1.15)***\n “Surrender to Me alone, who am the Supreme Soul of all living beings.”\n\n eka bharoso eka bala ek āsa visvāsa     \n***(Ramayan)***\n “I have only one support, one strength, one faith, one shelter, and that is Shree Ram.”\n\n anyāśhrayāṇāṁ tyāgo ’nanyatā     \n***(Nārad Bhakti Darśhan,   Sūtra  10)***\n “Reject all other shelters, and become exclusive to God.”\n\n Many spiritual seekers love God and try hard to attain Him, but their mind is also attached to the material world, their family, friends, pets, house, assets, . They contemplate upon God to purify their mind, but when they go back to their worldly relations, it gets dirty again.\n\n The worldly attachments are not only binding but also imperfect, thus cause impurity of the mind.\n\n It is like applying soap to a dirty cloth, cleaning it with pure water, and putting it back into unclean water.\n\n \n\nThus, all the effort goes fut.\n\n The ultimate aim of sadhana is to purify the mind, which can only be done by attaching the mind to God, who is all-pure.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna says that it is not just devotion; but exclusive devotion; that is necessary to attain Him.\n\n Exclusive devotion is attainable only when a purified mind is absorbed in the Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God.",

Once God-realized the soul is liberated from the cycle of life and death, it reaches the divine abode of God and remains there forever.\n\n It does not take birth in the material world again and suffer its miseries.\n\n Life in the material world from birth till death is full of suffering.\n\n The struggle starts inside the mother’s womb itself, where we hang upside down for nine months.\n\n Then we go through a painful process of taking birth and delivered into an unknown world, where we have to cry for our every need.\n\n As we grow, we need to learn to speak, eat, walk, . Then comes the turmoil of adolescence, which is a mentally challenging phase.\n\n As adults, marriage and relationships test our endurance and patience to accept and accommodate individualities.\n\n We struggle to maintain social responsibilities.\n\n Then comes old age with its gifts of sickness and disease.\n\n All through our life, we suffer from pain and miseries; induced by our own body, mind, people, or circumstances around us.\n\n Then finally, we die, which is again an extremely painful experience.\n\n But why does God put us through so much pain and misery? In God’s grand design, the purpose of these miseries is to realize that the material realm is not the permanent abode for the soul.\n\n It serves as a correction home for the souls who have forgotten God and are trapped in the material world.\n\n These sufferings and miseries help the souls develop the desire for God.\n\n Consider an example of a person who accidentally puts his hand on burning co.\n\n Immediately, due to the burning sensation and pain he experiences, he withdraws his hand.\n\n What really happened here? When the man touched hot coal, his skin started burning, and the neurons on his skin sent a message to the brain of the pain he experienced.\n\n The brain immediately sends commands to his hand muscles that remove his hand to avoid further burning and pain.\n\n \n\nTherefore, pain is a signal that something is not right and needs correction.\n\n Similarly, the pain and miseries that we experience in the material world; are stimulation for us to shun our defective consciousness.\n\n These inspire and motivate the lost souls to tread toward their ultimate goal of union with God.\n\n Those worthy souls who commit themselves in exclusive devotion attain God and reach His Divine Abode.\n\n \n\nHowever, those souls who remain engrossed in material affluence and forget God continue to rotate in the cycle of birth and death.\n\n Eventually, we get what we make ourselves worthy of and the endeavours we choose to undertake.",

The higher planes are the celestial abodes called the Swarga.\n\n The remaining seven planes that are lower than earth are the hellish abodes called  narak . These are — tal, atal, vital, sutal, talātal, rasātal, pātāl . Similar references are made by other religions as well.\n\n Islam mentions the seventh sky or the sātvāñ āsmān as the highest of the seven heavens.\n\n The Talmud, the book of Jewish law and theology, has also enumerated seven heavens, the highest being Araboth.\n\n These fourteen planes of existence are called the lokas or various worlds of our universe.\n\n The satyaḥ lok, also known as Brahma Lok, the abode of Brahma is the highest among them, and pātāl lok is the lowest.\n\n \n\nHowever, all these lokas are under the realm of Maya, the material energy of God.\n\n Hence, the dwellers of all the fourteen lokas go through the cycle of birth and death.\n\n It is because of their impermanent nature Shree Krishna in the previous verse called these worlds to be aśhāśhvatam  \n***(temporary)***\n and duḥkhālayam   \n***(full of misery)***\n.\n\n All those who are born in these lokas of material existence are subject to death someday.\n\n Even the king of the celestial gods, Indra, has to die.\n\n The Puranas mention an incident where Indra ordered the celestial architect, Vishwakarma, to construct a huge palace for himself in Swarga .  \n\nHowever, the extension plan kept on increasing, and the construction was not ending.\n\n Vishwakarma got weary and prayed to God for hel.\n\n God visited Indra and enquired, “How many Vishwakarmas have you engaged in constructing such a huge palace?” Indra was surprised by God’s question because he thought there was only one Vishwakarma.\n\n Smiling, God said to Indra, “Similar to this universe with its fourteen worlds, there are infinite universes.\n\n And each universe has an Indra and a Vishwakarma”.\n\n At the same time, Indra saw several ants walking toward him in queues.\n\n Surprised, he asked God; where all these ants were coming from.\n\n God said, “All these ants were Indras in their past lives; I have called them to meet you.”\n\n Indra was speechless.\n\n Soon after, a revered sage, Rishi Lomash, visited Indra.\n\n He was carrying a straw mat on his head and had a circle of hair on his chest.\n\n \n\nHowever, there were gaps in that circle, made by fallen hair.\n\n Indra received the sage respectfully and then asked him politely; why he was carrying a mat on his head? Also, what does the hair on his chest signify? The Rishi said, “I am blessed with a boon, to be chirāyu  \n***(endless life)***\n.\n\n The hair on my chest signifies life on this universe.\n\n Whenever the tenure of an Indra ends, one hair falls.\n\n And several such falls have caused the gaps in my chest hair.”\n\n Indra was astonished.\n\n Lomash Rishi then added, “I carry this mat on my head because during the day it protects me from sun and rain.\n\n Also, I spread it on the ground at night and slee.\n\n My disciples want to build a permanent residence for me to stay.\n\n But I think, when life itself is temporary, why build a house here?” Hearing this from someone who has the lifespan of many Indras; humbled Indra.\n\n His pride shattered, he thought to himself, “What is the point in building such a huge palace, if someday, I have to leave it all and go?” He asked Vishwakarma to stop the construction immediately and released him.\n\n It is marvellous how these stories from the Puranas and the Bhagavad Gita give an insight into; cosmology of the universe.\n\n Amazingly, these scriptures were written in ancient times, several thousand years ahead of modern astronomy.\n\n It was only in the sixteenth century that a western scientist, Nicholas Copernicus, first proposed a heliocentric theory stating that; the sun was the centre of the universe.\n\n This theory changed the previous belief that the earth was the centre of the universe.\n\n Further advancement in astronomy revealed that even the sun was not the centre of the universe.\n\n It was part of a galaxy called the milky way having countless stars like our sun, each with its own solar system.\n\n And all stars, along with their solar systems, are revolving around the epicentre of the galaxy.\n\n Further research has revealed; that similar to the Milky Way, several galaxies are gyrating in our universe.\n\n \n\nHowever, the Vedic philosophy states that the earth or the  Bhūr Lok is revolving around  Swar Lok , and the realm between them is Bhuvar Lok . The Swar Lok is again moving around Jana Lok, and the realm between these two is the Mahar Lok.\n\n Jana Lok is also not stationary and is circling the Brahma Lok  \n***(Satya Lok)***\n, and Tapa Lok is the realm between them . These are the seven higher planes, and similarly, there are seven lower planes as well.\n\n It is incredible; that our Vedic scholars had such insight into the subject over five thousand years ago.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna states that all the fourteen worlds of this universe are within the realm of His material energy Maya.\n\n Hence, the occupants are subject to the cycle of birth and death.\n\n Only those who attain God-realization get liberated from the clutches of maya.\n\n Upon death, they leave their material bodies and go to His divine abode to stay there forever.\n\n They receive divine bodies and participate in the divine Pastimes of God eternally.\n\n  They need not take birth in the material world.\n\n \n\nHowever, some saints and pious souls come back to the material world.\n\n Although liberated, they do so to engage in the divine welfare of humankind.\n\n These pious souls are the great Masters and Prophets.\n\n They descend on earth to help others get out of the bondage of maya and guide them on the path toward God-realization.",

        "explanation": "Shree Krishna begins the verse by saying ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo , meaning “I am the Supreme Ultimate Truth and the cause of all causes.”\n\n He has repeated this multiple times in the Bhagavad Gita , in verses .7, .12, 1.2-3, and 1.1.\n\n It is also strongly proclaimed in all the other scriptures.\n\n The Rig Veda states: yaṁ kāmaye taṁ taṁ ugraṁ kṛiṣhṇomi taṁ brahmāṇaṁ taṁ ṛiṣhiṁ taṁ sumedhsam  \n***(1.12.5)***\n[v4] “I make the persons I love exceedingly mighty; I make them men or women; I make them wise sages; I make a soul empowered for the seat of Brahma.”\n\n The wise who comprehend this truth develop firm faith and worship him with loving devotion.\n\n \n\nThus, Shree Krishna is the Supreme Lord of both the material and spiritual creations.\n\n \n\nHowever, administering creation is not the primary work of God.\n\n Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states: swayaṁ bhagavānera karma nahe bhāra-haraṇa  \n***(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela .8)***\n[v5] “Shree Krishna does not directly involve himself in the works of creating, maintaining, and dissolving the material universes.”\n\n Shree Krishna’s primary activity is to engage in eternal loving pastimes with the liberated souls in Golok, his divine abode.\n\n For the purpose of material creation, he expands himself as Karanodakshayi Vishnu, who is also called Maha Vishnu.\n\n Maha Vishnu is thus the form of the Lord that presides over the material realm, consisting of infinite material universes.\n\n Maha Vishnu is also known as Pratham Puruṣh  \n***(first expansion of God in the material realm)***\n.\n\n He resides in the divine water of the kāraṇ  \n***(causal)***\n ocean and manifests innumerable material universes from the pores of his body.\n\n He then expands himself to reside at the bottom of each universe as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, who is called Dwitīya Puruṣh  \n***(second expansion of God in the material realm)***\n.\n\n From Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Brahma is born.\n\n He guides the process of creation—creating the various gross and subtle elements of the universe, the laws of nature, the galaxies and planetary systems, the forms of life residing in them, . Hence, Brahma is often referred to as the creator of the universe.\n\n \n\nHowever, he is actually the secondary creator.\n\n Garbhodakashayi Vishnu further expands himself as Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, and resides at the top of each universe, in a place called Kṣhīra Sāgar . Kshirodakshayi Vishnu is also known as Tṛitīya Puruṣh  \n***(third expansion of God in the material realm)***\n.\n\n He resides at the top of the universe, but he also resides as the Supreme soul, in the heart of all living beings in the universe, noting their karmas, keeping an account, and giving the results at the appropriate t.\n\n He is thus known as the maintainer of the universe.\n\n All the three forms of Lord Vishnu mentioned here are non-different from Shree Krishna.\n\n \n\nThus, in this verse, Shree Krishna states that all spiritual and material creation emanate from him.\n\n Shree Krishna is also called the Avatārī  \n***(the source of all the Avatārs )***\n.\n\n The Śhrīmad Bhāgvatam states: ete chāṁśha kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛiṣhṇas tu bhagavān svayam  \n***(..28)***\n[v6] “All the forms of God are the expansions, or the expansions of the expansions of Shree Krishna, who is the primordial form of God.”\n\n And so, the secondary creator Brahma prays to Shree Krishna: yasyaikaniśhvasita kālamathāvalambya jīvanti lomavilajā jagadaṇḍanāthāḥ viṣhṇurmahān saihayasya kalāviśheṣho govindamādi puruṣhaṁ tamahaṁ bhajāmi  \n***(Brahma Samhitā .48)***\n[v7] “Infinite universes—each having Shankar, Brahma, and Vishnu—manifest from the pores of Maha Vishnu’s body when he breathes in, and again dissolve into him when he breathes out.\n\n I worship Shree Krishna of whom Maha Vishnu is an expansion.”\n\n Shree Krishna now goes on to explain how devotees worship him.",

This has previously been described in the commentary on verse .1.\n\n Having described how his devotees worship him, Shree Krishna now explains how he responds to their devotional activities.",

Shree Krishna reveals here how knowledge of God can be gained.\n\n He says that it is God who bestows divine knowledge upon the soul, and the fortunate soul who receives his grace is able to know him.\n\n The Yajur Veda states: tasya no rāsva tasya no dhehī [v12] “Without bathing oneself in the nectar emanating from the lotus feet of God, no one can know him.”\n\n \n\nThus, true knowledge of God is not a result of intellectual gymnastics but a consequence of divine grace.\n\n Shree Krishna also mentions in this verse that he does not choose the recipient of his grace in a whimsical manner.\n\n Rather, he bestows it upon those who unite their minds with him in devotion.\n\n He next talks about what happens when we receive divine grace.",

At present, our senses, mind, and intellect are all material, while God is div.\n\n Hence, we are unable to see him, hear him, know him, or be united with him.\n\n When God bestows his grace, he confers his divine Yogmaya energy upon the soul.\n\n It is also called śhuddha sattva  \n***(divine mode of goodness)***\n, which is distinct from the sattva guṇa  \n***(mode of goodness)***\n of Maya.\n\n When we receive that śhuddha sattva energy, our sense, mind, and intellect become div.\n\n To put it simply, by his grace, God bestows his divine senses, divine mind, and divine intellect to the soul.\n\n Equipped with these divine instruments, the soul is able to see God, hear God, know God, and be united with God.\n\n Hence, the Vedānt Darśhan states: viśheṣhānugrahaśh cha  \n***(..38)***\n[v13] “Only by God’s grace does one gain divine knowledge.”\n\n In this way, the torchlight that Shree Krishna refers to is his divine power.\n\n By the light of God’s divine power the darkness of the material energy is dispelled.",

The answer is that Arjun had asked Shree Krishna how he should think of him, and these glories have been described in response to Arjun’s question.\n\n The mind is naturally drawn to specialties, and thus, the Lord has revealed these specialties amongst his powers.\n\n Whenever we see a special splendor manifesting anywhere, if we look on it as God’s glory, then our mind will naturally be transported to him.\n\n In the larger scheme of things, however, since God’s glories are in all things big and small, one can think of the whole world as providing innumerable examples for enhancing our devotion.\n\n A paint company in India would advertise, “Whenever you see colors think of us.”\n\n In this case, Shree Krishna’s statement is tantamount to saying, “Wherever you see a manifestation of glory, think of me.”\n\n",

You have been with us all the wh.”\n\n Ganesh said, “Father, you are God.\n\n The entire universe exists within you.\n\n If I have gone around you, I have gone around the entire universe.”\n\n Lord Shiv had to agree that his son Ganesh was very smart, and indeed he had won the competition.\n\n Just as Lord Shiv was standing in one place, and yet the entire world was contained in him, similarly, Shree Krishna announces to Arjun that the entire creation, consisting of unlimited material universes, is held within a fraction of his being.",

        "explanation": "Seeing the cosmic form of God changed the nature of Arjun’s relationship with Shree Krishna.\n\n Earlier, he had looked upon him as an intimate friend and interacted in a manner befitting a close associate.\n\n He was aware in the back of his head that Shree Krishna was God, but the love overflowing in his heart would make him forget the almighty aspect of Shree Krishna’s personality.\n\n All he would remember was that he loved his friend Shree Krishna more than anything in the world.\n\n That is the nature of love.\n\n It absorbs the mind so deeply that the devotee forgets the formal position of his Beloved Lord.\n\n And if formality is retained, then love is unable to manifest in its fullness.\n\n \n\nFor example, a wife loves her husband deeply.\n\n Though he may be the governor of the state, the wife only looks upon him as her husband, and that is how she is able to interact intimately with him.\n\n If she keeps this knowledge in her head that her husband is the governor, then each time he comes by, she will be inclined to stand on her feet and pay a more ceremonial respect for him.\n\n So, the knowledge of the official position of the beloved gets immersed in the loving sentiments.\n\n The same phenomenon takes place in devotion to God.\n\n The cowherds of Braj merely viewed Shree Krishna as their bosom buddy.\n\n Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj describes their pastimes with Shree Krishna very sweetly: dekho dekho rī, gwāla bālana yārī rijhavata khela jitāya sakhana ko, ghoṛā bani bani banawārī  \n***(Prem Ras Madirā, Rasiyā Mādhuri, Pada 7)***\n[v7] “Look at the sweetness of the loving interactions between Shree Krishna and his cowherd friends! They play games together, and when Shree Krishna loses the game, he becomes a horse by sitting on all fours and his friend rides on his back.”\n\n If the cowherd friends remembered that Shree Krishna was God, they would never have the gumption to do such a thing.\n\n And the Lord too relishes the intimacy of such interactions with his devotees in which they relate with him as a dear friend.\n\n Shree Krishna enacted the famous Goverdhan leela pastime upon the earth, in which he lifted the Goverdhan Hill on the little finger of his left hand, to protect the residents of the land of Braj from the rain caused by Indra, the king of heaven and the celestial god of rain.\n\n \n\nHowever, Krishna’s little cowherd associates were not impressed.\n\n In their eyes, Krishna was merely a loveable friend, and so they did not believe he could lift the hill.\n\n Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states in continuation to the verse above: nakha dhāryo goverdhana-giri jaba, sakhana kahyo hama giridhārī  \n***(Prem Ras Madirā, Rasiyā Mādhurī, Pada 7)***\n[v8] “When Shree Krishna lifted the Goverdhan Hill, his cowherd friends applied their sticks to the bottom of the hill, thinking that they were the actual lifters of the hill.”\n\n At the end, Indra accepted defeat and came seated on his white elephant.\n\n He apologized for having sent the torrential rain, without realizing Shree Krishna’s supreme position.\n\n \n\nNow, when the cowherd boys saw Indra, the King of heaven, coming and offering obeisance to their friend Krishna, they realized that Krishna is God.\n\n So, they began looking at him fearfully from a distance.\n\n Seeing their devotional sentiment change from friendship to awe and reverence, Shree Krishna lamented, “That loving exchange we were enjoying has vanished.\n\n They are now thinking I am God.”\n\n So by his Yogmaya power, he made them forget the significance of what they had seen, and they again felt that Shree Krishna was nothing more than their friend.\n\n Arjun was also a devotee of Shree Krishna in sakhya bhāv . He was used to relating to Shree Krishna as his friend.\n\n That is why he had agreed to having Shree Krishna as his chariot driver.\n\n If his devotion had been motivated by the fact that Shree Krishna was the Supreme Lord of all creation, Arjun would never have allowed him to do such a demeaning serv.\n\n But now, seeing his infinite splendor and inconceivable opulences, his fraternal sentiment toward Shree Krishna was replaced by fear.",

Aiśhwarya bhakti is that where the devotee is motivated to engage in devotion by contemplating upon the almighty aspect of God.\n\n The dominant sentiment in aiśhwarya bhakti is of awe and reverence.\n\n In such devotion, the feeling of remoteness from God and the need for maintaining propriety of conduct is always perceived.\n\n Examples of aiśhwarya bhakti are the residents of Dwaraka and the residents of Ayodhya, who worshipped Shree Krishna and Lord Ram respectively as their kings.\n\n Ordinary citizens are highly respectful and obedient toward their king, although they never feel intimate with him.\n\n Mādhurya bhakti is that where the devotee feels an intimate personal relationship with God.\n\n The dominant sentiment in such devotion is “Shree Krishna is mine and I am his.”\n\n Examples of mādhurya bhakti are the cowherd boys of Vrindavan who loved Krishna as their friend, Yashoda and Nand baba, who loved Krishna as their child, and the gopīs who loved him as their beloved.\n\n Mādhurya ### bhakti is infinitely sweeter than aiśhwarya bhakti . Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states: sabai sarasa rasa dwārikā, mathurā aru braja māhiñ madhura, madhuratara, madhuratama, rasa brajarasa sama nāhiñ  \n***(Bhakti Śhatak verse 70)***\n[v22] “The divine bliss of God is immensely sweet in all his forms.\n\n Yet, there is a gradation in it—the bliss of his Dwaraka pastimes is sweet, the bliss of his Mathura pastimes is sweeter, and the bliss of his Braj pastimes is the sweetest.”\n\n In Mādhurya bhakti , forgetting the almightiness of God, devotees establish four kinds of relationships with Shree Krishna: Dāsya bhāv —Shree Krishna is our Master and I am his servant.\n\n The devotion of Shree Krishna’s personal servants, such as Raktak, Patrak, . was in dāsya bhāv . The sentiment that God is our Father or Mother is a variation of dāsya bhāv and is included in it.\n\n Sakhya bhāv —Shree Krishna is our Friend and I am his intimate companion.\n\n The devotion of the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, such as Shreedama, Madhumangal, Dhansukh, Mansukh, . was in sakhya bhāv . Vātsalya bhāv —Shree Krishna is our Child and I am his parent.\n\n The devotion of Yashoda and Nand baba was in vātsalya bhāv . Mādhurya bhāv —Shree Krishna is our Beloved and I am his lover.\n\n The devotion of the gopīs of Vrindavan was in mādhurya bhāv . Arjun is a sakhya bhāv devotee and relishes a fraternal relationship with the Lord.\n\n On seeing the universal form of God, Arjun experienced tremendous awe and reverence, and yet he longed for the sweetness of sakhya bhāv that he was used to savoring.\n\n Hence, he prays to Shree Krishna to hide the almighty form that he is now seeing and again show his human form.",

        "explanation": "Having explained that worship of the personal form is better, Shree Krishna now begins to explain how to worship Him.\n\n  He asks Arjun to do two things—fix the mind on God and also surrender the intellect to Him.\n\n  The function of the mind is to create desires, attractions, and aversions.\n\n  The function of the intellect is to think, analyze, and discriminate.\n\n The importance of the mind has been repeatedly stated in the Vedic scriptures:  chetaḥ khalvasya bandhāya muktaye chātmano matam guṇeṣhu saktaṁ bandhāya rataṁ vā puṁsi muktaye  \n***(Bhagavatam .2.15)***\n “Captivity in Maya and liberation from it is determined by the mind.\n\n  If it is attached to the world, one is in bondage, and if the mind is detached from the world, one gets liberated.”\n\n  mana eva manuṣhyāṇāṁ kāraṇaṁ bandha mokṣhayoḥ     \n***(Pañchadaśhī)***\n “Bondage and liberation are decided by the state of the mind.”\n\n  Mere physical devotion is not sufficient; we must absorb the mind in thinking of God.\n\n  The reason is that without the engagement of the mind, mere sensory activity is of no value.\n\n  \n\nFor example, we hear a sermon with our ears, but if the mind wanders off, we will not know what was said.\n\n  The words will fall on the ears but they will not register.\n\n  This shows that without engaging the mind the work of the senses does not count.\n\n  On the other hand, the mind is such an instrument that in it all the senses reside in the subtle form.\n\n  \n\nThus, even without the actual sensory activity the mind experiences the perceptions of sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.\n\n  \n\nFor example, at night when we sleep our senses are inact.\n\n  Yet while dreaming, our mind experiences the objects of all the senses.\n\n  This proves that the mind has the capacity to experience all perceptions even without the gross senses.\n\n  \n\nTherefore, while noting our karmas, God gives importance to the mental works and not the physical works of the senses.\n\n  Even beyond the mind is the intellect.\n\n  We can only fix the mind upon God when we surrender our intellect to Him.\n\n  In material pursuits as well, when we face situations beyond the capability of our intellect, we take guidance from a person with superior intellect.\n\n  \n\nFor example, we visit a doctor when we are sick.\n\n  We have no knowledge of medical science ourselves, and so we follow the advice of a qualified medical doctor.\n\n  The doctor checks our symptoms, looks at our medical reports, makes a diagnosis, and then prescribes the medicines.\n\n  We surrender our intellect and take the medicines according to the doctor’s prescription.\n\n  Similarly, if we are involved in a legal case, we take the help of a lawyer.\n\n  The lawyer instructs us how to handle the interrogation by the opposing lawyer.\n\n  Having no knowledge of law ourselves, we surrender our intellect and simply do as the lawyer says.\n\n  In the same way, at present our intellect is subject to many defects.\n\n  Akrur, who went to get Shree Krishna from Vrindavan to Mathura,  described these imperfections of the intellect in the Bhagavatam  \n***(1.4.25)***\n:  anityānātma duḥkheṣhu viparyaya matirhyaham   Akrur said: “Our intellect is strapped with wrong knowledge.\n\n  Though we are eternal souls, we think of ourselves to be the perishable body.\n\n  Although all the objects of the world are perishable, we think they will always remain with us, and hence, we busily accumulate them day and night.\n\n  And though the pursuit of sensual pleasures only results in misery in the long run, we still chase them in the hope that we will find happiness.”\n\n  The above three defects of the intellect are called viparyaya , or reversals of knowledge under material illusion.\n\n  The gravity of our problem is further aggravated because our intellect is habituated to this kind of defective thinking from innumerable previous lifetimes.\n\n  If we run our lives in accordance with the directions of our intellect, we will definitely not make much progress on the divine path.\n\n  \n\nThus, if we wish to achieve spiritual success by attaching the mind to God, we must surrender our intellect to Him and follow His directions.\n\n  Surrendering the intellect means to think in accordance with the knowledge received from God via the medium of the scriptures and the bonafide Guru.\n\n  The characteristics of a surrendered intellect are described in verse 1.6.",

        "explanation": "The instruction to practice to remember God is also often easier said than done.\n\n  The mind is made from the material energy Maya and it naturally runs toward the material objects of the world, while taking it toward God requires conscious and determined effort.\n\n  We may hear the instruction that we should think of God, and we may desire to implement it, but when we get absorbed in our work, God slips out of the mind.\n\n  So what should those people do who find it difficult to practice the remembrance of God at all times of the day?  Shree Krishna answers this question in the above verse.\n\n Those who cannot constantly remember God should practice to simply work for Him.\n\n  In whatever work they perform, they should cultivate the intention that they are doing it for the pleasure of the Lord, as stated previously in verses .27 and .2.\n\n  In household life, a major portion of one’s time goes in the maintenance of the family.\n\n  One should keep doing the same work, but change the internal consciousness.\n\n  Rather than doing it out of bodily attachment for them, one should develop the consciousness that the family members are all children of God, and one has a responsibility to take care of them for His pleasure.\n\n  One has to continue earning one’s living, but again, a modification can be done in the consciousness with which one works.\n\n  Rather than thinking that it is for the purpose of earning money for worldly enjoyment, one can think, “I wish to maintain my family and myself with the earnings to enable us all to engage in devotion.\n\n  And whatever I can save, I will donate in the service of God.”\n\n  Similarly, the bodily processes of eating, sleeping, bathing, . cannot be given u.\n\n  But here again, we can develop divine consciousness, “I need to keep my body healthy so that I can serve God with it.\n\n  That is why I will carefully do the tasks required for its maintenance.”\n\n   When we practice working for the pleasure of God, we will naturally stop engaging in selfish activities and move toward those that are more in the nature of devotional serv.\n\n  In this way, by performing all actions for the exclusive satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna, our mind will become steady and we will soon be able to focus upon Him.\n\n  Then, gradually love for God will manifest within the heart, and we will gain success in constantly thinking of Him.",

        "explanation": "Knowledge is appealing to the intellect when it is expressed with precision and clarity, and is substantiated with sound logic.\n\n  Further, for it to be accepted as infallible, it must be confirmed on the basis of infallible authority.\n\n  The reference for validating spiritual knowledge is the Vedas.\n\n  Vedas :  These are not just the name of some books; they are the eternal knowledge of God.\n\n  Whenever God creates the world, He manifests the Vedas for the benefit of the souls.\n\n  The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad  \n***(..11)***\n states:  niḥśhvasitamasya vedāḥ  “The Vedas manifested from the breath of God.”\n\n  They were first revealed in the heart of the first-born Brahma.\n\n  From there, they came down through the oral tradition, and hence, another name for them is Śhruti , or “knowledge received through the ear.”\n\n  At the beginning of the age of Kali , Ved Vyas, who was himself a descension of God, put down the Vedas in the form of a book, and divided the one body of knowledge into four portions—Ṛig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, and Atharva Veda.\n\n  Hence, he got the name Ved Vyās , or “one who divided the Vedas.”\n\n  The distinction must be borne in mind that Ved Vyas is never referred to as the composer of the Vedas but merely the one who divided them.\n\n  Hence, the Vedas are also called apauruṣheya , which means “not created by any person.”\n\n  They are respected as the infallible authority for spiritual knowledge.\n\n  bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhaviṣhyaṁ cha sarvaṁ vedāt prasidhyati    \n***(Manu Smṛiti 1.97)***\n “Any spiritual principle must be validated on the authority of the Vedas.”\n\n  To elaborate this knowledge of the Vedas, many sages wrote texts and these traditionally became included in the gamut of the Vedic scriptures because they conform to the authority of the Vedas.\n\n  Some of the important Vedic scriptures are listed below.\n\n Itihās :  These are historical texts, and are two in number, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.\n\n  They describe the history related to two important descensions of God.\n\n  The Ramayan was written by Sage Valmiki, and describes the Leelas , or divine Pastimes, of Lord Ram.\n\n  Amazingly, it was written by Valmiki before Shree Ram actually displayed His Leelas .  The great poet Sage was empowered with divine vision, by which he could see the Pastimes Lord Ram would enact on descending in the world.\n\n  He thus put them down in 24, 000 most beautifully composed Sanskrit verses of the Ramayan.\n\n  These verses also contain lessons on ideal behavior in various social roles, such as son, brother, wife, king, and married couples.\n\n  The Ramayan has also been written in many regional languages of India, thereby increasing its popularity amongst the people.\n\n  The most famous amongst these is the Hindi Ramayan, Ramcharit Manas, written by a great devotee of Lord Ram, Saint Tulsidas.\n\n The Mahabharat was written by Sage Ved Vyas.\n\n  It contains 100, 000 verses and is considered the longest poem in the world.\n\n  The divine Leelas of Lord Krishna are the central theme of the Mahabharat.\n\n  It is full of wisdom and guidance related to duties in all stages of human life, and devotion to God.\n\n  The Bhagavad Gita is a portion of the Mahabharat.\n\n  It is the most popular Hindu scripture, since it contains the essence of spiritual knowledge, so beautifully described by Lord Krishna Himself.\n\n  It has been translated in many different languages of the world.\n\n  Innumerable commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n Puranas :  There are eighteen Puranas, written by Sage Ved Vyas.\n\n  Together, they contain 400, 000 verses.\n\n  These describe the divine Pastimes of the various forms of God and His devotees.\n\n  The Puranas are also full of philosophic knowledge.\n\n  They discuss the creation of the universe, its annihilation and recreation, the history of humankind, the genealogy of the celestial gods and the holy sages.\n\n  The most important amongst them is the Bhāgavat Purāṇ , or the Shreemad Bhagavatam.\n\n  It was the last scripture written by Sage Ved Vyas.\n\n  In it, he mentions that in this scripture, he is going to reveal the highest dharma of pure selfless love for God.\n\n  Philosophically, the Shreemad Bhagavatam begins where the Bhagavad Gita ends.\n\n Ṣhaḍ-darśhan :  These come next in importance amongst the Vedic scriptures.\n\n  Six sages wrote six scriptures highlighting particular aspects of Hindu philosophy.\n\n  These became known as the Ṣhaḍ-darśhan, or six philosophic works.\n\n  They are: . Mīmānsā:  Written by Maharishi  \n***(Sage)***\n Jaimini, it describes ritualistic duties and ceremonies.\n\n . Vedānt Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Ved Vyas, it discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth.\n\n . Nyāya Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Gautam, it develops a system of logic for understanding life and the Absolute Truth.\n\n . Vaiśheṣhik Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Kanad, it analyses cosmology and creation from the perspective of its various elements.\n\n . Yog Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Patañjali, it describes an eightfold path to union with God, beginning with physical postures.\n\n . Sānkhya Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Kapil, it describes the evolution of the Universe from prakṛiti , the primordial form of the material energy.\n\n Apart from these mentioned above, there are hundreds of other scriptures in the Hindu tradition.\n\n  It would be impossible to describe them all here.\n\n  Let it suffice to say that the Vedic scriptures are a vast treasure house of divine knowledge revealed by God and the saints for the eternal welfare of all humankind.\n\n  Amongst these scriptural texts, the Brahma Sūtra  \n***(Vedānt Darśhan)***\n is considered as the last word on the topic of the distinction between the soul, the material body, and God.\n\n  Hence, Shree Krishna particularly mentions it in the above verse.\n\n  “Ved” refers to the Vedas, and “ant” means “the conclusion.”\n\n  Consequently, “Vedānt” means “the conclusion of Vedic knowledge.”\n\n  Although, the Vedānt Darśhan was written by Sage Ved Vyas, many great scholars accepted it as the reference authority for philosophical dissertation and wrote commentaries on it to establish their unique philosophic viewpoint regarding the soul and God.\n\n  Jagadguru Shankaracharya’s commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan is called Śhārīrak Bhāṣhya, which lays the foundation for the advait-vād tradition of philosophy.\n\n  Many of his followers, such as Vachaspati and Padmapada have elaborated upon his commentary.\n\n  Jagadguru Nimbarkarcharya wrote the Vedānt Pārijāta Saurabh, which explains the dwait-advait-vād school of thought.\n\n  Jagadguru Ramanujacharya’s commentary is called Śhrī Bhāṣhya, which lays the basis for the viśhiṣhṭ-advait-vād system of philosophy.\n\n  Jagadguru Madhvacharya’s commentary is called Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣhyam, which is the foundation for the dwait-vād school of thought.\n\n  Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya wrote Aṇu Bhāṣhya, in which he established the śhuddhadvait-vād system of philosophy.\n\n  Apart from these, some of the other well-known commentators have been Bhat Bhaskar, Yadav Prakash, Keshav, Nilakanth, Vijnanabhikshu, and Baladev Vidyabhushan.\n\n Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, himself a Vedic scholar par excellence, did not write any commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan.\n\n  He took the view that the writer of the Vedānt, Sage Ved Vyas himself, declared that his final scripture the Shreemad Bhagavatam is its perfect commentary: arthoyaṁ brahmasūtrāṇaṁ sarvopaniṣhadāmapi “The Shreemad Bhagavatam reveals the meaning and the essence of the Vedānt Darśhan and all the Upanishads.”\n\n  Hence, out of respect for Ved Vyas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not deem it fit to write another commentary on the scripture.",

remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness.\n\n  Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.\n\n   If the intellect is undecided about what is more important—material enhancement or spiritual wealth—then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.\n\n  But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.\n\n  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.\n\n  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.\n\n  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.\n\n  I will also have to fall sick one day.”\n\n  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.\n\n  This means that I will also become old one day.”\n\n  After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, “This is also a part of existence.\n\n  It means that I too will have to die one day.”\n\n  The Buddha’s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.\n\n  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.\n\n Non-attachment.\n\n  It means dispassion toward the world.\n\n  We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.\n\n  The sādhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.\n\n  Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.\n\n   These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.\n\n  In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “m.”\n\n  \n\nThus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.\n\n  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.\n\n  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.\n\n  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.\n\n  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.\n\n  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.\n\n  Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in l.\n\n   Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.\n\n  That is l.\n\n  To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.\n\n  We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life’s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.\n\n  Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.\n\n  Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.\n\n  But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.\n\n  Life is about engaging in the desirable.\n\n  The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.\n\n  \n\nTherefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.\n\n Inclination for solitary places.\n\n  Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.\n\n  They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.\n\n  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.\n\n  Aversion for mundane society.\n\n   The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.\n\n  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.\n\n  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.\n\n Constancy in spiritual knowledge.\n\n  To theoretically know something is not enough.\n\n  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.\n\n  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.\n\n  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.\n\n  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.\n\n  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.\n\n Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.\n\n  Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.\n\n  \n\nHowever, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.\n\n  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.\n\n All the

The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge.\n\n And yet, the knowledge they possess often makes them proud, and they begin to feel that there can be no truth beyond the grasp of their intellect.\n\n \n\nThus, they find it difficult to develop faith toward either the scriptures or the God-realized Saints.\n\n In the mode of passion, the souls are impelled toward intense activity.\n\n Their attachment to the world and preference for pleasure, prestige, wealth, and bodily comforts, propels them to work hard in the world for achieving these goals, which they consider to be the most important in l.\n\n Rajo guṇa increases the attraction between man and woman, and generates kām  \n***(lust)***\n.\n\n To satiate that lust, man and woman enter into the relationship of marriage and have a home.\n\n The upkeep of the home creates the need for wealth, so they begin to work hard for economic development.\n\n They engage in intense activity, but each action creates karmas, which further bind them in material existence.\n\n The mode of ignorance clouds the intellect of the living being.\n\n The desire for happiness now manifests in perverse manners.\n\n \n\nFor example, everyone knows that cigarette smoking is injurious to health.\n\n Every cigarette pack carries a warning to that extent issued by the government authorities.\n\n Cigarette smokers read this, and yet do not refrain from smoking.\n\n This happens because the intellect loses its discriminative power and does not hesitate to inflict self-injury to get the pleasure of smoking.\n\n As someone jokingly said, “A cigarette is a pipe with a fire at one end and a fool at the other.”\n\n That is the influence of tamo guṇa , which binds the soul in the darkness of ignorance.",

This can be compared to students applying for college admission after completing school.\n\n There are many colleges in the country.\n\n Those students with good qualifying criteria at the school level gain admission in the best colleges, while those with poor grades and other scores are admitted to the worst ones.\n\n Likewise, the Bhāgavatam says: sattve pralīnāḥ svar yānti nara-lokaṁ rajo-layāḥ tamo-layās tu nirayaṁ yānti mām eva nirguṇāḥ  \n***(1.2.22)***\n[v2] “Those who are in sattva guṇa reach the higher celestial abodes; those who are in rajo guṇa return to the earth planet; and those who are in tamo guṇa go to the nether worlds; while those who are transcendental to the three modes attain Me.”\n\n",

If we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the three guṇas , it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect.\n\n \n\nHowever, if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends the guṇas and becomes div.\n\n Those who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, through bhakti , with God and the Guru.\n\n This enables them to transcend the three guṇas , and attain the divine nature of God.\n\n This is further elaborated in verse 1.2.",

They help elevate us from tamo guṇa and rajo guṇa to sattva guṇa . \n\nHowever, to reach sattva guṇa is not enough; it is also a form of bondage.\n\n The mode of goodness can be equated to being fettered with chains of gold.\n\n Our goal lies even beyond it—to get out of the prison house of material existence.\n\n Shree Krishna explains that when we transcend the three modes, then Maya no longer binds the living being.\n\n \n\nThus, the soul gets released from the cycle of life and death and attains immortality.\n\n Factually, the soul is always immort.\n\n \n\nHowever, its identification with the material body makes it suffer the illusion of birth and death.\n\n This illusory experience is against the eternal nature of the soul, which seeks release from it.\n\n Hence, the material illusion is naturally discomforting to our inner being and, from within, we all seek the taste of immortality.",

        "explanation": "In this verse, Shree Krishna has explained the requisites for complete surrender to the Supreme Lord, who is at the base of this enigmatic aśhvatth tree.\n\n  The first step is to give up all pride, which is due to ignorance.\n\n The embodied souls have an illusion that they are the governors of all the material wealth that they have acquired, and continue accumulating more.\n\n Their minds are blinded by pride borne by ignorance, they think that all this is for their enjoyment, and would continue giving them happiness.\n\n A soul in such a state does not comprehend God as the owner of all.\n\n \n\nThus, cannot surrender unto his will.\n\n Only through proper knowledge of God can this false notion of being the enjoyer be removed.\n\n It is necessary to realize that God alone is the owner of all the material energy and it needs to be used for his service only.\n\n He is the master of the entire creation, and the souls are his eternal servants.\n\n The souls should give up the attitude of pride and develop an attitude of selfless service to the Lord.\n\n This can be achieved by understanding the true nature of the self as the eternal servant, eliminating material attachments that pull us towards the world and away from him.\n\n The Padma Purāṇ states: dāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamam śhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatānprabhurīśhwaraḥ “The Supreme Lord Narayan is the controller and the Lord of the world.\n\n  All moving and non-moving beings and entities in this creation are His servants.”\n\n  Hence, as our desire to serve God increases, the illusion of being the enjoyer of prakṛiti  \n***(material world)***\n gets gradually eliminated and the heart is cleansed.\n\n  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj emphasizes this above everything else, as the most powerful means for purifying the heart: sau bātana kī bāta ika, dharu muralīdhara dhyāna, baṛhavahu sevā-vāsanā, yaha sau jñānana jñāna.\n\n  \n***(Bhakti Śhatak, verse 74)***\n  “Out of a hundred advice for purification, the most important is this.\n\n  Let your mind be absorbed in the divine flute-player, Shree Krishna, and keep increasing your desire to serve Him.\n\n  This counsel is more important than a hundred such gems of knowledge.”\n\n  But what happens once our etheric hearts are cleansed and become perfectly situated in the loving service of the Lord? In this verse, Shree Krishna says that all those perfected souls enter his spiritual realm and stay there forever.\n\n Once the state of God-realization is achieved, the material realm serves no purpose, the soul is free from the cycle of life and death.\n\n It now stays in God’s divine Abode along with other perfected, God-realized souls.\n\n The material realm is only one-fourth, while the spiritual realm is three-fourths of the entire creation.\n\n As a city prison only occupies a small part of a large city, similarly, the material realm is a very small part of God’s vast creation.\n\n The Vedas state: pādo ’sya viśhwā bhūtāni, tripādasya amṛitam divi     \n***(Puruṣh Sūktam Mantra 3)***\n “This temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of creation.\n\n  The other three parts are the eternal Abode of God that is beyond the phenomenon of life and death.”\n\n In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the nature of the eternal Abode.",

To understand this, we must first look at what are the different forms in which God manifests.\n\n There are mainly two forms: Swānśh :  All the direct forms of God, who are His integrated parts and not different from Lord Shree Krishna are called swānśh.\n\n They are also known as His Avatars such as Shree Ram, Narshingh Bhagavan, Varaha, Matsya, . Vibhinnānśh :  All the souls of existence come under this category; they are not directly His parts.\n\n These take form from His material energy or jīva śhakti . Shree Krishna had previously explained this in Verse .5 “But beyond the material energy, O mighty-armed Arjun, there is another superior energy of M.\n\n  It is the embodied souls who are the basis of life in this world.”\n\n These vibhinnānśh souls are further divided into three kinds:  Nitya Siddha :  The liberated souls, who have always resided in the divine realm of God since eternity and participate in His divine Pastimes.\n\n Sādhan Siddha :  Those souls from the material world, who practiced sādhanā and attained the Supreme Lord.\n\n  And now they reside in the divine realm for the rest of eternity.\n\n Nitya Baddha :  The embodied souls who have been trapped in the material realm since eternity.\n\n  Due to their material existence, these souls are dis-illusioned by their five senses and the mind.\n\n They are struggling in samsara; the cycle of birth and death.\n\n  The Kaṭhopaniṣhad states: parāñchi khāni vyatṛiṇat swayambhūḥ   \n***(..1)***\n “The creator, Brahma, has made the senses such that they are turned outward toward the world.”\n\n  \n\nTherefore, Shree \n\nKrishna said for the vibhinnānśh nitya baddha parts, “Bound by their material nature, these souls are struggling with the six senses including the mind.”\n\n In the next verse, He explains when a soul moves from one body to another upon death, what happens to the mind and the senses.",

Even when the material body dies, the soul continues to carry the mind along with the experiences of its past lifetimes from its former body to the new one.\n\n That explicates why people who are born blind can still dream, probably based on their experiences from past lives.\n\n Dreams are considered to be a visual representation of what we see or think during waking hours.\n\n It might be in a distorted or rambled form, which gets connected in our mind when we slee.\n\n \n\nFor example, someone saw a bird flying and thought, “How wonderful will it be to fly like a bird!” Sometime later, he dreams that he is flying in his human body itself.\n\n Yet, a blind person who has not seen anything from birth dreams, this can only be due to all the impressions that are stored in the subconscious mind, which it carries with it from past lifetimes.\n\n In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains what the soul does with the mind and senses it takes with it when it departs from its present body.",

With the help of the mind and the senses, it can enjoy taste, smell, touch, feel or hear sounds.\n\n Even though the mind and senses are lifeless, due to the consciousness of the soul they become lifel.\n\n This helps them to experience pleasure and pain from their thoughts, situations, persons, and objects of the senses.\n\n Then the embodied soul identifies the same experiences of the mind and the senses as its own because of the ego.\n\n The trouble here is, that the happiness experienced through the mind and the senses is material, but the soul is div.\n\n Hence, regardless of the amount, the soul can never be satisfied with such material pleasures.\n\n It is restless and continuously keeps searching for that ultimate source of happiness.\n\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson an American philosopher very beautifully said, “We grant that human life is mean.\n\n  But how did we find out that it is mean?  What is the ground of this uneasiness, of this old discontent?  What is this universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim?” Another famous philosopher, Meister Eckhart has written: “There is something in the soul which is above the living being, divine and simple.\n\n This light is only satisfied with the supra essential essence.”\n\n  The divine bliss, which is both eternal and infinite; that the uncontended soul is continuously searching for; can only be attained from God.\n\n Those who realize that the mind and the senses are the cause of bondage, and the only way to break free is to turn these instruments of senses towards God, progresses on the path of devotion.\n\n Saint Tulsidas, the author of Ramayana in Hindi  \n***(Awadhi)***\n is an excellent example.\n\n As a young lad, he was madly in love with his w.\n\n Once she went for a few days to her parents’ house, which was in a nearby village across a stream.\n\n At night, the weather was bad, but Tulsidas was very restless and eager to meet her.\n\n He decided to go and meet her right away.\n\n It was very dark and raining, so no boatman was willing to take him across the stream.\n\n Then he saw something floating nearby, thinking that it was a log, he clung to it and swam across.\n\n  When he reached her house, it was late, he was hesitant to wake the entire household.\n\n His wife’s room was on the second floor, he thought of calling out to her, but saw a rope hanging from her window.\n\n He caught that and went up to her room.\n\n She was astonished to see him there and enquired how he managed to come that late at night, in such terrible weather.\n\n He pointed at the window, but when they looked out of the window, both were shocked.\n\n There was no rope it was a snake, and what Tulsidas assumed to be a log, was in fact, a floating dead body.\n\n His desire for his wife was so intense that it had blinded his mind.\n\n She was furious and said to him, “You desire me, a body made of flesh and blood.\n\n If you would have such an intense desire for God, you would attain him and be free from the cycle of life and death.”\n\n Her words had a life-changing effect on Tulsidas.\n\n He left home, renounced a householders’ life and took up devotion.\n\n By detaching himself from the material pleasures and engaging them towards devotion to God, he went on to become a great saint and poet.\n\n He later wrote: kāmihi nāri piāri jimi lobhihi priya jimi dāma, timi raghunātha nirantara priya lāgahu mohi rāma  \n***(Ramayan)***\n “As a lustful man desires a beautiful woman, and as an avaricious person desires wealth, may my mind and senses constantly desire Lord Ram.”\n\n",

        "explanation": "So far in this chapter, Shree Krishna has detailed that His opulence is the source of all the magnificence in nature, and in creating the visible universe he does not deplete Himself.\n\n In this verse, He has called Himself  Puruṣhottam, the Divine Supreme Person who transcends over the material world, which includes both  kṣhar the  perishable and  akṣhar  the imperishable divine souls.\n\n    Does that mean the  Puruṣhottam  He has referred to and Lord Shree Krishna Himself are two different entities? To eliminate any such doubts, in this verse, while referring to Himself Shree Krishna has used the term  aham  \n***(I)***\n, which is first person singular.\n\n He also said that the Vedas and the Smritis have described Him similarly: kṛiṣhṇa eva paro devas taṁ dhyāyet taṁ rasayet taṁ yajet taṁ bhajed  \n***(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad)***\n “Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord.\n\n Meditate upon Him, relish the bliss of His devotion, worship Him, and serve Him.”\n\n  yo ’sau paraṁ brahma gopālaḥ  \n***(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad)***\n  “Gopal  \n***(Lord Krishna)***\n is the Supreme Being.”\n\n Then the question arises, who are Lord Ram, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and all the other Gods and Goddesses? They are all different manifestations of the same  Bhagavān , the Supreme Divine Personality and should not be considered separate.",

Here, in this verse lies the answer.\n\n Shree Krishna says those who know Him as the Supreme Divine Personality and worship him as Bhagavān truly have complete knowledge of Him.\n\n Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj in his book Bhakti Śhatak has given a detailed explanation of why Bhagavān realization is the highest.\n\n He has quoted the same verse ..11 of the Shreemad Bhagavatam and said: tīna rūp śhrī kṛiṣhṇa ko, vedavyās batāya, brahma aura paramātmā, aru bhagavān kahāya.\n\n     \n***(Bhakti Śhatak verse 21)***\n “Ved Vyas has declared that the Supreme Lord manifests in three ways—Brahman , Paramātmā, and Bhagavān .”  Then he goes on to describe these three manifestations of the Absolute Truth.\n\n sarvaśhakti sampann ho, śhakti vikāsa na hoya, sat chit ānanda rūp jo, brahma kahāve soya.\n\n     \n***(Bhakti Śhatak verse 22)***\n “As Brahman, the infinite energies of God are all latent.\n\n  He merely displays eternal knowledge and bliss.”\n\n sarvaśhakti sanyukta ho, nāma rūp guṇa hoya, līlā parikara rahit ho, paramātmā hai soya.\n\n     \n***(Bhakti Śhatak verse 23)***\n  “As Paramātmā , God displays His Form, Name, and Virtues.\n\n  But He does not engage in Leelas , nor does He have associates.”\n\n sarvaśhakti prākaṭya ho, līlā vividha prakāra, viharata parikara sang jo, tehi bhagavān pukāra.\n\n     \n***(Bhakti Śhatak verse 24)***\n “The aspect of God in which He manifests all His energies and engages in various loving Pastimes with His devotees is called Bhagavān .” Through these verses, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has explicated that; while in His manifestation as Brahman and Paramātmā God does not reveal himself completely; but as Bhagavān, He manifests himself with all his Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates.\n\n  This complete realization of the Supreme Entity has also been explained earlier in verse 1.2, with the example of a train.\n\n \n\nThus, those who seek God as Bhagavān , the Supreme Divine Personality can truly acquire complete knowledge of Him.",

        "explanation": "Dharma consists of codes of conduct that are conducive to one’s purification and the general welfare of all living beings.\n\n Adharma consists of prohibited actions that lead to degradation and cause harm to society.\n\n The demoniac nature is devoid of faith in the knowledge and wisdom of the scriptures.\n\n Hence, those under its sway are confused about what is right and wrong action.\n\n A typical example of this is the present trend in western philosophy.\n\n Having evolved through various schools of thought after the Renaissance, such as Age of Enlightenment, Humanism, Empiricism, Communism, Existentialism, and Skepticism, the present era in western philosophy is labeled as “Post-modernism.”\n\n The prevalent view of Post-modernist thought is that there is no absolute truth.\n\n Multitudes have rejected the possibility that such a thing as absolute truth could exist.\n\n “All is relative” has become the slogan of the post-modernist era of philosophy.\n\n We often hear phrases like “that may be true for you, but it’s not true for me.”\n\n Truth is seen as a personal preference or perception that cannot extend beyond a person’s individual boundaries.\n\n This viewpoint has a big bearing on the subject of ethics, which deals with the question of right and wrong behavior.\n\n If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then there is no ultimate moral rightness or wrongness about anything.\n\n Then, people are justified in saying, “It may be right for you but that does not mean it is right for me.”\n\n Such an idea is very appealing to many, but if taken to its logical extreme it proves absurd and disastrous.\n\n \n\nFor example, what if it is right for someone to ignore traffic lights, even when they are red? That person will put the life of others at risk by doing what he believes is right.\n\n What if it is considered right by someone to go on a suicide-bombing mission in a heavily populated civilian area amongst people he sees as enemies? He may be fully convinced that what he is doing is correct.\n\n But does that make it right in any sense of the word? If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then no-one can really say “he should do that” or “she shouldn’t do that.”\n\n All one can say is, “A lot of people do not feel good about this action.”\n\n According to the relativist viewpoint, one might respond, “That may be true for you, but it is certainly not true for us.”\n\n These can be the ruinous ethical consequences of disregarding the belief of an Absolute Truth.\n\n Shree Krishna states that the demoniac nature is confused about what is right and what is wrong, and thus, neither purity, nor truth, nor right conduct is found in them.\n\n In the following verse, he goes on to describe the predominant views of such people.",

        "explanation": "There are two ways of refraining from immoral behavior.\n\n The first is to refrain from unrighteousness through the exercise of will-power.\n\n The second way is to abstain from sin due to fear of God.\n\n People who have the ability to abstain from sinning merely by will-power are very few.\n\n The majority of people desist from doing wrong due to the fear of punishment.\n\n \n\nFor example, it is observed on highways that the moment a police car is spotted, people immediately slow down to the permissible speed limit, but when they perceive there is no danger of being caught, they do not hesitate in exceeding the speed limit.\n\n \n\nThus, if we believe in God, out of fear of him we will refrain from immoral behavior.\n\n Instead, if we do not believe in God, all his laws will still be applicable to us, and we will suffer the consequences of wrong-behavior.\n\n Those with demoniac natures do not wish to accept this imposition of authority and regulation of behavior that is a necessary corollary of belief in God.\n\n Instead, they prefer to subscribe to the view that there is no God and the world has no basis for moral order.\n\n They propagate ideas such as the “Big Bang Theory, ” which postulates that the world was created by an accidental explosion that took place at time zero of creation, and thus there is no God who sustains the world.\n\n Such theories permit them to engage in sensual gratification without scruples or fear of consequences.\n\n Amongst the various forms of sensual gratification, sexual indulgence is the most intense.\n\n This is because the material realm is like a distorted reflection of the spiritual realm.\n\n In the spiritual realm, divine love is the basis of the activities of the liberated souls and their interactions with God.\n\n In the material realm, its distorted reflection, lust, dominates the consciousness of materially conditioned souls, particularly those under the mode of passion.\n\n \n\nThus, the demoniac-minded see engagement in lustful activities as the purpose of human l.",

Charles . Townes, Nobel Prize winner in Physics, expressed this very nicely: “Science itself requires faith.\n\n We don’t know if our logic is correct.\n\n I don’t know if you are there.\n\n You don’t know if I am here.\n\n We may just be imagining all this.\n\n I have a faith that the world is what it seems like, and thus I believe you are there.\n\n I can’t prove it from any fundamental point of view… Yet I have to accept a certain framework in which to operate.\n\n The idea that ‘religion is faith’ and ‘science is knowledge, ’ I think, is quite wrong.\n\n We scientists believe in the existence of the external world and the validity of our own logic.\n\n We feel quite comfortable about it.\n\n Nevertheless these are acts of faith.\n\n We can’t prove them.”\n\n Whether one is a material scientist, a social scientist, or a spiritual scientist, one cannot avoid the leap of faith required in the acceptance of knowledge.\n\n Shree Krishna now explains the reason why different people choose to place their faith in different places.",

These are the weeds that choke out the manifestation of divine grace within our hearts.\n\n People imagine that their thoughts are secret and have no external consequences because they dwell within the mind, away from the sight of others.\n\n They do not realize that thoughts not only forge their inner character but also their external personality.\n\n That is why we look upon someone and say, “He seems like a very simple and trustworthy person.”\n\n For another person, we say, “She seems to be very cunning and deceitful.\n\n Stay away from her.”\n\n In each case, it was the thoughts people harbored that sculpted their appearance.\n\n Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “There is full confession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations, in the grasp of the hands.\n\n Our sin bedaubs us, mars all the good impressions.\n\n Men do not know why they do not trust us.\n\n The vice glasses the eyes, demeans the cheek, pinches the nose, and writes, ‘O fool, fool!’ on the forehead of a king.”\n\n Another powerful saying linking thoughts to character states: “Watch your thoughts, for they become words.\n\n Watch your words, for they become actions.\n\n Watch your actions, for they become habits.\n\n Watch your habits, for they become character.\n\n Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.”\n\n It is important to realize that we harm ourselves with every negative thought that we harbor in our mind.\n\n At the same time, we uplift ourselves with every positive thought that we dwell upon.\n\n Henry Van Dyke expressed this very vividly, in his poem “Thoughts are things.”\n\n I hold it true that thoughts are things; They’re endowed with bodies and breath and wings That which we call our secret thought Speeds forth to earth’s remotest spot, Leaving its blessings or its woes, Like tracks behind as it goes.\n\n We build our future, thought by thought.\n\n For good or ill, yet know it not, Choose, then, thy destiny and wait, For love brings love, and hate brings hate.\n\n Each thought we dwell upon has consequences, and thought-by-thought, we forge our destiny.\n\n For this reason, to veer the mind from negative emotions and make it dwell upon the positive sentiments is considered austerity of the mind.",

The Epicureans of Greece  \n***(third century BC)***\n believed that to “eat, drink, and be merry” was right action.\n\n . More refined was the philosophy of Hobbs of England  \n***(1588 – 1679)***\n and Helvetius of France  \n***(1715 – 1771)***\n.\n\n They said that if everyone becomes selfish and does not think of others, there will be chaos in the world.\n\n So they recommended that along with personal sense gratification we should also care for others.\n\n \n\nFor example, if the husband is sick, the wife should take care of him; and if the wife is sick, the husband should take care of her.\n\n In the case where helping others conflicts with the self-interest, they advised that self-interest should be given the priority.\n\n . Joseph Butler’s  \n***(1692 – 1752)***\n philosophy went beyond this.\n\n He said that the idea of service to others after catering to our own self-interest was wrong.\n\n Helping others is a natural human virtue.\n\n Even a lioness feeds her cubs while remaining hungry herself.\n\n So, service to others must always take priority.\n\n \n\nHowever, Butler’s concept of service was limited to the alleviation of material suffering; for example, if a person is hungry, he should be fed.\n\n But this does not really solve problems because after six hours the person is hungry again.\n\n . After Butler came Jeremy Bentham  \n***(1748 – 1832)***\n and John Stuart Mill  \n***(1806 – 1873)***\n.\n\n They recommended the utilitarian principle of doing what is best for the majority.\n\n They suggested following the majority opinion for determining proper behavior.\n\n But if the majority is wrong or misguided then this philosophy falls through, for even a thousand ignorant people together cannot match the quality of thought of one learned person.\n\n Other philosophers recommended following the dictates of the conscience.\n\n They suggested that it is the best guide in determining proper behavior.\n\n \n\nHowever, the problem is that everyone’s conscience guides differently.\n\n Even in one family, two children have different moral values and conscience.\n\n Besides, even one person’s conscience changes over t.\n\n If a murderer is asked whether he feels bad on killing people, he replies, “Initially I would feel bad, but later it became as trivial as killing mosquitoes.\n\n I feel no remorse.”\n\n Regarding proper action, the Mahabharat states: ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet śhrutiḥ smṛitiḥ sadāchāraḥ svasya cha priyamātmanaḥ  \n***(.1.17)***\n[v18] “If you do not like it when others behave with you in a certain way, then do not behave with them in that way either.\n\n But always verify that your behavior is in accordance with the scriptures.”\n\n Conduct yourself with others as you desire them to behave with you.\n\n The Bible also says, “Do to others as you would have them do to you.”\n\n  \n***(Luke .31)***\n[v19] Here, Shree Krishna declares, in a similar way that action in the mode of goodness is doing one’s duty in accordance with the scriptures.\n\n He further adds that such work should be without attachment or aversion, and without desire to enjoy the results.",

Here, Shree Krishna explains that people have different natures, according to the guṇas that constitute their personality, and thus different professional duties are suitable for them.\n\n The system of varṇāśhram dharma was a scientific organization of society according to svabhāva-prabhavair guṇaiḥ  \n***(work based on one’s nature and guṇas )***\n.\n\n In this system of categorization, there were four āśhrams  \n***(stages in life)***\n and four varṇas  \n***(occupational categories)***\n.\n\n The stages in life were: 1) Brahmacharya āśhram  \n***(student life)***\n, which lasted from birth till the age of 2.\n\n 2) Gṛihastha āśhram  \n***(household life)***\n, which was regular married life, from the age of 25 till 5.\n\n 3) Vānaprastha āśhram  \n***(semi-renounced life)***\n, which was from the age of 50 till 7.\n\n In this stage, one continued to live with the family but practiced renunciation.\n\n 4) Sanyās āśhram  \n***(renounced order)***\n, which was from the age of 75 onward, where one gave up all household duties and resided in a holy place, absorbing the mind in God.\n\n The four varṇas  \n***(occupational categories)***\n were Brahmin  \n***(priestly class)***\n, Kshatriya  \n***(warrior and administrative class)***\n, Vaishya  \n***(mercantile and farming class)***\n, and Shudra  \n***(worker class)***\n.\n\n The varṇas were not considered higher or lower amongst themselves.\n\n Since the center of society was God, everyone worked according to their intrinsic qualities to sustain themselves and society, and make their life a success by progressing toward God-realization.\n\n \n\nThus, in the varṇāśhram system, there was unity in diversity.\n\n Diversity is inherent in nature and can never be removed.\n\n We have various limbs in our body, and they all perform different functions.\n\n Expecting all limbs to perform the same functions is fut.\n\n Seeing them all as different is not a sign of ignorance, but factual knowledge of their utilities.\n\n Similarly, the variety amidst human beings cannot be ignored.\n\n Even in communist countries where equality is the foremost principle, there are party leaders who formulate ideologies; there is the military that wields guns and protects the nation; there are farmers who cultivate the land; and there are industrial workers who do mechanical jobs.\n\n The four classes of occupations exist there as well, despite all attempts to equal.\n\n The varṇāśhram system recognized the diversity in human natures and scientifically prescribed duties and occupations matching people’s natures.\n\n \n\nHowever, with the passage of time the varṇāśhram system deteriorated, and the basis of the varṇas changed from one’s nature to one’s birth.\n\n The children of Brahmins started calling themselves as Brahmins, irrespective of whether they possessed the corresponding qualities or not.\n\n Also, the concept of upper and lower castes got propagated and the upper castes began looking down upon the lower castes.\n\n When the system grew rigid and birth-based, it became dysfunction.\n\n This was a social defect that crept in with time, and was not the original intention of the Varṇāśhram system.\n\n In the next few verses, according to the original categorization of the system, Shree Krishna maps the guṇas of people with their natural qualities of work.",

You do not know my powers.”\n\n Reading his mind, the woman replied, “Do not look at me with such anger.\n\n I am not a crow to be burnt by your glance.”\n\n The monk was shocked, and asked how she knew about the incident? The housewife said she did not practice any austerities, but did her duties with devotion and dedication.\n\n By virtue of it, she had been illumined and was able to read his mind.\n\n She then asked him to meet a righteous butcher who lived in the town of Mithila, and said that he would answer his questions on dharma . The sanyāsī overcame his initial hesitation of speaking to a lowly butcher, and went to Mithila.\n\n The righteous butcher then explained to him that we all have our respective swa-dharma , based upon our past karmas and competence.\n\n But if we discharge our natural duty, renouncing the desire for personal gain and rising above the fleeting happiness and misery coming our way, we will purify ourselves and graduate to the next class of dharma . In this manner, by doing the prescribed duties and not running away from them, the soul gradually evolves from its present gross consciousness to divine consciousness.\n\n The lecture the butcher delivered is known as the Vyadha Gita of the Mahabharat.\n\n This message is particularly applicable to Arjun because he wanted to run away from his dharma , thinking it is painful and miserable.\n\n In this verse, Shree Krishna instructs him that by doing his prescribed duty in proper consciousness he will be worshipping the Supreme, and will easily attain perfection.",

        "explanation": "People sometimes recoil from their duty because they see a defect in it.\n\n Here, Shree Krishna states that no work is free from defect, just as fire naturally has smoke on top of it.\n\n \n\nFor example, we cannot breathe without killing millions of microbes.\n\n If we cultivate the land, we destroy innumerable microorganisms.\n\n If we succeed against competition in business, we deprive others of wealth.\n\n When we eat, we deprive another of food.\n\n Since swa-dharma entails activity, it cannot be devoid of defects.\n\n But the benefits of the swa-dharma far outweigh its defects.\n\n And the foremost benefit is that it provides a comfortable and natural path for one’s purification and elevation.\n\n In his book, Making a Life, Making a Living, Mark Albion, who was a professor at the Harvard Business School, cites a study in which the careers of 1, 500 business school graduates were tracked from 1960 to 198.\n\n From the beginning, graduates were grouped in two categories.\n\n In category A were those who said they wanted to make money first, so that they could do what they really wanted to do later, after they had taken care of their financial concerns.\n\n Eighty-three percent fell in category . In category B were those who pursued their interests first, sure that money would eventually follow.\n\n Seventeen percent came in category . After 20 years, there were 101 millionaires.\n\n One person was from category A  \n***(who wanted to make money first)***\n, and one hundred from category B  \n***(who pursued their interest first)***\n.\n\n The overwhelming majority of the people who became wealthy did so thanks to the work they found profoundly absorbing.\n\n Mark Albion concludes that for most people there is a difference between work and play.\n\n But if they do what they love, then work becomes play, and they never have to work for another day in their l.\n\n That is what Shree Krishna is asking Arjun to do—not to abandon the work that is best suited to his nature, even if it has defects in it, rather to work according to his natural propensity.\n\n But for work to be elevating, it must be done in the proper consciousness, described in the next verse.",

        "explanation": "In this last chapter, Shree Krishna repeats many of the principles he has already explained.\n\n In the beginning of this chapter, he explained to Arjun that merely running away from the responsibilities of life is not sanyās , nor is it renunciation.\n\n \n\nNow he describes the state of actionlessness, or naiṣhkarmya-siddhi . This state can be reached even amidst the flow of the world by detaching ourselves from events and outcomes, and simply focusing on doing our duty.\n\n This is just as water flowing under a bridge enters from one side and flows out from the other.\n\n The bridge is neither the recipient of the water nor its distributor; it remains unaffected by its flow.\n\n Likewise, the karm yogis do their duty, but keep the mind unaffected by the stream of events.\n\n They do not neglect putting in their best efforts in doing their duty, as an act of worship to God, but they leave the final outcome in his hands, and are thus contented and undisturbed with whatever happens.\n\n Here’s a simple story to illustrate this point.\n\n A man had two daughters; the first was married to a farmer and the second was married to a brick kiln owner.\n\n One day, the father rang up the first daughter and inquired how she was doing.\n\n She replied, “Father, we are going through economic hardships.\n\n Please pray to God for us that we may have plentiful rains in the coming months.”\n\n He then rang up the second daughter, and she requested, “Father, we are low on funds.\n\n Please request God not to send rains this year, so that we may have lots of sunshine and a good production of bricks.”\n\n The father heard the opposite requests of his daughters, and thought, “God alone knows what is best.\n\n Let him do what he feels is best.”\n\n Such acceptance of the will of God brings detachment from outcomes, despite being immersed in the incessant stream of events in the world.",

Ved Vyas has declared the same in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam: ātmārāmāśh cha munayo nirgranthā apy urukrame kurvanty ahaitukīṁ bhaktim ittham-bhūta-guṇo hariḥ  \n***(..10)***\n[v24] “Even those who are ātmārām  \n***(rejoicing in the self)***\n, established in self-knowledge, and liberated from material bonds, such perfected souls desire to possess bhakti toward God.\n\n The super-excellent qualities of God are such that they attract even the liberated souls.”\n\n There are many examples of renowned jñānīs who had attained self-knowledge and were situated in the realization of the formless Brahman . \n\nHowever, when they got a glimpse of the transcendental divine qualities of God, they naturally got drawn toward bhakti . Instances of such jñānīs from each of the four yugas are given here.\n\n The greatest jñanīs in Satya Yuga were the four sons of Brahma—Sanat Kumar, Sanatan Kumar, Sanak Kumar, and Sanandan Kumar.\n\n They were self-realized from birth, and their minds were always absorbed in the formless Brahman . These four brothers once visited Vaikunth, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu.\n\n There, the fragrance from the tulsī  \n***(holy basil)***\n leaves at the lotus feet of the Lord entered their nostrils, causing a thrill of ecstasy in their hearts.\n\n Immediately, their meditation on the attributeless Brahman ended, and they were immersed in the bliss of divine love for Lord Vishnu.\n\n They beseeched him for a boon: kāmaṁ bhavaḥ sva-vṛijinair nirayeṣhu naḥ stāch cheto ’livad yadi nu te padayo rameta   \n***(Bhāgavatam .1.49)***\n[v25] “O Lord, we do not even mind if you send us to hell, so long as our mind gets the opportunity to drink the divine love bliss that emanates from your lotus feet.”\n\n Just imagine, even after having realized the formless Brahman , these foremost jñānīs were willing to reside in hell for the sake of relishing the bliss of the personal form of God.\n\n Let us now move on to Tretā Yuga . The topmost jñānī in this age was King Janak.\n\n He was the father of Sita, the eternal consort of Lord Ram.\n\n He was also known as Videha , one who was beyond all perceptions of the body.\n\n His mind would remain ever absorbed in the formless Brahman . One day, however, Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, along with Lord Ram and Lakshman.\n\n What took place then is described in the Ramayan: inhani bilokata ati anurāgā, barabasa brahmasukhahi mana tyāgā [v26] “On seeing Lord Ram, King Janak became detached from the bliss of the formless Brahman , and deeply attached to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.”\n\n In this manner, the greatest jñānī of the age of Tretā came to the path of bhakti .” The topmost jñānī in the age of Dwāpar was Shukadev, the son of Sage Ved Vyas.\n\n The Puranas describe him as being so elevated that he remained in his mother’s womb for twelve years, thinking that if he came into the world, the material energy, Maya, would overpower him.\n\n Finally, Sage Narad came and spoke to him through his mother’s ear, reassuring him that nothing would happen and he should emerge from the womb.\n\n Finally, he emerged, and by his yogic power, he expanded his body to that of a twelve-year old and renounced home to live in the forest.\n\n There, he soon reached the highest state of samādhi . Years went by, and one day Ved Vyas’s students were cutting wood in the forest, when they saw him in samādhi . They went back and told the Sage about it.\n\n He told them to recite a verse in Shukadev’s ears, describing the beauty of the personal form of Lord Krishna: barhāpīḍaṁ naṭa-vara-vapuḥ karṇayoḥ karṇikāraṁ bibhrad vāsaḥ kanaka-kapiśhaṁ vaijayantīṁ cha mālām randhrān veṇor adhara-sudhayāpūrayan gopa-vṛindair vṛindāraṇyaṁ sva-pada-ramaṇaṁ prāviśhad gīta-kīrtiḥ  \n***(Bhāgavatam 1.2.5)***\n[v27] “Shree Krishna is adorned with a peacock feathered crown upon his head, and exhibits his form as the greatest dancer.\n\n His ears are decorated with blue karṇikā flowers.\n\n His shawl is the color of brilliant gold.\n\n He wears a garland made of vaijayantī beads.\n\n He fills the holes of his flute with the nectar from his lips.\n\n His praises are sung as he enters Vrindavan, surrounded by his cowherd friends, and the marks of his footprints beautify the earth.”\n\n Shukadev was absorbed in the formless Brahman when the verse entered his ears.\n\n Suddenly, the object of his meditation transformed into the enchanting form of Lord Krishna.\n\n He felt so deeply attracted to the bliss of the personal form of God, that he left his samādhi and went back to his father, Ved Vyas.\n\n From him, he heard the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, which is full of the sweetness of bhakti . Later, on the banks of the Ganges, he related it to King Parikshit, grandson of Arjun.\n\n In this manner, the greatest jñānī of the age of Dwāpar got drawn to the path of bhakti . Finally, we come to Kali Yuga . Jagadguru Shankaracharya is widely considered the greatest jñānī of this age.\n\n He is widely acclaimed as the propagator of advaita vāda  \n***(non-dualism)***\n, in which he stated that there is only one entity in existence, which is the nirguṇa  \n***(without qualities)***\n, nirviśheṣha  \n***(attributeless)***\n, nirākār  \n***(formless)***\n Brahman . \n\nHowever, many people are unaware that from the age of twenty until he left his body at the age of thirty-two, he wrote hundreds of verses in praise of Lord Krishna, Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Mother Durga, . He also visited the four dhāms  \n***(centers of spirituality in the four corners of India)***\n, and worshipped deities of the personal forms of God in all of them.\n\n In Prabodh Sudhākar, he writes: kāmyopāsanayārthayantyanudinaṁ kiñchitphalaṁ swepsitam kechit swargamathāpavargamapare yogādiyajñādibhiḥ asmākaṁ yadunandanāṅghriyugaladhyānāvadhānārthinām kiṁ lokena damena kiṁ nṛipatinā swargāpavargaiśhcha kim   \n***(verse 250)***\n[v28] “Those who perform righteous actions for the attainment of celestial abodes may do so.\n\n Those who desire liberation via the path of jñāna or aṣhṭāṅg yog may pursue that go.\n\n As for me, I want nothing of these two paths.\n\n I wish only to engross myself in the nectar of Shree Krishna’s lotus feet.\n\n I do not desire either worldly or heavenly pleasures, nor do I desire liberation.\n\n I am a rasik who relishes the bliss of divine love.”\n\n The fact is that Shankaracharya was a great devotee of Lord Krishna.\n\n What he taught in his bhāṣhyas  \n***(commentaries)***\n was the need of the times.\n\n When he appeared upon the earth, Buddhism was prevailing all over India.\n\n In such an environment, to reestablish the faith of the Buddhists in the Vedas, he sidelined devotion while writing his bhāṣhyas . But later, in the numerous stutis  \n***(praises)***\n he wrote for the personal forms of God, he revealed his inner devotion.\n\n Shankaracharya was thus an example in the age of Kali , of someone who had reached the highest realization of jñāna , and who then did devotion.",

        "explanation": "In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that through bhakti the devotees enter into full awareness of him.\n\n Equipped with it, they see everything in its connection with God.\n\n They see their body, mind, and intellect as the energies of God; they see their material possessions as the property of God; they see all living beings as parts and parcels of God; and they see themselves as his tiny servants.\n\n In that divine consciousness, they do not give up work, rather they renounce the pride of being the doers and enjoyers of work.\n\n They see all work as devotional service to the Supreme, and they depend upon him for its performance.\n\n Then, upon leaving their body, they go to the divine abode of God.\n\n Just as the material realm is made from the material energy, the divine realm is made from the spiritual energy.\n\n Hence, it is free from the defects of material nature, and is perfect in every way.\n\n It is sat-chit-ānand , full of eternality, knowledge, and bliss.\n\n Regarding his divine realm, Shree Krishna had said in verse 1.6: “Neither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of M.\n\n Having gone There, one does not return to this material world again.”\n\n The various forms of God have their own personal abodes in the spiritual realm, where they engage in eternal loving pastimes with their devotees.\n\n Those who perfect their selfless loving service toward him go to the abode of their worshipped form of God.\n\n \n\nThus, the devotees of Lord Krishna go to Golok; those of Lord Vishnu go to Vaikunth; the devotees of Lord Ram go to Saket; the worshippers of Lord Shiv go to Shiv Lok; those of Mother Durga go to Devi Lok, . The devotees, who reach these divine abodes, having attained him, participate in his divine pastimes that are imbued with the perfection of the spiritual energy.",

        "explanation": "Yog means “union, ” and buddhi yog means “having the intellect united with God.”\n\n This union of the intellect occurs when it is firmly convinced that everything in existence has emanated from God, is connected to him, and is meant for his satisfaction.\n\n Let us understand the position of the intellect in our internal system.\n\n Within our body is the subtle antaḥ karaṇ , which we also refer to colloquially as the heart, or the etheric heart.\n\n It has four aspects to it.\n\n When it creates thoughts, we call it mana , or mind.\n\n When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi , or intellect.\n\n When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta . When it identifies with the attributes of the body and becomes proud, we call it ahankār , or ego.\n\n In this internal machinery, the position of the intellect is dominant.\n\n It makes decision, while the mind desires in accordance with those decisions, and the chitta gets attached to the objects of affection.\n\n \n\nFor example, if the intellect decides that security is the most important thing in the world, then the mind always yearns for security in l.\n\n Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect.\n\n That is why anger flows downward.\n\n The CEO shouts at the director.\n\n The director does not shout back, because the intellect realizes that it will cost him the job; he vents his anger at the manager.\n\n The manager controls himself, despite feeling vexed with the director; but finds release by shouting at the foreman.\n\n The foreman takes it all out at the worker.\n\n The worker purges his frustration on the w.\n\n The wife shouts at the children.\n\n In each case, the intellect decides where it is dangerous to get angry, and where it does not have repercussions.\n\n The example illustrates that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind.\n\n \n\nThus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction.\n\n This is what Shree Krishna means by buddhi yog —developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work and all things are meant for the pleasure of God.\n\n For such a person of resolute intellect, the chitta easily gets attached to God.",

        "explanation": "Being dependent upon God, the soul must also depend upon his grace to get out of its present predicament and attain the ultimate go.\n\n Self-effort will never suffice for this.\n\n But if God bestows his grace, he will grant his divine knowledge and divine bliss upon the soul, and release it from the bondage of the material energy.\n\n Shree Krishna emphasizes that by his grace, one will attain eternal beatitude and the imperishable abode.\n\n \n\nHowever, to receive that grace, the soul must qualify itself by surrendering to God.\n\n Even a worldly father will not hand over all his precious possessions to his child until the child becomes responsible enough to utilize them properly.\n\n Similarly, the grace of God is not a whimsical act; he has perfectly rational rules on the basis of which he bestows it.\n\n If God does not follow rules while bestowing grace, people’s faith in him will break.\n\n Let us say, for example, that there is a father who has two sons.\n\n He instructs both of them to work hard in the paddy field as it is the cultivation season.\n\n One son toils and sweats it out in the blazing son all day long.\n\n In the night when he returns, the father says, “Well done my son.\n\n You are obedient, hard-working, and loy.\n\n Here is your reward.\n\n Take $500 and do what you like with it.”\n\n The second son does nothing—he lies in bed all day long, sleeping, drinking, smoking, and abusing his father.\n\n At night, suppose the father says, “Never mind, after all you are also my son.\n\n Here is $500; go and enjoy yourself with it.”\n\n The result of this will be that the first son’s motivation to work hard will be smothered.\n\n He will say, “If this is my father’s reward system, then why should I work? I will also do nothing, for I will receive the $500 in any case.”\n\n Likewise, if God grants his grace without our becoming qualified for it, all those who became saints in the past will complain, “What is this? We strived for many lifetimes to purify ourselves and then we became recipients of God’s grace, but this person received it without making himself eligible.\n\n Then our effort for self-improvement was meaningless.”\n\n God says, “I do not behave in this irrational manner.\n\n I have an eternal condition on the basis of which I bestow my grace.\n\n And I have declared this in all the scriptures.”\n\n The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states: yo brahmāṇaṁ vidadhāti pūrvaṁ yo vai vedānśh cha prahiṇoti tasmai taṁ ha devaṁ ātma-buddhi-prakāśhaṁ mumukṣhur vai śharaṇam ahaṁ prapadye  \n***(.18)***\n[v30] “We take shelter of that Supreme Being who created Brahma and others.\n\n It is by his grace that the soul and intellect get illumined.”\n\n The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states: mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarva-dehinām yāhi sarvātma-bhāvena mayā syā hy akuto-bhayaḥ  \n***(1.1.15)***\n[v31] “O Uddhav! Giving up all forms of mundane social and religious conventions, simply surrender unto me, the Supreme Soul of all souls.\n\n Only then can you cross over this material ocean and become fearless.”\n\n Shree Krishna also stated it in verse .14 of the Bhagavad Gita : “My divine energy Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome.\n\n But those who surrender unto me cross over it easily.”\n\n The Ramayan also says: sanamukha hoi jīva mohi jabahīṅ, janma koṭi agha nāsahiṅ tabahīṅ [v32] “The moment the soul surrenders to God, its account of sinful deeds in endless past lifetimes is destroyed by his grace.”\n\n In the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has reiterated the principle of the necessity for surrendering to God to receive his grace.\n\n The details of what it means to surrender are explained in the Hari Bhakti Vilas, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the Vayu Puran, and the Ahirbudhni Samhita in the following manner: ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ pratikūlyasya varjanam rakṣhiṣhyatīti viśhvāso goptṛitve varaṇaṁ tathā ātmanikṣhepa kārpaṇye ṣhaḍvidhā śharaṇāgatiḥ  \n***(Hari Bhakti Vilas 1.676)***\n[v33] The above verse explains the six aspects of surrender to God: . To desire only in accordance with the desire of God.\n\n By nature, we are his servants, and the duty of a servant is to fulfill the desire of the master.\n\n So as surrendered devotees of God, we must make our will conform to the divine will of God.\n\n A dry leaf is surrendered to the wind.\n\n It does not complain whether the wind lifts it up, takes it forward or backward, or drops it to the ground.\n\n Similarly, we too must learn to be happy in the happiness of God.\n\n . Not to desire against the desire of God.\n\n Whatever we get in life is a result of our past and present karmas.\n\n \n\nHowever, the fruits of the karmas do not come by themselves.\n\n God notes them and gives the results at the appropriate t.\n\n Since God himself dispenses the results, we must learn to serenely accept them.\n\n Usually, when people get wealth, fame, pleasure, and luxuries in the world, they forget to thank God.\n\n \n\nHowever, if they get suffering, they blame God for it, “Why did God do this to me?” The second aspect of surrender means to not complain about whatever God gives us.\n\n . To have firm faith that God is protecting us.\n\n God is the eternal father.\n\n He is taking care of all the living beings in creation.\n\n There are trillions of ants on the planet earth, and all of them need to eat regularly.\n\n Do you ever find that a few thousand ants in your garden have died of starvation? God ensures that they are all provided for.\n\n On the other hand, elephants eat mounds of food every day.\n\n God provides for them too.\n\n Even a worldly father cares and provides for his children.\n\n Why then should we doubt whether our eternal father, God, will take care of us or not? To have firm faith in his protection is the third aspect of surrender.\n\n . To maintain an attitude of gratitude toward God.\n\n We have received so many priceless gifts from the Lord.\n\n The earth that we walk upon, the sunlight with which we see, the air that we breathe, and the water that we drink, are all given to us by God.\n\n In fact, it is because of him that we exist; he has brought us to life and imparted consciousness in our soul.\n\n We are not paying him any tax in return, but we must at least feel deeply indebted for all that he has given to us.\n\n This is the sentiment of gratitude.\n\n The reverse of this is the sentiment of ungratefulness.\n\n \n\nFor example, a father does so much for his child.\n\n The child is told to be grateful to his father for this.\n\n But the child responds, “Why should I be grateful? His father took care of him and he is taking care of me.”\n\n This is ingratitude toward the worldly father.\n\n To be grateful toward God, our eternal Father, for all that he has given to us, is the fourth aspect of surrender.\n\n . To see everything we possess as belonging to God.\n\n God created this entire world; it existed even before we were born, and will continue to exist even after we die.\n\n Hence, the true owner of everything is God alone.\n\n When we think something belongs to us, we forget the proprietorship of God.\n\n Let us say that someone comes into your house when you are not at home.\n\n He wears your clothes, takes things out of your refrigerator, eats them, and sleeps on your bed.\n\n On returning, you ask indignantly, “What have you been doing in my house?” He says, “I have not damaged anything.\n\n I have merely used everything properly.\n\n Why are you getting annoyed?” You will reply, “You may not have destroyed anything, but it all belongs to me.\n\n If you use it without my permission, you are a thief.”\n\n Similarly, this world and everything in it belongs to God.\n\n To remember this and give up our sense of proprietorship is the fifth aspect of surrender.\n\n . To give up the pride of having surrendered.\n\n If we become proud of the good deeds that we have done, the pride dirties our heart and undoes the good we have done.\n\n That is why it is important to keep an attitude of humbleness: “If I was able to do something nice, it was only because God inspired my intellect in the right direction.\n\n Left to myself, I would never have been able to do it.”\n\n To keep such an attitude of humility is the sixth aspect of surrender.\n\n If we can perfect these six points of surrender in ourselves, we will fulfill God’s condition and he will bestow his Grace upon us.",

        "explanation": "All along, Shree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously—engage his mind in devotion, and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior.\n\n He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriya dharma , but to do devotion alongside with it.\n\n This is the principle of karm yog . \n\nNow, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even material dharma . Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God.\n\n This is the principle of karm sanyās . Here, one may question that if we give up all our material dharmas will we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence.\n\n To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term dharma . It comes from the root word dhṛi , which means dhāraṇ karane yogya , or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.”\n\n There are actually two kinds of dharmas —material dharma and spiritual dharma . These two kinds of dharma are based upon two different understandings of the “self.”\n\n When we identify ourselves as the body, then our dharma is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms.\n\n Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, . are all bodily dharma . This is also called apara dharma or material dharma . This includes the dharma as a Brahmin, Kshatriya, . \n\nHowever, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations of varṇa  \n***(social class)***\n and āśhram  \n***(status in life)***\n.\n\n The soul’s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God.\n\n Hence our one and only dharma becomes loving devotional service to God.\n\n This is also called para dharma or spiritual dharma . If one leaves the material dharma it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty.\n\n But if one leaves material dharma and takes the shelter of spiritual dharma , it is not a sin.\n\n The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states: devarṣhi-bhūtāpta-nṛiṇāṁ pitṝīṇāṁ na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛiṇī cha rājan sarvātmanā yaḥ śharaṇaṁ śharaṇyaṁ gato mukundaṁ parihṛitya kartam  \n***(1..41)***\n[v37] This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts—to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings.\n\n The varṇāśhram system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts.\n\n \n\nHowever, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered.\n\n Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone.\n\n Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material dharma if we are properly situated in spiritual dharma . In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual dharma . The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states: ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api svakān dharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ  \n***(1.1.32)***\n [v38] “I have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily dharma in the Vedas.\n\n But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best sādhaks .” In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest.\n\n He said: guru pitu mātu na jānahu kāhū, kahahu subhāū nātha patiyāū more sabahiñ eka tumha swāmī, dinabhandhu ura antarayamī [v39] “O Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, . As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.”\n\n Similarly, Prahlad said: mātā nāsti pitā na ’sti na ’sti me swajano janaḥ [v40] “I do not know any mother, father, or relative  \n***(God is everything to me)***\n.”\n\n In the Bhagavad Gita , Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions.\n\n Initially, he instructed Arjun to do karm , . his material dharma as a warrior  \n***(verse .31)***\n.\n\n But material dharma does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back.\n\n Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to do karm yog , . his material dharma with the body and spiritual dharma with the mind.\n\n He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind  \n***(verse .7)***\n.\n\n This instruction of karm yog forms the major portion of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n \n\nNow in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice karm sanyās , . renounce all material dharma and simply adopt spiritual dharma , which is love for God.\n\n He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so.\n\n But why did Shree Krishna not give this instruction to Arjun earlier? Why did he seem to clearly extol just the reverse in verse .2 when he stated karm yog superior as to karm sanyās? Lord Krishna clearly explains this in the next verse.",

He says such preachers first attain his para bhakti , and then attain him.\n\n The opportunity to engage ourselves in devotion is a special blessing of God, but the opportunity to help others engage in devotion is an even bigger blessing, which attracts the special grace of God.\n\n Whenever we share something good with others, we benefit from it too.\n\n When we share whatever knowledge we have with others, by grace our own knowledge increases as well.\n\n By often giving food to others, we never go hungry ourselves.\n\n Saint Kabir said: dāna diye dhana nā ghaṭe, nadī ghate na nīra apane hātha dekha lo, yoṅ kyā kahe kabīra [v42] “Wealth does not decrease by giving in charity; a river does not become narrow, though people take water from it.\n\n I am not saying this without basis; see it yourself in the world.”\n\n \n\nThus, those who share the spiritual knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita with others receive the highest blessing themselves.",

        "explanation": "Not everyone has the intellect to comprehend the deep imports of the dialogue between Shree Krishna and Arjun.\n\n Here, Shree Krishna reassures that if such people merely hear with faith, they will also benefit.\n\n God is seated within them; he will note their sincere endeavor and reward them for it.\n\n A story about a disciple of Jagadguru Shankaracharya, called Sananda, illustrates this point.\n\n He was illiterate and could not comprehend his Guru’s teaching as the other disciples could.\n\n But when Shankaracharya delivered the discourse, he would listen with rapt attention and great faith.\n\n One day, he was washing his Guru’s clothes on the other side of the river.\n\n It became time for the class, and the other disciples requested, “Guruji, please begin the class.”\n\n Shankaracharya replied, “Let us wait; Sananda is not here.”\n\n “But Guruji, he cannot understand anything, ” the disciples urged.\n\n “That is true; still, he listens with great faith and so I do not wish to disappoint him, ” said Shankaracharya.\n\n Then, to show the power of faith, Shankaracharya called out, “Sananda! Please come here.”\n\n On hearing his Guru’s words, Sananda did not hesitate.\n\n He ran on water.\n\n The story goes that wherever he placed his feet, lotus flowers sprang up to support him.\n\n He crossed over to the other bank and offered obeisance to his Guru.\n\n At that time, a stuti  \n***(verses in praise)***\n of the Guru emanated from his mouth in sophisticated Sanskrit.\n\n The other disciples were amazed to hear this.\n\n Since, lotus flowers had bloomed under his feet, his name became “Padmapada, ” meaning “the one with lotus flowers under the feet.”\n\n He became one of the four main disciples of Shankaracharya, along with Sureshwaracharya, Hastamalak, and Trotakacharya.\n\n In the above verse, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that even those who merely hear the sacred dialogue with great faith will gradually become purified.",

If we wish to truly receive this knowledge, we must not merely read it, but also attract Shree Krishna’s grace with an attitude of faith and loving surrender.\n\n Then we will know the purport of the Bhagavad Gita by his grace.",
