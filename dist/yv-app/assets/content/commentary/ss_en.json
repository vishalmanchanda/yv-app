    "explanation": "**Commentary on Dharma**\n\n### The Significance of Family in Hinduism\n\nIn the context of Hinduism, the concept of family is deeply rooted in the practice of Dharma. The question arises: \"कुलक्षये\" (kulkshaye) in the destruction of a family? प्रणश्यन्ति\" (pranashyanti) perish? कुलधर्माः\" (kuldharmah) family religious rites? सनातनाः\" (sanaatanaah) immemorial? धर्मे\" (dharme) spirituality? नष्टे\" (nasthe) being destroyed? कुलम्\" (kulum) the whole family? अधर्मः\" (adharmah) impiety? अभिभवति\" (abhibhavati) overcomes?\n\n### The Role of Dharma in Family Life\n\nDharma, the duties and ceremonies practised by the family in accordance with the injunctions of the scriptures, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance and harmony within the family. It is essential to understand that Dharma is not just a set of rituals, but a way of life that encompasses the spiritual and moral aspects of human existence.\n\n### The Importance of Family Spirituality\n\nThe concept of family spirituality is deeply rooted in the idea that the family is a sacred institution, and its well-being is essential for the overall well-being of society. The family's spiritual practices are designed to promote a sense of unity, harmony, and balance among its members.\n\n### The Consequences of Impiety\n\nOn the other hand, impiety (अधर्मः) can have devastating consequences on the family's well-being. When the family deviates from its spiritual practices and duties, it can lead to a breakdown in social norms and values. This, in turn, can have far-reaching consequences on the family's relationships, reputation, and overall quality of life.\n\n### The Power of Overcoming Adversity\n\nUltimately, the family's ability to overcome adversity and challenges is what defines its strength and resilience. By embracing Dharma and practicing family spirituality, the family can develop the necessary tools to navigate life's ups and downs and emerge stronger and more united than ever."

It is beyond all bounds and limitations, and is the ultimate reality that underlies all existence.\n\n**Removing Delusion**\n\nBy removing Arjuna's delusion, grief, and despondency, which are born of ignorance, Lord Krishna induces him to fight. This is because the Self is not something that can be defeated or overcome, but rather it is the ultimate reality that must be acknowledged and accepted.\n\n**The Call to Action**\n\nTherefore, Arjuna is called upon to fight, not because he will be defeated, but because he must acknowledge and accept the reality of his own immortal Self.\n\n**\"युध्यस्व\"**\n\nAs Lord Krishna says, \"युध्यस्व\" or \"fight\". This is not a call to physical combat, but rather a call to spiritual warfare. Arjuna must fight against his own ignorance and delusions, in order to acknowledge and accept the reality of his immortal Self.\n\n**For Bharata**\n\nThis commentary is for the benefit of Bharata, and serves as a reminder that the ultimate reality is not something to be feared or overcome, but rather it is the source of all existence and power."

    "explanation": "**Commentary**\n\nThe body of any creature may be destroyed, but the Self cannot be killed.\nTherefore, you should not grieve regarding any creature whatever.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The body of a creature can be destroyed, but the Self remains indestructible.\n*   This concept is often referred to as \"dehi\" or the individual self, which is eternal and cannot be killed.\n*   The idea is that just as a tree can grow back from its roots after being cut down, the Self can also be reborn and rejuvenated.\n*   This understanding is rooted in the concept of \"avidya,\" or ignorance, which prevents us from realizing our true nature as eternal and indestructible.\n*   The verse emphasizes the importance of not grieving regarding any creature, as this is a form of attachment that can prevent us from realizing our true nature.\n\n### Context\n\nThis verse is often attributed to the ancient Indian sage, Adi Shankara. It is a key concept in Advaita Vedanta philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality.\n\n### Implications\n\n*   Recognizing that the body can be destroyed, but the Self cannot be killed, allows us to cultivate a sense of detachment and acceptance in our lives.\n*   This understanding can help us to let go of attachment to material possessions and relationships, which are ultimately impermanent.\n*   By recognizing the eternal nature of the Self, we can also cultivate a sense of compassion and empathy for all living beings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe verse emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of reality, and recognizing that the body can be destroyed, but the Self cannot be killed. By cultivating this understanding, we can cultivate a sense of detachment and acceptance in our lives, and develop a deeper appreciation for the eternal nature of the Self."

The key points of Karma Yoga are:\n\n*   **Performing work without expectation of fruits**: The Karma Yogi should perform work without expecting any rewards or benefits from their actions.\n*   **Without the idea of agency**: The Karma Yogi should not think \"I do this\" or \"this is my work\".\n*   **Without attachment**: The Karma Yogi should not be attached to their work or the outcome of their actions.\n*   **Beyond pairs of opposites**: The Karma Yogi should strive to go beyond all the pairs of opposites, such as heat and cold, gain and loss, victory and defeat, etc.\n\n**Consequences of Karma Yoga**\n\nThe Karma Yogi who works without attachment and egoism will not be touched by Dharma (righteousness) and Adharma (wrongdoing). Merit and demerit will not affect them. The Karma Yogi consecrates all their works and their fruits as offerings unto the Lord (Isvararpanam) and thus obtains the grace of the Lord (Isvaraprasada).\n\n**The Goal of Karma Yoga**\n\nThe ultimate goal of Karma Yoga is to break free from the bonds of Karma and attain Self-realisation.

Man takes a body to enjoy them. If anyone performs actions for the sake of God in fulfillment of His purpose without desire for the fruits, he is released from the bonds of birth and attains to the blissful state or the immortal abode.\n\n### The Role of Wisdom in Karma Yoga\n\nSages who possess evenness of mind abandon the fruits of their actions and thus escape from good and bad actions.\n\n### The Significance of Verse 49-51\n\nThe three verses (49, 50, and 51) refer to the wisdom of the Sankhyas, which is the knowledge of the Self or Atma. This knowledge dawns when the mind is purified by Karma Yoga.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   Clinging to the fruits of actions leads to rebirth.\n*   Performing actions for God's purpose without desire for fruits leads to liberation.\n*   Sages who possess evenness of mind abandon the fruits of their actions and escape good and bad actions.\n*   The three verses (49, 50, and 51) refer to the wisdom of the Sankhyas, which is the knowledge of the Self or Atma.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe three verses (49, 50, and 51) describe the nature of karma and the path to liberation. The first verse highlights the importance of understanding that actions have consequences, while the second verse emphasizes the need to perform actions without attachment to their fruits. The third verse refers to the wisdom of the Sankhyas, which is the knowledge of the Self or Atma. This knowledge can be achieved through Karma Yoga, a path that involves selfless action and purification of the mind.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three verses (49, 50, and 51) offer valuable insights into the nature of karma and the path to liberation. By understanding these verses, one can gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of selfless action and the pursuit of wisdom."

Just as the wind carries away a boat from its course?\n\n#### The Consequences of Sensual Objectivity\n\n*   **Loss of Discrimination**: The mind's constant dwelling on sensual objects leads to a loss of discrimination, making it difficult for the individual to distinguish between what is truly important and what is not.\n*   **Distraction from Spiritual Path**: The mind's attachment to sensual objects distracts the individual from his spiritual path, causing him to lose focus and direction.\n\n#### A Parable for Understanding\n\nJust as the wind carries away a boat from its course?\n\n*   **The Wind as Sensual Objects**: The wind can be compared to the sensual objects that distract us from our spiritual path.\n*   **The Boat as Our Spiritual Path**: The boat represents our spiritual path, which is easily disrupted by the wind (sensual objects).\n*   **Consequences of Distraction**: Just as the boat is carried away from its course, our spiritual path is also disrupted when we become distracted by sensual objects.\n\n### The Mind's Carrying Away of the Aspirant\n\nSo also the mind carries away the aspirant from his spiritual path and turns him towards the objects of the senses.\n\n#### The Mind's Role in Spiritual Distraction\n\n*   **The Mind as a Distraction**: The mind plays a significant role in distracting us from our spiritual path, making it difficult for us to focus and stay on course.\n*   **The Aspirant's Suffering**: The aspirant suffers as a result of the mind's distraction, losing his spiritual progress and becoming further entangled in the cycle of birth and death.\n\n#### The Importance of Discrimination\n\nDiscrimination is essential for spiritual growth, as it allows us to distinguish between what is truly important and what is not. By cultivating discrimination, we can avoid the distractions of sensual objects and stay focused on our spiritual path.\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe mind which constantly dwells on the sensual objects and moves in company with the senses destroys altogether the discrimination of the man. Just as the wind carries away a boat from its course? So also the mind carries away the aspirant from his spiritual path and turns him towards the objects of the senses.\n\n#### The Need for Spiritual Awareness\n\nIt is essential to develop spiritual awareness and cultivate discrimination in order to avoid the distractions of sensual objects and stay focused on our spiritual path. By doing so, we can overcome the mind's tendency to carry us away from our spiritual goals and stay on course."

(Cf.III.7)\n\n### Explanation\n\nTo understand this verse, let's break it down:\n\n*   **तस्मात् therefore?**: This question seems to be asking why the senses should be controlled.\n*   **यस्य whose?**: This is a question about \"whose\" senses are being controlled.\n*   **महाबाहो O mightyarmed?**: This phrase is asking if the person controlling their senses is strong or powerful.\n*   **निगृहीतानि restrained?**: This phrase means that the senses are being controlled or restrained.\n*   **सर्वशः completely?**: This phrase is asking if the person's senses are completely under control.\n*   **इन्द्रियाणि the senses?**: This phrase is asking about the person's senses.\n*   **इन्द्रियार्थेभ्यः from the senseobjects?**: This phrase is asking about the person's senses in relation to their objects.\n*   **तस्य his?**: This phrase is asking about the person who controls their senses.\n*   **प्रज्ञा knowledge?**: This phrase is asking about the person's knowledge.\n*   **प्रतिष्ठिता is steady**: This phrase means that the person's knowledge is steady.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn essence, this verse is asking why someone would want to control their senses. The answer lies in the fact that when the senses are completely controlled, the mind cannot wander wildly in the sensual grooves. It becomes steady like a lamp in a windless place, indicating a state of inner peace and stability. This is the ultimate goal of yoga: to establish oneself in the Self and achieve steady knowledge.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The senses should be completely controlled.\n*   This control leads to a state of inner peace and stability.\n*   The mind becomes steady like a lamp in a windless place.\n*   This state is achieved when the Yogi establishes himself in the Self and his knowledge becomes steady."

The Gunas are three primary qualities that govern the universe and influence human behavior.\n\n#### The Three Gunas\n\nThe three Gunas are:\n\n*   **Sattva**: Harmony, light, or purity. Sattvic actions help a man attain Moksha (liberation).\n*   **Rajas**: Passion or motion. Rajasic actions bind a man to Samsara (the cycle of birth and death).\n*   **Tamas**: Inertia or darkness. Tamic actions also bind a man to Samsara.\n\n### The Role of the Gunas\n\nThe Gunas play a crucial role in shaping human behavior and influencing our actions. They are like forces that drive us towards certain outcomes.\n\n#### How the Gunas Affect Human Behavior\n\nThe Gunas affect human behavior in several ways:\n\n*   **Ignorant Man**: The ignorant man, who has no knowledge of the Self and is swayed by Avidya (nescience), is driven helplessly to action by the Gunas. He is helpless and bound to Samsara.\n*   **Knowledge of the Self**: The man who has knowledge of the Self and has transcended the Gunas becomes a Gunatita (one who has transcended the alities of Nature). He is no longer bound by the Gunas and can achieve Moksha.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Gunas are a fundamental concept in Hindu philosophy.

This sets the stage for exploring the consequences of remaining inactive.\n\n#### हि (Surely)\nThe word \"हि\" is a rhetorical question, emphasizing the certainty of the outcome.\n\n#### अहम् (I)\nThe word \"अहम्\" is a declaration of self-awareness, affirming that the speaker is indeed the one who will remain inactive.\n\n#### I? (I?)\nThe question \"I?\" is a rhetorical inquiry, seeking to understand the nature of the speaker's inactivity.\n\n#### न (Not)\nThe word \"न\" is a negative response to the question, indicating that the speaker's inactivity will have consequences.\n\n#### वर्तेयम् (Engage)\nThe word \"वर्तेयम्\" is a command to engage in action, contrasting with the idea of remaining inactive.\n\n#### Myself (My)\nThe word \"मम\" is a possessive pronoun, emphasizing that the speaker's inactivity will affect themselves.\n\n#### वर्त्म (Path)\nThe word \"वर्त्म\" is a reference to the path or way of life, highlighting the importance of action.\n\n#### अनुवर्तन्ते (Follow)\nThe word \"अनुवर्तन्ते\" is a verb meaning \"to follow\", implying that people will imitate the speaker's behavior.\n\n#### मनुष्याः (Men)\nThe word \"मनुष्याः\" is a plural noun, referring to men.\n\n#### पार्थ (O Partha)\nThe word \"पार्थ\" is a reference to Arjuna, the character in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n#### सर्वशः (in every way)\nThe word \"सर्वशः\" is an adverb meaning \"in every way\", emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the consequences.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe verse warns that if one remains inactive, people will imitate their behavior and decline into a state of inertia.

It asks:\n\n*   By which power or force is this person impelled to perform good deeds?\n*   Is he doing so out of a desire for liberation from sin (pāpa) or is it his inherent nature to do so?\n*   Is he a man (pūrūṣa) who is not attached to worldly life or is he merely going through the motions?\n*   Is he doing so out of a desire for something else, or is it an inherent part of his nature?\n*   Is he doing so even without any desire or expectation?\n\nThe verse is essentially asking whether the person's actions are driven by a desire for liberation or if it is simply his inherent nature.\n\n### Contextual Clues\n--------------------\n\n*   The use of the word \"प्रयुक्तः\" (prayuktah) implies that the person's actions are driven by a force or power beyond his control.\n*   The phrase \"अयम् this\" suggests that the person's actions are being referred to as a whole, encompassing all his deeds and qualities.\n*   The word \"नियोजितः\" (niyuktah) implies that the person's actions are being constrained or guided by some external force.\n\n### Implications\n--------------\n\nThe verse is highlighting the complexities of human nature and the role of external forces in shaping our actions. It suggests that true liberation can only be achieved by understanding and transcending the constraints of the external world.\n\n### Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe verse 3.36 is a profound exploration of the human condition, highlighting the complexities of motivation and the role of external forces in shaping our actions.

This is its nature? It is called the seat?\n\n### Explanation\n\nIf the abode of the enemy is known, it is easy to kill him. So Lord Krishna, like a wise army general, points out to Arjuna the abode of desire so that he may be able to attack it and kill it readily.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The abode of the enemy is known when we understand its true nature.\n*   Lord Krishna uses the analogy of a wise army general to explain this concept to Arjuna.\n*   The abode of desire is the seat of our deepest desires and attachments.\n\n### Verse 3.40 in Action\n\n*   When we recognize the abode of desire, we can begin to attack and overcome it.\n*   This recognition is key to achieving spiritual growth and self-realization.\n\n### Verse 3.40: एतैः विमोहयति, एषः ज्ञानम्\n\nBy these it deludes? This is the wisdom?\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe abode of desire can be said to \"delude\" us because it creates a sense of attachment and illusion. However, true wisdom recognizes this delusion and allows us to transcend it.\n\n### Verse 3.40: आवृत्य देहिनम्\n\nHaving enveloped the embodied?\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe abode of desire can be said to have \"enveloped\" us because it surrounds and influences our thoughts, emotions, and actions."

In other words, it's the type of knowledge that comes from studying scriptures and not directly from personal experience.\n\n#### **Vijnana is direct knowledge or personal experience**\n\nThis type of knowledge is known as Vijnana. It's the direct result of self-realisation or Aparoksha Jnaana, which is personal experience and not obtained through scriptures.\n\n### **Control the senses first and then kill desire**\n\nThe verse advises us to control our senses first, which is a crucial step in the journey of self-realisation. Once we have controlled our senses, we can then focus on killing desire, which is the root cause of all suffering.\n\n### **Key Points**\n\n*   **Control the senses**: The first step in self-realisation is to control our senses.\n*   **Kill desire**: Once we have controlled our senses, we can then focus on killing desire.\n*   **Jnana and Vijnana**: There are two types of knowledge: Jnana (obtained through scriptures) and Vijnana (personal experience).\n*   **Paroksha Jnana and Aparoksha Jnana**: Paroksha Jnana is indirect knowledge obtained through scriptures, while Aparoksha Jnana is direct knowledge or personal experience.\n\n### **Destroyer of Knowledge and Realisation (Wisdom)**\n\nThe verse also mentions the destroyer of knowledge and realisation, which is a powerful concept in Hindu philosophy.

The mind can perform the functions of the five senses.\n\n**The Superiority of the Intellect**\n\nThe intellect is superior to the mind because it is endowed with the faculty of discrimination. When the mind is in a state of doubt, the intellect comes to its rescue.\n\n**The Superiority of the Self**\n\nThe Self, or the Witness, is superior even to the intellect.

    "explanation": "**Understanding Karma: Action, Inaction, and the Path**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Concept of Karma\n\nIn Hinduism and Buddhism, karma refers to the idea that every action has consequences. This concept is central to understanding the nature of reality and our place in it.\n\n#### Types of Actions\n\nThere are three types of actions:\n\n*   **कर्मणः (Karmanaḥ)**: Action. This refers to any action we take, whether it's good or bad.\n*   **विकर्मणः (Vikarmanaḥ)**: Forbidden action. This refers to actions that are considered wrong or immoral.\n*   **अकर्मणः (Akarmanaḥ)**: Inaction. This refers to not taking any action.\n\n#### The Importance of Knowing Karma\n\nIt's essential to know that karma is a fundamental aspect of our lives. We should strive to understand the consequences of our actions and make conscious choices.\n\n#### The Path to Enlightenment\n\nThe path to enlightenment is not just about individual actions but also about understanding the interconnectedness of all things. It's a journey that requires self-awareness, introspection, and a deep understanding of the world around us.\n\n#### Deepening Our Understanding\n\nTo deepen our understanding of karma, we need to explore its various aspects. This includes examining the consequences of our actions, understanding the concept of inaction, and recognizing the interconnectedness of all things.\n\n#### The Three Aspects of Karma\n\n*   **कर्मणः (Karmanaḥ)**: Action. This refers to any action we take, whether it's good or bad.\n*   **विकर्मणः (Vikarmanaḥ)**: Forbidden action. This refers to actions that are considered wrong or immoral.\n*   **अकर्मणः (Akarmanaḥ)**: Inaction. This refers to not taking any action.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding karma is crucial for personal growth and spiritual development. By recognizing the three aspects of karma – action, inaction, and the forbidden action – we can make conscious choices that lead us down the path to enlightenment."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Karma and Inaction**\n=====================================\n\nIn common parlance, action means the movement of the body or the hands and feet. Inaction means sitting idle. However, this is not the true meaning of action or inaction.\n\n### Agency and Inaction\n\nThe idea of agency, or the notion that \"I am the doer,\" binds man to Samsara. If this idea vanishes, action is no action at all. It will not bind one to Samsara. This is inaction in action.\n\n### Witnessing Nature's Activities\n\nIf you stand as a spectator or silent witness of Nature's activities, feeling that \"Nature does everything,\" you are a non-doer (Akarta). If you identify yourself with the actionless Self, no matter what work or how much of it is done, action is no action at all. This is inaction in action.\n\n### The Restless Mind\n\nA man may sit idle, doing nothing. But if he has the idea of agency or doership, or thinks that he is the doer, he is every doing action, though he is sitting idle. This is action in inaction.\n\n### The Illusion of Action\n\nThe restless mind will ever be doing actions, even though one sits idle. Actions of the mind are real actions. Nor can anyone remain really actionless for even one moment, for Nature's alities drive everyone to action.\n\n### The Feeling of Egoism\n\nInaction also induces the feeling of egoism. The inactive man says, \"I sit idle, I do nothing.\" Inaction is wrongly attributed to the Self. He is the performer of all actions who knows this truth.\n\n### The End of All Actions\n\nHe has attained the end of all actions, i.e., freedom or knowledge or perfection.\n\n### The Illusion of Motion\n\nWhen a steamer moves, the trees on the shore appear to move in the opposite direction. Moving objects that are very far away appear stationary or motionless. Even so, in the case of the Self, inaction is mistaken for action and action for inaction.\n\n### The True Nature of Inaction\n\nThe Self is actionless (Akarta or nondoer, Nishkriya or without work). The body and senses perform action. The actions of the body and senses are falsely attributed to the actionless Self.\n\n### Ignorance\n\nThe ignorant man thinks, \"I act.\" He thinks that the Self is the doer or agent of action. This is a mistake. This is ignorance.\n\n### The Illusion of Motion (Continued)\n\nJust as motion does not really belong to the trees on the shore, which appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on board the ship, so also action does not really pertain to the Self.\n\n### The Cause of Birth and Death\n\nThis ignorance, which is the cause of birth and death, vanishes when you attain Self-realization."

    "explanation": "**Commentary on Verse 4.19**\n\n### Meaning of the Verse\nThe verse asks about the nature of a person who performs actions without any desires or purposes. It inquires whether such a person is someone whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge, or if they are simply a wise person who calls themselves a sage.\n\n### Analysis\nA sage performs actions only with the intention of setting an example to the masses. Despite working, they do nothing because they have no selfish interests. Their actions are burnt by the fire of wisdom, which is realized through the knowledge of the Self or BrahmaJnana.\n\n### The Power of Brahma Jnana\nBrahma Jnana is a mighty spiritual fire that consumes the results of all kinds of actions, both good and bad. It makes the enlightened sage free from the bonds of action.\n\n### Characteristics of a Sage\nA sage who leads a life of perfect renunciation does only what is required for the bare existence of their body. They are free from the cycle of birth and death, and their actions are guided by wisdom.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   A sage performs actions without desires or purposes.\n*   Their actions are burnt by the fire of wisdom.\n*   Brahma Jnana is a mighty spiritual fire that consumes the results of all kinds of actions.\n*   A sage leads a life of perfect renunciation, doing only what is required for existence."

It highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the Self, which transcends all activity and attachment.\n\n#### Key Points\n\n*   **Attachment to the Fruits of Action**: Having abandoned attachment to the outcomes of one's actions, and being content with what is.\n*   **Dependence on Nothing**: Not depending on anything, just as a person who has the favor of the king does not rely on their minister or government official.\n*   **Engagement in Activity**: Being ever engaged in activity, yet possessing the knowledge of the Self which is beyond all activity.\n*   **Realization of the Self**: Realizing one's identity with the Self, which is beyond all desires and attachments.\n\n#### The Nature of Brahman\n\nAs Brahman, the Absolute, is self-contained, all desires are gratified when one realizes their true nature. This realization brings about a state of satisfaction and contentment, unconnected to external factors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe verse serves as a reminder that true inaction is possible, even when one appears to be actively engaged. It encourages the reader to cultivate a deeper understanding of the Self, which lies beyond all activity and attachment."

This includes:\n\n*   **Nirasha:** Without hope?\n    *   Is he one with the mind and self-controlled?\n*   **Tyakti Sarva Parigraha:** Having abandoned all covetousness?\n*   **Shariram:** Bodily?\n    *   Is it merely a physical existence, or is there more to it?\n*   **Karma:** Action?\n    *   Is he doing something, or is it merely a formality?\n\n### The Liberated Sage's Perspective\n\nFor a man who thirsts for liberation (Mumukshu), even righteous activity (Dharma) is a sin as it causes bondage to Samsara. This is because Dharma, which is considered good and virtuous by many, can actually be a fetter that holds us back from true liberation.\n\n### The Golden Fetters of Dharma and Adharma\n\nA sage is liberated from both Dharma and Adharma.

In this context, we will explore the different types of Yajna and their significance.\n\n### Types of Yajna\n\n#### 1. Karma Yoga\nSome Yogis who are devoted to Karma Yoga perform sacrificial rites to the shining ones or Devas (gods). This type of Yajna is performed by those who are dedicated to the path of action and selfless service.\n\n#### 2. Jnana Yoga\nThe second Yajna is JnanaYajna or the wisdom sacrifice performed by those who are devoted to Jnana Yoga. This type of Yajna is performed by those who seek knowledge and understanding of the ultimate reality.\n\n#### Characteristics of JnanaYajna\n* The oblation in this sacrifice is the Self.\n* Yajna here means the Self.\n* The Upadhis or the limiting adjuncts such as the physical body, the mind, and the intellect are sublated (overcome) through ignorance.\n* The identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul or Brahman is realised.\n\n#### Realization through Yajna\nTo sacrifice the self in Brahman is to know through direct cognition (Aparoksha Anubhuti) that the individual soul is identical with Brahman. This is the highest Yajna.\n\n#### Superiority of JnanaYajna\nThose who are established in Brahman, those who have realised their oneness with the Supreme Soul or Paramatma perform this kind of sacrifice. This is superior to all other sacrifices.\n\n### Conclusion\nYajna, in its various forms, represents the ultimate sacrifice of the self to the divine. Through this sacrifice, one can realize their true nature and establish a deep connection with the Supreme Soul or Brahman."

The question arises, \"What is the purpose of Pranayama?\" Let us explore this further.\n\n### The Breath: Apaan and Prana\n--------------------------------\n\nThe breath is divided into two parts: the outgoing breath (Apana) and the incoming breath (Prana). The question is, \"Is it Apaan or Prana that we should focus on?\" The answer lies in the practice of Pranayama.\n\n#### Apaan (Outgoing Breath)\n-------------------------\n\n*   **Apapane**: The outgoing breath is associated with the Prana that moves outward from the body.\n*   **Juhvati**: The outgoing breath is also associated with the sacrifice of the Prana that moves outward from the body.\n*   **Prana**: The incoming breath is associated with the Prana that moves inward into the body.\n*   **Pranae**: The incoming breath is also associated with the Prana that moves inward into the body.\n*   **Apanam**: The outgoing breath is associated with the Prana that moves outward from the body.\n*   **Thus**: The practice of Pranayama is thus associated with the control of the breath.\n\n#### Apapanagatii (Courses of Breath)\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   **Rudhva**: The courses of the outgoing and incoming breaths are associated with the restraint of the breath.\n*   **Pranaayamaparayanah**: The practice of Pranayama is associated with the sole absorption in the restraint of breath.\n\n### Practice of Pranayama\n-------------------------\n\nSome Yogis practice Puraka (inhalation), some practice Rechaka (exhalation), and some practice Kumbhaka (retention of breath). The five sub-Pranas and the other Pranas are merged in the chief Prana (Mukhya Prana) by the practice of Pranayama.\n\n### Control of Prana\n-------------------\n\nWhen the Prana is controlled, the mind also stops its wanderings and becomes steady. The senses are also thinned out and merged in the Prana. It is through the vibration of Prana that the activities of the mind and the senses are kept up.\n\n### Effects of Controlled Prana\n---------------------------------\n\n*   **Controlled Prana**: When the Prana is controlled, the mind, intellect, and senses cease to function.\n*   **Vibration of Prana**: The vibration of Prana keeps the activities of the mind and senses up.\n*   **Steady Mind**: The controlled Prana leads to a steady mind, free from wanderings.\n*   **Thinned Senses**: The senses are thinned out and merged in the Prana, leading to a state of balance and harmony."

This is reducing actions to ashes.\n\nThe actions lose their potency as they are burnt by the fire of knowledge. When the knowledge of the Self dawns, all actions with their results are burnt by the fire of that knowledge just as fuel is burnt by the fire.\n\nWhen there is no agencymentality (the idea I do this)? when there is no desire for the fruits? action is no action at all. It has lost its potency.\n\nThe fire of knowledge can burn all actions except the Prarabdha Karma? or the result of the past action which has brought this body into existence and which has thus already begun to bear fruits or produce effects.\n\n### Types of Karmas\n\nAccording to some philosophers, even the Prarabdha Karma is destroyed by the fire of knowledge.\n\n**Three Types of Karmas**\n\n1.  **Prarabdha**: So much of the past actions as has given rise to the present birth.\n2.  **Sanchita**: The balance of the past actions that will give rise to future births -- the storehouse of accumulated actions.\n3.  **Agami or Kriyamana**: Acts being done in the present life.\n\n### Destruction of Karmas by Knowledge\n\nIf by the knowledge of the Self only the Sanchita and Agami were destroyed and not Prarabdha, the dual number would have been used and not the plural.\n\n**Cf.

The verse below explains the different aspects of faith and its significance.\n\n**What is Faith (Shradha)?**\n-------------------------\n\n*   **Man of faith**: The man of faith is one who has unwavering trust and confidence in the divine.\n*   **Obtains**: Faith is not just a feeling, but an action that leads to the attainment of spiritual knowledge.\n*   **Knowledge**: Knowledge is not just intellectual understanding, but a deep realization that comes from the heart.\n*   **Devoted**: Devotion is not just about serving a guru, but about surrendering one's ego and desires to the divine.\n*   **Subdued senses**: Subduing the senses is not just about controlling one's emotions, but about transcending them and reaching a higher state of consciousness.\n*   **Obtained**: Having obtained faith, knowledge, and devotion is not just a matter of intellectual understanding, but a direct experience that changes one's life.\n*   **Supreme**: The supreme peace or salvation (Moksha) that is attained through faith, knowledge, and devotion is not just a distant goal, but an immediate experience that can be realized.\n*   **Peace**: Peace is not just a feeling, but a state of being that comes from within.\n*   **At once**: The realization of faith, knowledge, and devotion can happen at once, without any delay.\n\n**The Importance of Faith in Spiritual Growth**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nFaith is the foundation upon which spiritual growth is built.

All three alifications must be present for an aspirant to attain the supreme peace of the Eternal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFaith is not just a feeling, but an action that leads to the attainment of spiritual knowledge.

This has led to confusion, as it seems like a contradictory concept.\n\n**Clarifying the Concept**\n-------------------------\n\nYoga here means Karma Yoga, which implies that one should perform actions without attachment to their outcomes.\n\n**Key Points**\n-------------\n\n*   Renunciation and performance of actions are two distinct concepts.\n*   Karma Yoga emphasizes the importance of performing actions without attachment to their outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIt is not possible for a man to resort to both renunciation and performance of actions at the same time.

He identifies himself with the Self or Brahman, and this understanding allows him to see beyond the veil of ignorance.\n\n### The Witness's Perspective\n\nThe liberated sage thinks and says: \"I do not see the eyes perceive. I do not hear the ears hear. I do not smell the nose smells.\" He beholds inaction in action, for he has burnt his actions in the fire of wisdom.\n\n### The Liberation from Actions\n\nHe realizes that the senses are mere instruments, and their actions are but a fleeting moment.

It can be interpreted as the fruit of action, but only when done without expectation of personal gain or profit.\n\n### The Harmonious Man\n\nThe harmonious man who performs actions for the Lord without attachment to personal gain or profit, and says:\n\n> \"I do actions for my Lord only. Not for my personal gain or profit.\"\n\nThis man attains to the peace born of devotion through four stages:\n\n#### The Four Stages of Santim\n\n1. **Purity of Mind**: The first stage is the attainment of purity of mind, free from attachments and desires.\n2. **Attainment of Knowledge**: The second stage is the attainment of knowledge, which helps to understand the true nature of reality.\n3. **Renunciation of Actions**: The third stage is the renunciation of actions, which involves letting go of attachments to personal gain or profit.\n4. **Steadiness in Wisdom**: The fourth and final stage is the steadiness in wisdom, which involves cultivating a deep understanding of the nature of reality.\n\n### The Unbalanced Man\n\nOn the other hand, the unbalanced or unharmonised man who is led by desire and attached to the fruits of actions, and says:\n\n> \"I have done such and such an action.

It requires the cultivation of four stages: purity of mind, attainment of knowledge, renunciation of actions, and steadiness in wisdom. The unbalanced man, on the other hand, is led by desire and attached to personal gain or profit, resulting in a state of firm bondage."

This means that he has established himself in the practice of yoga, and his mind is steady and unwavering.\n\n**The Conditions for Being a Yogarudha**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTo be considered a yogarudha, one must meet the following conditions:\n\n*   **Attachment to sense objects**: A yogi should not have attachment to sensual objects such as sound.\n*   **Attachment to actions**: A yogi should not have attachment to actions (karmas).\n*   **Renunciation of thoughts**: A yogi should renounce all thoughts, which generate various sorts of desires for the objects of this world and the next.\n\n**The Nature of Desire**\n-------------------------\n\nDesire is born of thought (sankalpa). This means that our desires are the result of our thoughts, and by changing our thoughts, we can change our desires.\n\n**The Renunciation of Thoughts**\n---------------------------------\n\nRenouncing all thoughts implies that all desires and all actions should be renounced. This is because all desires are born of thoughts, and by changing our thoughts, we can change our desires.\n\n**The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad**\n---------------------------------\n\nAccording to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (4.4.5), \"Whatever a man desires, that he wills; and whatever he wills, that he does.\"\n\n**The Mahabharata**\n-------------------\n\nIn the Mahabharata (Santi Parva, 177.25), it is said that \"I know where thy root lies. Thou art born of Sankalpa (thought). I will not think of thee and thou shalt cease to exist along with the root.\"\n\n**The Manu Smriti**\n------------------\n\nAccording to the Manu Smriti (II.2), \"Indeed desire is born of thought (Sankalpa)? and of thought? Yajnas are born.\"\n\n**The Root of Desire**\n----------------------\n\nAs the Mahabharata says, the root of desire lies in thought (sankalpa). By not thinking of these desires, we can cease to exist along with the root.\n\n**The Power of Renunciation**\n---------------------------------\n\nRenouncing all thoughts implies that we should renounce all desires and actions. This is because all desires are born of thoughts, and by changing our thoughts, we can change our desires.\n\n**The Importance of Thinking of God or the Self**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nTo free ourselves from thinking of objects, we should think of God or the Self. This will help us avoid thinking of the objects of our senses.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\nIn conclusion, being a yogarudha means that one has established himself in the practice of yoga and his mind is steady and unwavering. Renouncing all thoughts implies that we should renounce all desires and actions, which are born of thought (sankalpa). By changing our thoughts, we can change our desires and achieve freedom from the cycle of birth and death."

Is it not the self that should be raised? Should you lower yourself or let him (the ego) lower himself? Is it not the Self that should be raised? Verily, is it only the self?\n\n### Commentary\n\n**Practice Yoga**\n-----------------\n\nDiscipline your senses and mind. Elevate yourself and become a Yogarudha. Attain to Yoga. Shine gloriously as a dynamic Yogi.\n\n**Avoid Samsara**\n-----------------\n\nDo not sink into the ocean of Samsara (transmigration). Do not become a worldly-minded man. Do not become a slave of lust, greed, and anger.\n\n**Friendship and Enmity**\n-------------------------\n\nYou alone are your friend. You alone are your enemy.\n\n*   **The Worldly Friend**: He is not your real friend because he gets attached to you, wastes your time, and puts obstacles on your path of Yoga. He is very selfish and keeps friendship with you only to extract something.\n*   **The Enemy**: If he is not able to get from you the object of his selfish interest, he forsakes you. Therefore, he is your enemy in reality.\n\n**The Mind as Friend or Enemy**\n---------------------------------\n\nFriends and enemies are not outside. They exist in the mind only. It is the mind that makes a friend an enemy and an enemy a friend.\n\n*   **The Lower Mind**: The Asuddha Manas (impure mind) is your real enemy because it binds you to Samsara.\n*   **The Higher Mind**: The Sattvic mind (Suddha Manas or the pure mind) is your real friend because it helps you in the attainment of Moksha.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe Self alone is your friend and enemy. The lower mind binds you to Samsara, while the higher mind helps you attain Moksha. Practice Yoga and discipline your senses and mind to elevate yourself and become a Yogarudha."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Self: Friend or Enemy?**\n\n### A Philosophical Inquiry\n\nIn the realm of spirituality and self-discovery, a fundamental question arises: is the Self a friend or an enemy? This inquiry delves into the nature of the Self, exploring its relationship with the mind and the consequences of our actions.\n\n### The Lower Mind: An Enemy\n\n*The lower mind is your enemy.* It is filled with Rajas and Tamas, the qualities of passion and darkness. This lower mind is a hindrance to spiritual growth and self-realization.\n\n### The Higher Mind: A Friend\n\n*The higher mind is your friend.* It is filled with Sattva, the quality of purity. This higher mind can subdue the lower mind and guide us towards self-realization.\n\n### The Self: A Friend or Enemy?\n\n*The Self is the friend of one who is self-controlled and has subjugated the lower mind and senses.* It is an ally in our spiritual journey, guiding us towards wisdom and understanding.\n\n*The Self is an enemy of one who has no self-restraint and has not subdued the lower mind and senses.* It is a source of harm, causing us to stray from our path.\n\n### The Consequences of Our Actions\n\nJust as an external enemy can cause harm, so too can our own lower self. The lower mind injures us severely, causing us to lose sight of our true nature.\n\n### The Primary and Secondary Selves\n\n*The highest Self or Atman is the primary Self.* It is the fundamental essence of our being, the source of all life and consciousness.\n\n*Mind also is self.* This secondary self is a reflection of our primary Self, a manifestation of its power and wisdom.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the nature of the Self is complex and multifaceted. It can be both a friend and an enemy, depending on our actions and choices. By cultivating self-control and subduing the lower mind, we can align ourselves with our higher Self and achieve spiritual growth and self-realization."

    "explanation": "**The Yogi: A Path of Renunciation and Self-Realization**\n\n### 6.10: The Yogi - A Mind Steady, Constant and Free\n\nThe Yogi who treads the path of renunciation (NivrittiMarga) can practise meditation in a solitary cave in the mountains. He should renounce all possessions.\n\n*   **A Householder with Yogic Tendencies**: Can practise meditation in a solitary and quiet room in his own house or any solitary place on the banks of any holy river (during the holidays or throughout the year if he is a whole-time aspirant or if he has retired from service).\n*   **Constant Practice**: The practice must be constant. Only then can one attain Self-realisation surely and quickly.\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe practice of meditation by fits and starts and for a few minutes daily will not be able to achieve any tangible results in Yoga. The Yogic aspirant should be free from hope, desire and greed. Only then will he have a steady mind.\n\n*   **Hope, Desire and Greed**: Hope, desire and greed make the mind ever restless and turbulent. They are the enemies of peace and Self-knowledge.\n*   **Possessions**: The aspirant should not have many possessions either. He can only keep those articles which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of his body.\n\n### Perfect Solitude and Peace\n\nIf you are well-established in the practice of Pratyahara, Sama and Dama (withdrawal of the senses, control of mind and body respectively), if you have the senses under your full control, you can find perfect solitude and peace even in the most crowded and noisy place of a big city.\n\n*   **Turbulent Senses**: If the senses are turbulent, if you have not got the power to withdraw them, you will have no peace of mind even in a solitary cave of the Himalayas.\n*   **Disciplined Yogi**: A disciplined Yogi who has controlled the senses and the mind can enjoy peace of mind in a solitary cave.\n\n### Apathy, Discrimination and Burning Aspiration\n\nHe who has reduced his wants, who has not a bit of attraction for the world, who has discrimination and burning aspiration for liberation, and who has observed Mauna (the vow of silence) for months together will be able to live in a cave.\n\n*   **Apathy**: He who has reduced his wants will not be bothered by the lack of worldly comforts.\n*   **Discrimination**: He who has discrimination will not be attracted to the world and its pleasures.\n*   **Burning Aspiration**: He who has burning aspiration for liberation will be able to focus on his spiritual growth.\n\n### Perfect Control over the Body\n\nYou should have perfect control over the body through the regular practice of Yoga Asanas before you take to serious and constant meditation.\n\n*   **Aparigraha**: Aparigraha means noncovetousness, freedom from possessions. The spiritual aspirant need not bother himself about his bodily needs.\n\n### Understanding the Mysterious Ways of Mother Nature\n\nThe spiritual aspirant need not bother himself about his bodily needs. Everything is provided by God. Everything is prearranged by Mother Nature.\n\n*   **Mother Nature**: She looks after the bodily needs of all very carefully in a more efficient manner than they themselves would do.\n*   **Understanding Mother Nature**: Understand the mysterious ways of Mother Nature and become wise.\n\n### Gratitude to Mother Nature\n\nBe grateful to Her for Her unique kindness, grace and mercy.\n\n*   **Gratitude**: Be grateful to Mother Nature for all that she has provided.\n*   **Mercy**: She knows better what the requirements are and provides them then and there.\n\n### Retiring into Solitude\n\nIf you want to retire into solitude for the practice of meditation, and if you are a householder with a thirst for intense spiritual Sadhana.\n\n*   **Severing Ties**: You cannot all of a sudden sever your connection with your family. Sudden severance of worldly ties may produce intense mental agony in you and shock in them.\n*   **Gradual Prolongation**: You will have to break the ties gradually. Stay for a week or a month in seclusion to begin with, then gradually prolong the period.\n\n### Developing Willpower\n\nIf your will has become very weak, as you had no religious discipline or training in schools and colleges when you were young, and as you are under the sway of materialistic influences.\n\n*   **Rigorous Japa and Meditation**: It is necessary for you to go in for seclusion for some days or weeks (during the Christmas, Easter or other holidays) to practise rigorous Japa and meditation and to develop your willpower.\n\n### Intense Meditation and Tapas\n\nThose who have fixed up their sons in life, and who have retired from service, and who have discharged their duties as householders can remain in seclusion for four or five years and practise intense meditation and Tapas (penance) for self-purification and Self-realisation.\n\n*   **Tapas**: This is like entering a university for higher studies or postgraduate course of study.\n*   **Self-Knowledge**: When the Tapas is over, and when they have attained to Self-knowledge, they should come out and share their knowledge of the Self with others through lectures, conversations, discourses or heart-to-heart talks according to their capacity and disposition.\n\n### Testing Sense-Control\n\nThe Yogic student living in a cave should test himself after he has sufficiently advanced by coming into the society of people.\n\n*   **Testing Sense-Control**: But he should not test himself every now and then like the man who removed the young plant daily after watering it to see whether it had struck deep root or not.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSense-control can be tested in a lonely forest where there are no temptations. The Yogic student living in a cave should test himself after he has sufficiently advanced by coming into the society of people."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Onepointedness in Yoga**\n=====================================================\n\n### Tatva: The Mind and Senses\n\nIn the context of yoga, tatva refers to the mind and senses. The question arises: \"Is there a single point of focus for the mind?\" The answer is yes, and this point of focus is achieved through the practice of yoga.\n\n### Onepointedness: The Goal of Yoga\n\nOnepointedness, or the ability to focus the mind on a single point, is the ultimate goal of yoga. This can be achieved by collecting all the mind's dissipated rays through practice and withdrawing them from sense objects. The goal is to fix the mind steadily on a single point, such as the Lakshya or center of meditation.\n\n### Regularity is Paramount\n\nRegular practice is essential to achieve onepointedness. Without regularity, the mind will continue to wander and disturb meditation. Therefore, it is crucial to know the ways and habits of the mind through daily introspection, self-analysis, or self-examination.\n\n### The Laws of the Mind\n\nTo check the wandering mind, one must have a knowledge of the laws of the mind. This includes understanding how thoughts arise and how they can be controlled. By knowing these laws, one can still the mind and prevent it from wandering.\n\n### The Subconscious Mind\n\nThe subconscious mind is a vast, unexplored territory that contains old thoughts and memories. When one sits for meditation or attempts to forget worldly objects, these thoughts will inevitably arise and disturb the mind. However, with regular practice, one can purify the subconscious mind and its constant memories.\n\n### The Power of Meditation\n\nMeditation is a potent antidote to annihilate worldly thoughts. It can burn away the fire of negative emotions and memories, leaving only a pure, divine energy. Through meditation, one can root out thoughts that trouble them and cultivate sublime, divine thoughts.\n\n### Introspection: A Tool for Mind Control\n\nIntrospection is a powerful tool for understanding the mind and controlling its wandering. By observing the rapid shifting of thoughts, one can mould the mind and direct it towards a divine channel. This involves rearranging thoughts, making new associations on a Sattvic basis, and throwing out worldly thoughts.\n\n### Calming Emotions and Sentiments\n\nCalm the bubbling emotions, sentiments, and impulses gradually through silent meditation. This can be achieved by giving a new orientation to feelings through gradual practice and systematic effort.\n\n### Transmuting Nature\n\nThrough meditation, one can transmute their worldly nature into divine nature. This involves exercising supreme control over nerve currents, muscles, the five sheaths (of the Self), emotions, impulses, and instincts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMeditation is a stupendous task that requires patience, determination, and the grace of the Lord. With regular practice and a willingness to control the mind, one can achieve onepointedness and cultivate a divine nature. Never despair; with persistence and dedication, one can succeed in this journey.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   Onepointedness is the ultimate goal of yoga.\n*   Regular practice is essential to achieve onepointedness.\n*   Meditation is a potent antidote to annihilate worldly thoughts.\n*   Introspection is a powerful tool for understanding the mind and controlling its wandering.\n*   Transmuting nature through meditation can lead to a divine nature."

If the body is unsteady? the mind will also become unsteady. There is an intimate connection between the body and the mind.\n\n**Key Principles of Asana and Drishti**\n\n*   You should not shake the body even a bit. \n*   You should attain mastery over the Asana (AsanaJaya) by daily practice. \n*   You should be as firm as a statue or a rock.\n\n**Benefits of Erect Body and Steady Mind**\n\n*   If you keep the body? head and neck erect? the spinal cord also will be erect and the Kundalini will rise up steadily through the subtle nervechannel (Nadi) called the Sushumna.\n*   Sit in the lotus pose or the adept pose.

This is known as the Nasikagra Drishti.\n*   **Bhrumadhya Drishti**: Gazing between the two eyebrows where the psychic centre known as the Ajna Chakra is situated. This is described in chapter V? verse 27.\n\n**Benefits of Bhrumadhya Drishti**\n\n*   In Bhrumadhya Drishti direct the gaze towards the Ajna Chakra with closed eyes. \n*   If you practise this with open eyes? it may produce headache.\n*   Foreign particles or dust may fall into the eyes. There may be distraction of the mind also.\n*   Do not strain the eyes. Practise gently.\n\n**Experiences with Drishti**\n\n*   When you practise concentration at the tip of the nose you will experience DivyaGandha (various aromas).\n*   When you concentrate your gaze at the Ajna Chakra you will experience DivyaJyotis (perception of supraphenomenal lights).\n*   This is an experience to give you encouragement? push you up in the spiritual path and convince you of the existence of transcendental or supraphysical things.\n\n**Tips for Practising Drishti**\n\n*   Do not stop your Sadhana.\n*   Yogins and those Bhaktas who meditate on Lord Siva concentrate on the Ajna Chakra with the Bhrumadhya Drishti.\n*   You can select whichever Drishti suits you best.\n\n**Key to Success**\n\n*   Though the gaze is directed towards the tip of the nose when the eyes are halfclosed and the eyalls are steady the mind should be fixed only on the self.\n*   Therefore you will have to gaze? as it were? at the tip of the nose.\n*   In chapter VI? verse 25? the Lord says Having made the mind abide in the Self? let him not think of anything.\n*   Gazing at the tip of the nose will soon bring about concentration of the mind.\n\n**Final Tips**\n\n*   Whichever be the point selected? visualise your own tutelary deity there and feel His Living Presence."

    "explanation": "**The Significance of Brahmacharya**\n=====================================\n\n### What is Brahmacharya?\n\nBrahmacharya, also known as celibacy, is a vital aspect of spiritual growth and self-realization. It refers to the practice of controlling one's desires, cravings, and sensual energies.\n\n### Qualities of a Spiritual Aspirant\n--------------------------------------\n\nA spiritual aspirant should possess the following qualities:\n\n*   **Serenity of Mind**: The Divine Light can descend only in a serene mind. Serenity is attained by the eradication of Vasanas or desires and cravings.\n*   **Fearlessness**: A fearless attitude is essential for self-realization. A timid man or a coward is very far from Self-realization.\n*   **Control over the Mind**: The aspirant should control the modifications of the mind. He should be balanced in pleasure and pain, heat and cold, honour and dishonour.\n*   **Thinking of the Lord**: He should ever think of the Lord and take Him as the Supreme Goal.\n\n### The Importance of Brahmacharya\n-----------------------------------\n\nBrahmacharya is not just a physical practice, but also a mental and spiritual one. It means:\n\n*   **Continence**: Continence is the practice of controlling one's desires and sensual energies.\n*   **Preservation of Vital Force**: The vital fluid tones the nerves and the brain, and energizes the whole system. A Brahmachari who has preserved this vital force by the vow of celibacy and sublimated it into Ojas Sakti or radiant spiritual power can practise steady meditation for a long period.\n*   **Foundation of Meditation and Samadhi**: Continence is the very foundation on which the superstructure of meditation and Samadhi can be built up.\n\n### Consequences of Lack of Brahmacharya\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMany persons waste this vital energy, a great spiritual treasure indeed, when they become blind and lose their power of reason under sexual excitement. Pitiable is their lot; They cannot make substantial progress in Yoga.\n\n### Conclusion\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, Brahmacharya is a vital aspect of spiritual growth and self-realization. It requires control over one's desires, cravings, and sensual energies. Without Brahmacharya or celibacy, not an iota of spiritual progress is possible. Continence is the very foundation on which the superstructure of meditation and Samadhi can be built up."

    "explanation": "**6.17 युक्ताहारविहारस्य**\n==========================\n\n### Of One Who is Moderate in Eating and Recreation\n\nIn this verse, the Lord prescribes for the student of Yoga: diet, recreation, and the like. The student of Yoga should always adopt the happy medium or the middle course.\n\n**The Middle Course**\n-------------------\n\nLord Buddha went to the extremes in the beginning in matters of food and drink, etc. He was very abstemious and became extremely weak. He tortured his body very much. Therefore, he was not able to attain to success in Yoga.\n\n**The Dangers of Excessive Austerity**\n--------------------------------------\n\nToo much of austerity is not necessary for Self-realisation. This is condemned by the Lord in chapter XVII, verses 5 and 6. Austerity should not mean self-torture. Then it becomes diabolical.\n\n**The Wise Approach to Austerity**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Buddi Yoga of Krishna is a wise approach to austerity. Some aspirants take asceticism as the goal, it is only the means but not the end.\n\n**The Importance of Moderation**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe nervous system is extremely sensitive. It responds even to very slight changes and causes distraction of the mind. Therefore, it is very necessary that you should lead a very regulated and disciplined life and should be moderate in food, sleep, and recreation.\n\n**A Regulated Life**\n-------------------\n\nTake measured food. Sleep at 9 or 10 p.m. and get up at 3 or 4 a.m. Only then will you attain to success in Yoga, which will kill all sorts of pains and sorrows of this life.\n\n**Commentary**\n--------------\n\nIn this verse, the Lord prescribes for the student of Yoga: diet, recreation, and the like. The student of Yoga should always adopt the happy medium or the middle course.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe Lord's words are a wise approach to austerity. By adopting moderation in all aspects of life, one can attain success in Yoga and kill all sorts of pains and sorrows."

Therefore, you should completely abandon all desires without reservation.\n\n**The Origin of Desire**\n\nDesire is born of imagination (Sankalpa). Therefore, destroy the Sankalpa first. If the imagination is annihilated first, then the desires will die by themselves.\n\n**Controlling the Senses**\n\n* All the senses must be controlled from all sides by the mind.\n* Even if one sense is turbulent in one direction, it will distract the mind often and often.\n* The senses will be absorbed in the mind by the constant practice of abstraction (Pratyahara).\n* Then, the mind will not think of the objects of sense pleasure and will become perfectly calm.\n\n**Cultivating Discrimination and Dispassion**\n\nThat mind which is endowed with a strong discrimination and dispassion will be able to control the whole ground (or group) of the senses from their objects in all directions.\n\nTherefore, cultivate strong Viveka or discrimination between the Real and the unreal and also Vairagya or total dispassion for sensual pleasures.\n\n**Cf.

He scrapes all the sins? evils? and the causes of evil from the hearts of His devotees. Therefore He is called Krishna.\n\n### The Turbulent Nature of the Mind\n\nThe mind is not only restless but also turbulent or impetuous? strong and obstinate. It produces violent agitation in the body and the senses.\n\n#### The Five Senses\nThe mind is drawn by the objects in all directions. It works always in conjunction with the five senses. It is drawn by them to the five kinds of objects.\n\n### The Restlessness of the Mind\n\nTherefore it is ever restless. It enjoys the five kinds of sensobjects with the help of these senses and the body. Therefore it makes them subject to external influences.\n\n#### The Difficulty of Controlling the Mind\nIt is even more difficult to control it than to control the wind.\n\n### The Birth of the Mind\nThe mind is born of Vayutanmatra (wind root element). That is the reason why it is as restless as the wind.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe mind's constant changes and turbulent nature make it difficult to control. Its restless nature is comparable to that of the wind, which is also hard to tame."

This destruction refers to the destruction of their ego, pride, and other negative qualities.\n\nThe Lord is also stating that such a person will not take a birth lower than the present one. This means that they will not be reborn into a lower state of existence.\n\nThe final phrase, \"What will he attain, then?\" suggests that the person who has not achieved perfection in Yoga will not be able to attain anything of value. Their attainments are unknown, and they will not be able to experience the joy and happiness that comes from achieving perfection.\n\n### Disciple-Teacher Relationship\n\nIn Hindu tradition, a disciple is regarded as a son.

    "explanation": "**6.41 प्राप्य: Attaining Perfection**\n\nAttaining perfection is a state that can be achieved by having attained the righteous, having dwelt in the worlds, and having lived an everlasting life. This state is not limited to a long period of time but rather signifies a considerable duration.\n\n**Characteristics of the Righteous**\n\nThe righteous are those who tread the path of truth and perform virtuous actions such as charity, Yajna (rituals), and worship of the Lord. They act in accordance with the prescribed rules of the scriptures.\n\n**Qualities of the Righteous**\n\nThe righteous are characterized by their pure heart, free from jealousy, hatred, pride, and greed. They lead a moral life.\n\n**Interpretation of Everlasting Years**\n\nEverlasting years means only a considerably long period but not absolutely everlasting. It signifies a state that is not limited to a single lifetime.\n\n**Characteristics of the Pure**\n\nThe pure are those who have a pure heart and lead a moral life. They are characterized by their absence of jealousy, hatred, pride, and greed.\n\n**Commentary on Yogabhrashta**\n\nYogabhrashta refers to one who has fallen from Yoga. This can be due to various reasons such as lack of dispassion or slackness in the practice, leading one to become a victim of Maya (illusion) and their turbulent senses. On the other hand, Yogabhrashta can also refer to one who was not able to attain perfection in Yoga or climbed a certain height on the ladder of Yoga but fell down due to lack of dispassion or slackness in practice.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Attaining perfection is a state that can be achieved by having attained the righteous.\n* The righteous are those who tread the path of truth and perform virtuous actions.\n* Everlasting years mean only a considerably long period but not absolutely everlasting.\n* The pure are those who have a pure heart and lead a moral life.\n* Yogabhrashta refers to one who has fallen from Yoga due to lack of dispassion or slackness in practice."

The birth in a family of wise Yogis is not just a physical event, but also a spiritual one.

Tam that?\n\nWhen he takes a human body again in this world, his previous exertions and practice in the path of Yoga are not wasted. They bear full fruit now, and hasten his moral and spiritual evolution.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Previous efforts in Yoga are not lost when reborn.\n*   They contribute to spiritual growth and development.\n\n### Subconscious Mind\n\nOur thoughts and actions are left in our subconscious minds in the form of subtle Samskaras or impressions. Our experiences, habits, and tendencies are also stored up in our subconscious mind.\n\n### Revival of Past Samskaras\n\nThe Samskaras of the past birth are revivified and reenergised in the next birth. The Samskaras of Yogic practices and meditation, as well as the Yogic tendencies, will compel the spiritual aspirant to strive with greater vigour than that with which he attempted in the former birth.\n\n### Increased Effort\n\nHe will endeavour more strenuously to get more spiritual experiences and to attain to higher planes of realisation than those acquired in his previous birth.\n\n### Quote\n\n\"O son of the Kurus,\" the Bhagavad Gita says, \"your efforts will not be in vain.\" The teachings of the Bhagavad Gita emphasize the importance of perseverance and dedication to spiritual growth."

By the force of the Samskaras of the practice of Yoga, though he may not be conscious of them and even if he may not be willing to adopt the course of Yogic discipline on account of the force of some evil Karma.\n\n#### If He Had Not Done Any Great Evil Action\n\nIf he had not done any great evil action which could overwhelm his Yogic tendencies, he will certainly continue his Yogic practices in this birth very vigorously through the force of the Yogic Samskaras created by his Yogic practices in his previous birth.\n\n#### If the Force of Evil Action is Stronger\n\nIf the force of the evil action is stronger, the Yogic tendencies will be overpowered or suppressed for some time. As soon as the fruits of the evil actions are exhausted, the force of the Yogic Samskaras will begin to manifest itself. He will start his Yogic practices vigorously and attain the final beatitude of life.\n\n### Even an Enirer in Whom a Desire for Information about Yoga is Kindled\n\nEven an enirer in whom a desire for information about Yoga is kindled goes beyond the Brahmic word? i.e.? the Vedas. He rises superior to the performer of the Vedic rituals and ceremonies. He is beyond the entanglement of forms and ceremonies. He is not satisfied with mere ritualism. He thirsts for a satisfaction higher than that given by the sensual objects.\n\n#### Freeing Himself from SabdaBrahma\n\nHe who simply wishes to know the nature of the principles of Yoga frees himself from the SabdaBrahma? i.e.? from the effects of the Vedic rituals and ceremonies.\n\n#### A Real Practitioner or Knower of Yoga\n\nIf this be the case of a simple enirer? how much more exalted should be the condition of a real practitioner or knower of Yoga or of one who is established in Nirvikalpa Samadhi? He will be absolutely free from the effects of the Vedic rituals and ceremonies. He will enjoy the eternal bliss and the everlasting peace of the Eternal.\n\n### An Aspirant Who is Desirous of Obtaining Moksha Alone\n\nAn aspirant who is desirous of obtaining Moksha alone is not affected by the sin of nonperformance of action even if he renounces all the obligatory and optional or occasional duties. He goes beyond the word of Brahman (the scripture or the Vedas).\n\n#### Without Any Spiritual Inclinations or Samskaras\n\nWhen such is the case of an aspirant who is without any spiritual inclinations or Samskaras of the previous birth? how much more exalted will be the state of that student who has done Yogic practices in his previous birth? Who has fallen from Yoga in his previous birth? And who has taken up Yoga in this birth? Renouncing all the worldly activities.\n\n#### Impelled by Strong Desire for Liberation\n\nImpelled by the strong desire for liberation, he practises rigorous Sadhana in this birth. He is constrained? as it were? by the force of the good Samskaras of his previous birth to take to Yogic practices in spite of himself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this verse, the Lord lays stress on the fact that no effort in the practice of Yoga goes in vain. Even the smallest effort will have its effect sooner or later in this birth or another. Therefore, there is no cause for disappointment even for the dullest type of spiritual aspirant."

This process is gradual, with the yogi gaining experiences little by little.\n\n### The Journey to Perfection\n\nThe yogi's journey is one of self-discovery and growth. Through his efforts, he becomes purified from sins (संशुद्धकिल्बिषः) and eventually attains to perfection.\n\n### The Final Goal\n\nThe ultimate goal of the yogi's journey is to attain knowledge of the Self (तु) and reach the highest path (पराम्), which is the final beatitude of life (गतिम्). This knowledge and understanding bring a sense of completion and fulfillment.\n\n### The Beatitude of Life\n\nThe final beatitude of life is one of profound understanding and acceptance. It is the culmination of the yogi's journey, where he has gained experiences little by little and has attained to perfection.

Let's explore these terms and their meanings.\n\n**Yogi: The Supreme Being**\n\n*   **Tapasvi:** One who observes the austerities of speech, mind, and body prescribed in chapter XVII. 14-16.\n*   **Jnani:** One who has a knowledge of the scriptures (an indirect knowledge or theoretical knowledge of the Self).\n*   **Karmi:** He who performs the Vedic rituals.\n\n**Comparison of Terms**\n\n| Term | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Yogi | The superior being who has the direct knowledge of the Self through intuition or direct cognition through Nirvikalpa Samadhi. |\n| Jnani | One who has a knowledge of the scriptures, but lacks direct experience of the Self. |\n| Karmi | He who performs the Vedic rituals, but may not have a deep understanding of the Self. |\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Yogi is considered superior to both Jnani and Karmi due to his direct knowledge of the Self. However, it's essential to note that each individual has their unique path to spiritual realization, and the Yogi is not necessarily superior in all aspects. The Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the importance of individual effort and dedication to spiritual growth, regardless of one's level of realization."

Tanmatras are the subtle root-elements.\n\n### Representation of Elements\n\nIn this verse, earth, water, fire, air, and ether represent the subtle or rudimentary elements out of which the five gross elements are formed.\n\n### The Avyaktam and Ahamkara\n\nMind stands here for its cause, Ahamkara. Intellect for its cause, the Mahat Ahamkara. The Avyaktam or the unmanifested (Mula Prakriti) is united with Avidya, which is conjoined with all kinds of Vasanas or latent tendencies.\n\n### The Unity of Ahamkara and Avyaktam\n\nAs Ahamkara (Iness) is the cause for all the actions of every individual and as Ahamkara is the most vital principle in man on which all the other Tattvas or principles depend, the Avyaktam combined with the Ahamkara is itself called here Ahamkara. Just as food which is mixed with poison is itself called poison.\n\n### The Significance of Ahamkara\n\nAhamkara (Iness) is the cause for all the actions of every individual. It is the most vital principle in man on which all the other Tattvas or principles depend. The Ahamkara is the root of all existence and is the source of all actions.\n\n### The Relationship Between Ahamkara and Avyaktam\n\nThe Ahamkara is united with the Avyaktam, which represents the unmanifested or unconscious aspect of nature. This union gives rise to the manifestation of the Ahamkara, which is the source of all actions and existence.\n\n### The Fivefold Mixing\n\nThe five gross elements are formed through the process of Pancikarana or fivefold mixing. This process involves the combination of the Tanmatras, which are the subtle root-elements.\n\n### The Nature of Apara Prakriti\n\nApara Prakriti represents the inferior Nature, which is composed of the five gross elements. This Nature is formed through the process of Pancikarana or fivefold mixing and is characterized by its gross and material nature.\n\n### The Relationship Between Ahamkara and Intellect\n\nAhamkara is the cause for all the actions of every individual, while intellect is its cause. This relationship highlights the importance of Ahamkara as the fundamental principle of existence and action.\n\n### The Significance of Vasanas\n\nVasanas or latent tendencies are conjoined with the Avyaktam, which represents the unmanifested or unconscious aspect of nature. These tendencies play a crucial role in shaping the actions and existence of individuals.\n\n### The Unity of Ahamkara, Avyaktam, and Avidya\n\nThe Ahamkara is united with the Avyaktam, which is conjoined with Avidya. This union gives rise to the manifestation of the Ahamkara, which is the source of all actions and existence."

The whole universe originates from Me and dissolves in Me.\n\n### The Nature of Brahman\n\nIn the Brahma Sutras (chapter 1, section 1, aphorism 2) it is said:\n\nJanmadyasya yatah\nmeaning that Brahman is that omniscient and omnipotent cause from which proceed the origin, subsistence, and dissolution of this world.\n\n### The Nature of Isvara\n\nJust as the mind is the material cause and also the seer (Drashta) for the objects seen in a dream, so also Isvara is the material cause of this world (UpadanaKarana) and also the seer (Drashta). He is also the efficient or the instrumental cause (NimittaKarana).\n\n**Cf.

The illustration of gems and thread illustrates only the idea that all beings and the whole world are threaded on the Lord.

It is essential to understand that in Hindu philosophy, particularly in the context of the Bhagavad Gita, the term \"seed\" is used to describe the fundamental nature of reality.\n\n### The Lord's Response\n\nHad Arjuna asked, \"Who is the seed for Thee?\" the Lord would have replied. This response highlights the Lord's understanding of Arjuna's question and provides insight into his nature.\n\n### The Nature of the Seed\n\nThe seed, in this context, refers to the ultimate reality or the supreme being. The Lord's response indicates that there is no seed for him, implying that he is the source of everything and has no cause.\n\n### The Concept of Causelessness\n\nThe Lord states, \"I am the source of everything. I am the causeless Cause.\" This phrase emphasizes his understanding of himself as a being beyond causality. He is not bound by the concept of cause and effect, which is a fundamental aspect of the universe.\n\n### The Primeval Being\n\nThe final phrase, \"I am the primeval Being,\" underscores the Lord's understanding of himself as an eternal and unchanging entity.

    "explanation": "**The Three Gunas: A World of Duality**\n=====================================\n\n### The Concept of the Three Gunas\n\nThe three Gunas, or alities, are the fundamental principles that govern the universe. They are Sattva (purity), Rajas (passion), and Tamas (inertia). All sentient and insentient objects are composed of these three alities, which determine their characteristics and properties.\n\n### The Predominance of the Three Gunas\n\nThe three Gunas are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. Each Gunia predominates in different beings and objects.\n\n#### Sattva: Purity\nSattva is predominant in the gods, sages, and those who consume milk and green gram.\n\n#### Rajas: Passion\nRajas is predominant in Gandharvas (a class of celestials), kings, warriors, and those who consume chillies.\n\n#### Tamas: Inertia\nTamas is predominant in demons, Sudras, garlic, onion, and meat.\n\n### The Relationship Between the Individual and the Three Gunas\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThough beings and objects are composed of the three Gunas, they do not belong to them. The individual is independent and separate from these Gunas.\n\n**I am not in them, they are in Me.**\n------------------------------------\n\nJust as the superimposed snake depends on the rope, but the rope is never in the snake. Similarly, the waves belong to the ocean, but the ocean does not belong to the waves.\n\n**The Illusion of Belonging**\n---------------------------\n\nThis illusion of belonging is a fundamental aspect of the human experience. We often mistake our attachment to things for ownership, when in reality, we are merely a part of the larger whole.\n\n**The Support System**\n----------------------\n\nI am the support for them, and they depend on Me just as the sun depends on the sky. The universe is a vast web of relationships, and I am the thread that weaves it all together.\n\n**The Ocean Within**\n---------------------\n\nJust as the ocean is not contained within its waves, I am not contained within my individual self. The universe is a vast expanse of consciousness, and I am its essence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nThe three Gunas are the fundamental principles that govern the universe. They determine the characteristics and properties of beings and objects, but they do not define our individuality. We are separate from these Gunas, yet we are inextricably linked to them. The universe is a vast web of relationships, and I am its support system."

The Lord, who is the indweller of all beings, makes the faith of a devotee who worships lesser divinities steady and unswerving.\n\n### Tanu: The Body as a Devata\n\nThe word \"Tanu\" is used here to convey the idea that the body, or more specifically, the Devata (god), is being referred to. This concept is essential in understanding the nature of devotion and faith.\n\n### Bhakti: The Power of Devotion\n\nBhakti, or devotion, is the key to understanding this verse. The Lord makes the faith of a devotee who worships lesser divinities steady and unswerving. This implies that the devotion of a devotee is not limited to worshiping the Lord alone, but also encompasses worshiping lesser divinities.\n\n### The Role of Samskaras\n\nThe faith of a devotee is born of the Samskaras (impressions) of his previous birth. This means that a devotee's faith is influenced by the experiences and impressions he accumulated in his previous life.\n\n### The Nature of Faith\n\nThe verse states that the faith of a devotee is steady and unswerving. This implies that true devotion is not easily shaken, even in the face of adversity.\n\n### Comparison with IV.11 IX.22 and 23\n\nThis verse is compared to IV.11 IX.22 and 23, which further emphasizes the importance of devotion and faith in understanding this verse.\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Tanu refers to the Devata or god, which is used as a metaphor for the body.\n* Bhakti refers to devotion and is the key to understanding this verse.\n* The faith of a devotee is born of the Samskaras (impressions) of his previous birth.\n* The faith of a devotee is steady and unswerving.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this verse highlights the importance of devotion and faith in understanding the nature of the Devata. The concept of Tanu and Bhakti is essential in grasping the true meaning of this verse."

This is another interpretation.\n\nThe devotee who worships the lesser gods attains the objects of his desire, such as minor psychic powers or other finite rewards. These objects are ordained by the Lord only, as He alone knows exactly the relation between the actions and their results or rewards.\n\n**The Folly of Unwise Desires**\n\nUnwise or undiscriminating people only take recourse to the means of getting these finite rewards, which can hardly give entire satisfaction. This is a pitiable lot indeed.\n\n**The Limits of Human Understanding**\n\nThey have no power of inquiry (VicharaSakti) or right understanding. As a result, they get hold of pieces of glass instead of attaining the jewel of the Self, which is of incalculable value.\n\n**The True Nature of Spiritual Pursuits**\n\nThose who worship the lesser gods and attain these finite rewards are, in reality, only scratching the surface of their true potential. They are not attaining the Self, which is the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit.\n\n**The Ordinance of the Lord**\n\nThese objects are ordained by the Lord only, as He is the Inner Ruler of all beings. His understanding and knowledge are beyond human comprehension, and it is only He who can truly guide us towards our ultimate goal.\n\n**The Pitfalls of Unwise Desires**\n\nPitiable indeed is the lot of those who are driven by unwise desires and seek to attain finite rewards. They are missing the mark, and their pursuit is ultimately futile.\n\n**The Value of Self-Realization**\n\nThe jewel of the Self, which is the ultimate goal of spiritual pursuit, is of incalculable value. It is a treasure that lies beyond the reach of human understanding, but it is the key to true fulfillment and happiness."

The reward obtained by men of small understanding and petty intellect who worship the minor deities is small, perishable, and temporary.\n\n**Types of Devotees**\n\n*   **Sattvic Devotees**: Those who worship Indra and others are Sattvic devotees. They possess a higher level of consciousness and understanding.\n*   **Rajasic Devotees**: Those who worship Yakshas and Rakshasas (demoniacal beings) are Rajasic devotees. They are driven by desires and ego, which can lead to further entrapment.\n*   **Tamasic Devotees**: Those who worship the Bhutas and Pretas (discarnate spirits) are Tamasic devotees. They are trapped in the cycle of birth and death, with no hope of liberation.\n\n**The Limitations of Partial Knowledge**\n\nThe knowledge of those who worship the small deities is partial and incomplete.

    "explanation": "**Brahman: The Imperishable**\n=====================================\n\n### What is Brahman?\n\nIs Brahman imperishable? Is it Brahman that is the Supreme Being? The answer lies in understanding the nature of Brahman. According to ancient texts, Brahman is imperishable, immutable, eternal, self-existent, and self-luminous. It is the source, root, and womb of everything.\n\n### The Nature of Brahman\n\nIn its essential nature or Svabhava, Brahman is Adhyatma. This means that it is the innermost Self (the Pratyagatma) dwelling in each individual body. As Yajnavalkya, a great sage of the Upanishadic period, said:\n\n\"Heaven and earth stand upheld in their places. The Brahmanas call this (Brahman) the Akshara (the imperishable). It is neither red nor white. It is not shadow, nor darkness, nor air. It is not ether, without adhesion, without smell, without eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind, without light, without breath, without a mouth or door. It has nothing within and nothing outside. It does not consume anything, nor does anyone consume It.\"\n\n### The Supreme Brahman\n\nAkshara here refers to the Supreme Brahman, not the holy word Om or the Avyakta (the unmanifested source of all that is in Nature). There is Laya (absorption) for Om, and there is destruction for the unmanifested Nature also. Therefore, Brahman is indeed the Akshara, the Imperishable, and the Supreme Being.\n\n### Karma: The Sacrificial Act\n\nOffering all virtuous work. The sacrificial act which consists of offering cooked rice cakes, etc., to the gods and which causes the genesis and support of beings is called Karma. The oblations in the sacrifice assume a subtle form and reach the sphere of the sun. Through the sun, there is rain, and various sorts of grains, vegetables, and fruits crop up. The living beings (Bhutas) live and develop on account of rice and other foodstuffs. Therefore, Yajnas are the cause of the genesis and support of all beings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Brahman is indeed the imperishable, immutable, eternal, self-existent, and self-luminous source of all that is in Nature. Its essential nature or Svabhava is Adhyatma, and it is the innermost Self dwelling in each individual body. The sacrificial act of Karma plays a crucial role in the genesis and support of beings, and Brahman is the Supreme Being that governs it all."

He constantly thought of his Lord and assumed a form eal to that of the Lord.\n* Raja Jadabharata thought of his pet deer at the time of his death and so he took the birth of a deer.\n\n**The Nature of Man**\n\nEvery man has a definite outlook on life?\ndefinite mode of thinking?\ndefinite cravings?\ndesires and hopes?\ndefinite character?\ntemperament?\ntaste?\ndisposition and attitude.\n\nThis is all due to the impressions which have become part and parcel of his subconsciousness.\nThis is all due to experiences which have left their indelible impressions on his mind.\n\n**The External World**\n\nHe always thinks of his body and physical needs.\nHe searches for his happiness in the external?\nperishable objects.\nHe identifies himself with the perishable body.\nHe ignores his innermost?\nallblissful?\nimmortal Self?\nthe source of everything.\n\n**The Yogic Discipline**\n\nHe trains his body?\nsenses?\nmind and intellect in worldly pursuits.\nHe ignores the Yogic discipline of the mind and the senses.\nTherefore he always thinks of his body?\nbread?\ndrink and clothing.\n\n**The Storehouse of Impressions**\n\nDesires are endless.\nTherefore man cannot gratify them in one birth.\nAt the time of death the whole storehouse of impressions and desires is churned out and the most prominent?\nthe strongest and cherished desire comes to the surface of the mind or the field of mental consciousness.\n\n**The Author of Destiny**\n\nYou yourself are the author of your own destiny.\nYou yourself are responsible for your thoughts?\ncharacter?\nfeelings?\nactions and experiences.\n\nYou planted certain worldly desires and Samskaras in your subconscious mind?\nand allowed them to germinate and grow.\n\n**The Power of Meditation**\n\nHe who practises constant and profound meditation on the Self of his own tutelary deity throughout his life will be able to meet death with an unruffled mind.\nHe alone would go to the Supreme?\nthinking of It at the time of his departure from this world?\n\n**Exclusive Devotion**\n\nYou should have exclusive devotion to God.\nYour whole mind must be absorbed in Him.\nYou should not allow any outside worldly impressions?\nwherein there is an iota of selfish desire?\nto sink into your subconscious mind.\n\nThen you can think of the Lord exclusively at the time of death and enter His very Being."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Pain at Birth**\n=====================================\n\nBirth is the home of pain or seat of sorrow arising from the body. Study the Garbhopanishad. There the nature of pain is described, i.e., how the child is confined in the womb and how it is pressed during its passage along the vaginal canal and the neck of the womb or uterus.\n\n**The Role of PrasutiVayu**\n==========================\n\nFurther, it is much affected by the PrasutiVayu (the vital air which is responsible for the delivery of the child). This PrasutiVayu plays a crucial role in the process of birth.\n\n**The Liberation of Mahatmas**\n=============================\n\nMahatmas (great souls) are free from Rajas and Tamas. Having attained Me, This denotes KramaMukti or gradual liberation. The devotees who pass along the Devayana through the force of their Upasana? attain to Brahmaloka (the world of Brahma the Creator) or Satyaloka (the world of truth? the highest of the seven worlds).\n\n**The Enjoyment of Divine Wealth**\n=====================================\n\nIn Brahmaloka, they enjoy all the divine wealth and glory of the Lord. And then attain to Kaivalya Moksha (final liberation) through the knowledge of Brahman, along with Brahma during the cosmic dissolution.\n\n**The Fate of Those Who Have Not Attained Me**\n================================================\n\nMahatmas or great souls who have attained Moksha do not come again to birth. Those who have not attained Me? take birth again in this world.\n\n**Key Points**\n==============\n\n*   Birth is the home of pain or seat of sorrow.\n*   PrasutiVayu plays a crucial role in the process of birth.\n*   Mahatmas are free from Rajas and Tamas.\n*   Attaining Me leads to gradual liberation (KramaMukti).\n*   Devotees attain Brahmaloka and enjoy divine wealth.\n*   Those who have attained Moksha do not come again to birth."

    "explanation": "**The World of Brahma: A Place of Liberation**\n=====================================================\n\nIn the context of Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Bhagavad Gita, Brahma is described as the creator of the universe and the world of Brahma is considered a realm of liberation.\n\n**The Three Worlds**\n-------------------\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita mentions three worlds:\n\n*   **आब्रह्मभुवनात् (Aabrahmabhuvanat)**: The world of Brahma, which is considered a realm of liberation.\n*   **लोकाः (Lokah)**: The worlds, which are limited or conditioned by time.\n*   **पुनरावर्तिनः (Punaravartinah)**: Subject to return, which refers to the cyclical nature of birth and death.\n\n**The Question of Return**\n-------------------------\n\nArjuna asks Krishna, \"O Arjuna, O Kaunteya, who will not return again to this world?\" (8.16)\n\n**The Answer**\n--------------\n\nKrishna responds, \"Those devotees who practise Daharopasana (a kind of meditation on the mystic space in the heart) and other devotees who reach Brahmaloka through the path of the gods (Devayana) and attain gradual liberation (KramaMukti) will not return again to this world.\" (8.16-17)\n\nHowever, those who reach Brahmaloka through the practice of the Panchagni Vidya (a ritual) will enjoy life in Brahmaloka and come back to this world. (8.17)\n\n**The Nature of the Worlds**\n---------------------------\n\nKrishna explains that all the worlds are subjected to return because they are limited or conditioned by time. (8.18)\n\n**The Path to Liberation**\n-------------------------\n\nTo attain liberation, one must follow the path of devotion and self-realization. The practice of Daharopasana and other devotional practices can help individuals attain gradual liberation (KramaMukti). (8.16-17)\n\n**The Role of the Panchagni Vidya**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe practice of the Panchagni Vidya (a ritual) can also lead to liberation, but it is not a guarantee of eternal life. Those who practice this ritual will enjoy life in Brahmaloka and come back to this world. (8.17)\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, the Bhagavad Gita teaches us that there are three worlds: the world of Brahma, which is a realm of liberation; the worlds, which are limited or conditioned by time; and subject to return. To attain liberation, one must follow the path of devotion and self-realization."

    "explanation": "**The Cosmic Day and Night of Brahma**\n=====================================\n\n### Explanation\n\nDay means evolution or projection or manifestation of the universe. Night means involution of the universe or Pralaya. The worlds are limited or conditioned in time. Therefore they return again.\n\n### The World of Brahma\n\nThe world of Brahma (Brahmaloka or Sattyaloka) is also transient, although it lasts for a thousand ages. When the four great Yugas have gone round a thousand times, it makes a daytime of Brahma and when an equal number of Yugas pass again, it makes a night.\n\n### The Division of Time\n\nAccording to the Suryasiddhanta, years in Kaliyuga (with its Sandhya and Sandhyamsa) consist of:\n\n*   432,000 years\n*   Dvapara Yuga (do) - 864,000 years\n*   Tretayuga (do) - 1,296,000 years\n*   Kritayuga (do) - 1,728,000 years\n\nA Mahayuga consisting of these four Yugas comprises 4,320,000 years. 71 such Mahayugas with an additional Sandhya at the close of 1,728,000 years make one Manvantara of 308,448,000 years. 14 such Manvantaras with another Sandhya at the close of 1,728,000 years constitute one Kalpa of 4,320,000,000 years.\n\n### Two Kalpas\n\nTwo Kalpas make a day and night of Brahma of 8,640,000,000 years. 360 such days and nights make one year of Brahma consisting of 3,110,400,000 years. 100 such years constitute His lifetime of 311,040,000 years.\n\n### The Cosmic Pralaya\n\nJust as the tree remains in a latent state in the seed, so also this whole universe remains in a latent state in a seed form in the Mulaprakriti during Pralaya. This is the night of Brahma. This is the cosmic night.\n\n### The Cosmic Dawn\n\nAgain, the world is projected at the beginning of the Mahakalpa (evolution). There comes the cosmic dawn or cosmic day. This eternal rhythm of cosmic day and night (evolution and involution) is kept up in the macrocosm.\n\n### The Ever-Revolving Wheel\n\nNothing that comes under this ever-revolving wheel of cosmic day and night lasts for ever. That is the reason why the seers of the Upanishads, the sages of yore, lived in the transcendental Supreme being, the imperishable Self, the indestructible Purusha, the supreme goal of life, the highest end of man, which is beyond the cosmic day and night.\n\n### The Imperishable Brahman\n\nJust as seeds that are fried can hardly germinate, so also those who have attained to the imperishable Brahman, the Absolute, the Eternal, cannot return to this world of sorrow, pain and misery. They know neither day nor night. They are one with Existence Absolute.\n\n### The Manifested and Unmanifested\n\nThe manifested and the unmanifested dwell in Brahman. Brahman is beyond the manifested and the unmanifested.\n\n### The Destruction of Worlds\n\nWhen the world and the body are destroyed, Brahman is not destroyed. The waves come out and subside, but the ocean remains unaffected. So also the worlds come and subside, but Brahman, the source of everything, the source of Mulaprakriti, ever remains unaffected.\n\n### The Projection and Destruction of Worlds\n\nJust as ornaments come out of gold and then go back to gold when they are melted, so also all the worlds come out of Brahman and go back to Brahman. Gold is in no way affected by the various forms such as earrings, bracelets, anklets, etc. that have been made of it.\n\n### The Unaffected Brahman\n\nEven so Brahman is not in the least affected by the projection and destruction (dissolution) of the worlds and the bodies of beings. It remains always as It is.\n\n### The Transcendental Supreme Being\n\nThe transcendental Supreme being, the imperishable Self, the indestructible Purusha, is beyond the cosmic day and night. It is the supreme goal of life, the highest end of man.\n\n### The Source of Everything\n\nBrahman is the source of everything, the source of Mulaprakriti. It remains always as It is.\n\n### The Unmanifested Brahman\n\nThe unmanifested Brahman is beyond the manifested and the unmanifested. It remains always as It is.\n\n### The Cosmic Day and Night\n\nThe cosmic day and night (evolution and involution) is kept up in the macrocosm.

It remains always as It is.\n\n### The Imperishable Brahman\n\nThe imperishable Brahman, the Absolute, the Eternal, is beyond the cosmic day and night.

Desire is born of ignorance, and man exerts to attain and enjoy the objects of his desires. During this activity, he favours some and injures others through the force of RagaDvesha (love and hatred or attraction and repulsion).\n\n**The Wheel of Samsara**\n------------------------\n\nHe is caught in the wheel of Samsara or transmigration. He has to take birth again and again to reap the fruits of his own actions. He repeatedly comes forths and dissolves through the force of his own Karma.\n\n### The Sorrowful State of the Individual Souls\n\nThe individual souls have lost their independence as they are bound by ignorance, desire, and activity. Therefore, they are subject to the sorrows, miseries, and pains of this Samsara.\n\n**The Lord's Message**\n---------------------\n\nIn order to create dispassion in their minds and a longing for liberation in their hearts, and to remove the fallacious belief that a man reaps the fruits of what he has not done or that he does not reap the fruits of what he has done, the Lord has said:\n\n> **\"All creatures involuntarily come into being again and again at the coming of the day and dissolve at the coming of the night (on account of the actions or Karmas caused by desire born of ignorance).\"**\n\n### The Cycle of Birth, Death, and Rebirth\n\nThis cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is a never-ending process.

The question arises: \"Purusha? सः that?\" and \"Partha? भक्त्या by devotion?\" to understand the nature of Purusha.\n\n### The Supreme Person\n\nThe Supreme Person, or Purusha, is the ultimate reality that pervades all existence. It is the cause of all effects and the source of everything. Just as an effect, or pot, rests within its cause, so do all beings and the worlds rest within their cause, the Purusha.\n\n### The Pervasion of Purusha\n\nThe whole world is pervaded by the Purusha. This concept is supported by Sri Sankara, who explains exclusive devotion as Jnana or knowledge of the Self. According to him, Purusha is so called because everything is filled by It (derived from the Sanskrit root pur, which means to fill) or because It rests in the body of all (derived from the Sanskrit root pur).\n\n### The Highest Reality\n\nNone is higher than Purusha, and therefore, It is the Supreme Person. This concept is further supported by various Upanishads, such as IX.4 and XI.38.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Purusha is the ultimate reality that pervades all existence.\n*   It is the cause of all effects and the source of everything.\n*   The whole world is pervaded by Purusha.\n*   Exclusive devotion is explained as Jnana or knowledge of the Self.\n*   Purusha is so called because everything is filled by It (derived from the Sanskrit root pur) or because It rests in the body of all (derived from the Sanskrit root pur).\n*   None is higher than Purusha, and therefore, It is the Supreme Person.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of Purusha is a fundamental aspect of Hindu philosophy.

From the year to the sun.\n\n### The Journey of the Departed Soul (Continued)\n\nWhen the person goes away from this world, he comes to Vayu (air). Then Vayu provides room for him like the hole of a wheel and through it he mounts higher. He comes to the sun.\n\n### The Journey from Moon to Lightning\n\nFrom the moon to the lightning, there is a person that is not human who leads him to Brahman.\n\n### Time as the Path or Stage\n\nTime is here used in the sense of the path or the stage on the path. Fire and light are the deities who preside over time. Daytime is the deity who presides over the day. The bright fortnight is the deity presiding over it. The six months of the northern solstice are the deity who presides over the northern path.\n\n### The Path of Illumination\n\nThis is the path of illumination that leads to liberation. The life-breaths of the liberated sages who have attained knowledge of the Self do not depart. They are absorbed in Brahman.\n\n### The Liberated Sages\n\nThe Jivanmuktas who attain KaivalyaMoksha or immediate, salvation or liberation have no place to go to or return from. They become one with the all-pervading Brahman.\n\n### The Progression of Purity and Illumination\n\nEach step may mean a plane or a state of consciousness or the degree of purity or illumination. The more the purity, the more the divine light.\n\n### Bright Objects and Illumination\n\nThere are bright objects throughout the course of the path. There is illumination or knowledge when one passes along this path. Hence it is called the path of light.\n\n### Bhishma's Journey\n\nAfter Bhishma was mortally wounded, he lay on the bed of arrows till the onset of the northern solstice and then departed from here to the Abode of the Lord."

    "explanation": "**The Two Paths of Life**\n\n### Commentary on the Upanishads 8.26\n\n#### The Bright and Dark Paths\n\nThe bright path is the path to the gods taken by the devotees. The dark path is of the manes taken by those who perform sacrifices or charitable acts with the expectation of rewards.\n\n#### The Nature of These Paths\n\nThese two paths are not open to the whole world. The bright path is open to the devotees and the dark one to those who are devoted to the rituals.\n\n#### The Meaning of Devoted\n\nWorld here means devotees or people devoted to ritual. Pitriloka or Chandraloka is Svarga or heaven.\n\n### Key Points\n\n* The bright path is for devotees who seek union with the divine.\n* The dark path is for those who perform rituals and sacrifices with expectations of rewards.\n* These paths are not accessible to everyone, but rather to those who are devoted to the rituals.\n\n### The Eternal Nature of These Paths\n\nThese paths are as eternal as the Samsara. They represent the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth.\n\n### The Paths of Return\n\n* **Anava Ruta** (the path to nonreturn): This path is for those who have transcended the cycle of birth and death.\n* **Aneka Ruta** (the path by another): This path is for those who return to the cycle of birth and death, but with a different perspective.\n* **Avarterta** (he returns): This path represents the cyclical nature of life, where individuals return to the world after death.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe two paths of life represent the different ways in which individuals can approach the divine. While some seek union with the divine through devotion and ritual, others perform acts of charity and sacrifice in expectation of rewards. Ultimately, these paths are eternal and cyclical, representing the complex nature of human existence."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of the Two Paths**\n=====================================\n\n### A Discussion on the Two Paths\n\nKnowing the nature of the two paths and the consequences they lead to is a crucial aspect of understanding the principles of Yoga. A Yogi never loses his discrimination, and this knowledge serves as a compass or beacon light to guide the Yogis' steps at every moment.\n\n### The Two Paths\n\nThe two paths mentioned in this context are the path of the gods or light, and the path of darkness. The path of the gods or light leads to Moksha (gradual liberation), while the path of darkness leads to Samsara or the world, a region of birth and death.\n\n### The Consequences of Following Each Path\n\n*   **Path of the Gods or Light:** This path leads to Moksha, a state of gradual liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n*   **Path of Darkness:** This path leads to Samsara, a state of being trapped in the cycle of birth and death.\n\n### The Significance of Knowledge\n\nKnowledge of these two paths is essential for a Yogi to understand the consequences of their actions and make informed decisions. By knowing which path leads to Moksha and which to Samsara, a Yogi can strive to stick to the path of light.\n\n### The Role of Discrimination\n\nA Yogi who possesses discrimination is no longer deluded by the fleeting nature of the world. This discrimination allows them to see through the illusions and make choices that align with their true nature.\n\n### The Importance of Steadfastness\n\nSteadfastness in Yoga is crucial for a Yogi to maintain their focus and commitment to the path of light. By being steadfast, a Yogi can overcome the challenges that arise and ultimately achieve Moksha.\n\n### A Call to Action\n\nArjuna, the prince of Hastinapura, is advised by Lord Krishna to know the nature of the two paths and strive to stick to the path of light. This advice serves as a reminder to all Yogis to be mindful of their actions and make choices that align with their true nature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, knowledge of the two paths is essential for a Yogi to understand the consequences of their actions and make informed decisions. By possessing discrimination, being steadfast in Yoga, and striving to stick to the path of light, a Yogi can overcome the challenges that arise and ultimately achieve Moksha."

When it is the highest of all things and gives the greatest benefits. All should certainly attain this knowledge.\"\n\nThe Lord replies, \"O My beloved disciple, people have no faith in this Dhrama or knowledge and so return to the path of this world of death. Even if they strive with the help of the means of their own imagination, they cannot attain Me as they are not endowed with the right means prescribed by the scriptures.\"\n\n**What is Faith?**\n\nDharma means law, religion, knowledge of the Self.

It is an unshakable, firm inner conviction that the knowledge of the Self alone can give one supreme peace, immortality, and eternal bliss.\n\n**The Power of Faith**\n\nIt was this strong and unflinching faith of Sri Sankara that goaded him to leave his mother and take shelter under the kind protection of his Guru Sri Govindapada for attaining this knowledge which is the supreme purifier, intuitional, according to righteousness, very easy to perform, and imperishable.\n\n**The Role of Faith in Achieving Knowledge**\n\nIt was the strong faith of Lord Buddha that induced him to have that iron determination which he expressed in these words: \"I will not budge an inch from my seat till I get illumination.\" Faith goes hand in hand with fiery determination.\n\n**The Two Methods of Eulogizing the Knowledge of the Self**\n\nThe Lord has eulogies the knowledge of the Self in the first two verses by the positive method (Vidhi Mukhastuti). He has extolled it in the third verse by the negative method (Nishedha Mukhastuti).\n\n**The Benefits of Obtaining Knowledge of the Self**\n\nThis is Vidhi Mukhastuti. The benefits of obtaining knowledge of the Self are described in the first and second verses.\n\n**The Disastrous Effects of Not Obtaining Knowledge of the Self**\n\nThis is Nishedha Mukhastuti.

They do not even possess an iota of devotion which is also one of the paths that lead men to Me.

It is very subtle and attributes and formless, and so it is unattached (Asanga). There cannot be any real connection between matter and Spirit. Saakara (an object with form) can have no connection with Nirakara (the formless). How could this be Devoid of attachment? It is never attached.\n\n### Supporting All Beings\n\nThough unattached, Brahman supports all beings. It is the efficient or instrumental cause. It brings forth all beings but does not dwell in them, because it is unconnected with any object. This is a great mystery.\n\n### Comparison to Dreams and Vessels\n\nJust as the dreamer has no connection with the dream object, just as ether or air has no connection with the vessel, so also Brahman has no connection with the objects or the body. The connection between the Self and the physical body is illusory.\n\n### Adhishthana or Support\n\nBrahman has no connection whatsoever with the alities or the defects of the objects that are superimposed on the Absolute. The Adhishthana or support (Brahman) for the illusory object (Kalpitam) superimposed on, Brahman has no connection with the objects or the body.\n\n### Example of Superimposition\n\nThe snake is superimposed on a rope.

Let us assume that there is such a Sambandha (relationship or connection). There cannot be connection between all the parts because Brahman is infinite and the elements are finite.\n\n#### Samavaya Sambandha\nThe relationship between an individual Brahmin and the whole Brahman caste is also Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between hand and man? between the leg and the man is also Samavaya Sambandha. Such relationship does not exist between Brahman and the objects or the elements.\n\n#### Tadatmya Sambandha\nTadatmya Sambandha is seen to exist between milk and water? fire and the iron ball. Milk shares its attributes of sweetness and whiteness with water. Fire shares its attributes of brilliance? heat and redness with the hot iron ball.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore it can be admitted that the elements have only got Kalpita Sambandha (superimposition) with Brahman. That object which is superimposed on the substratum or support exists in name only. It does not exist in reality.\n\n**Brahman as the Support**\n\nBrahman is the support or the substratum for this world of names and forms.

They do not really dwell in Brahman. It is all in name only.\n\n### Analogy of Ether and Universal Soul\n\nVayu also means Sutratman or Hiranyagarbha. Bhuta also means the individual consciousness.

They say unto them:\n\n*   \"O Yogi, we are very much pleased with your austerities and dispassion.

Varuna? the Vasus? etc. Even they attain Me? because I am everywhere.\n\n#### The Problem with Vicarious Devotion\n\nBut their devotion is not pure. It is vicarious. Water should be given to the root and not to the branches. If the root is satisfied? the whole tree must be and is satisfied.\n\n#### The Importance of Direct Worship\n\nEven so? if I (the root of this world and all the gods) am satisfied? all the gods must be and are satisfied.\n\n#### The Limits of Knowledge\n\nThough the messages from the five organs of knowledge reach the one consciousness? will it be right and useful to place a sweetmeat in the ear and a flower in the eyes\n\n#### The Function of Eating\n\nThe function of eating must be done by the mouth alone and the function of smelling by the nose alone.

The speaker explains that people often worship in ignorance, using methods that are contrary to the ancient rules. This leads them to return to this world, rather than achieving liberation.\n\nThe speaker then lists various deities that people worship, but notes that even they attain the ultimate reality because it is present everywhere.\n\nHowever, this vicarious devotion is not pure. The speaker uses the metaphor of a tree to illustrate the importance of direct worship, comparing it to giving water to the root rather than the branches.\n\nThe speaker then emphasizes that if they, as the ultimate reality, are satisfied? all beings must be and are satisfied.\n\nThe speaker also notes that even the messages from the five organs of knowledge reach the one consciousness? but it is not clear if this is a justification for placing sweetmeats in the ear and flowers in the eyes.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that they should be worshipped directly, using their own nature as the basis for devotion. They also emphasize that people should recognize them as the Self in all beings, and understand that other forms of worship are also a recognition of their true nature."

As I am the inner Ruler of this world, I am the Lord of all sacrifices (Vide chapter VIII. 4 -- Adhiyajnohamevatra). I am at the beginning and at the end of every sacrifice, yet these people worship other gods.\n\n**The Reason for Ignorance**\n\nTherefore, they worship in ignorance. As they worship other gods without recognizing Me and as they have not consecrated their actions to Me, they return to this mortal world after their merits are exhausted from the plane to which they had attained as the result of their sacrifices.\n\n**The Consequences of Ignorance**\n\nThose who are devoted to other gods and who worship Me in ignorance (Avidhipurvakam) also get the fruit of sacrifice. However, this is a subject of debate (Cf.V.29XV.9).\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* I, the Supreme Self, am the enjoyer of all sacrifices.\n* I am the inner Ruler of this world and the Lord of all sacrifices.\n* Those who worship other gods without recognizing Me return to this mortal world after their merits are exhausted.\n* Devoted individuals who worship Me in ignorance also receive the fruit of sacrifice.\n\n**The Role of Ignorance**\n\nIgnorance is a major obstacle to true understanding and devotion. Those who worship other gods without recognizing Me are essentially worshipping in darkness, unaware of the true nature of reality.\n\n**The Importance of Devotion**\n\nDevotion is essential for achieving spiritual growth and realizing one's true nature. By recognizing Me as the Supreme Self, individuals can transcend ignorance and attain a higher level of consciousness.\n\n**The Cycle of Birth and Death**\n\nThe cycle of birth and death is driven by ignorance and a lack of devotion. Those who return to this mortal world after their merits are exhausted are trapped in this cycle, unable to escape the wheel of suffering.\n\n**The Path to Liberation**\n\nTo break free from this cycle, individuals must cultivate devotion and recognize Me as the Supreme Self. By doing so, they can attain liberation and realize their true nature.\n\n**The Role of the Vedas and Smritis**\n\nThe Vedas and Smritis provide a framework for understanding the nature of reality and the path to spiritual growth. By studying these texts, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of Me and the universe.\n\n**The Importance of Self-Realization**\n\nSelf-realization is essential for achieving spiritual growth and realizing one's true nature. By recognizing Me as the Supreme Self, individuals can transcend ignorance and attain a higher level of consciousness.\n\n**The Consequences of Ignorance**\n\nIgnorance has severe consequences, including:\n\n* Return to the mortal world after merits are exhausted\n* Trapping in the cycle of birth and death\n* Lack of spiritual growth and self-realization\n\n**The Benefits of Devotion**\n\nDevotion, on the other hand, has numerous benefits, including:\n\n* Attaining liberation\n* Realizing one's true nature\n* Experiencing spiritual growth and self-realization"

    "explanation": "**The Power of Devotion**\n==========================\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains the importance of devotion in offering gifts to Him. The verse 9.26 states:\n\n**What is the Significance of Devotion?**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   पत्रम् a leaf?\n*   पुष्पम् a flower?\n*   फलम् a fruit?\n*   तोयम् water?\n*   यः who?\n*   मे to Me?\n*   भक्त्या with devotion?\n*   प्रयच्छति,offers?\n*   तत् that?\n*   अहम् I?\n*   भक्त्युपहृतम् offered with devotion?\n*   अश्नामि eat (accept)?\n*   प्रयतात्मनः of the pureminded\n*   Commentarry A gift? however small?\n*   is accepted by the Lord?\n*   when it is offered with profound faith.\n\n**The Significance of Devotion**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe Lord is satisfied even with a leaf? a flower? a fruit or water? when it is offered with singleminded devotion and pure heart.\n\n**A Glimpse into the Life of Sudama**\n--------------------------------------\n\nYou may recall the story of Sudama, who offered a small bundle of parched rice to Lord Krishna. The Lord was highly satisfied with this offering.\n\n**The True Meaning of Devotion**\n---------------------------------\n\nWas He not satisfied with the small berries offered by Sabari? You need not build a golden temple for Him. Build a golden temple in your heart.\n\n**The Difficulty of Pleasing Indra**\n--------------------------------------\n\nBut it is difficult to please Indra. You will have to offer valuable (material) objects to him.\n\n**The Symbolism of Gifts**\n---------------------------\n\nA leaf? a flower or a fruit are merely symbols. The true means of attaining the Lord is pure unflinching devotion.\n\n**The King's Gifts**\n-----------------\n\nAll the objects of the state belong to the king. If the servants of the state offer with devotion some objects to the king he is highly satisfied.\n\n**The Universal Significance**\n-----------------------------\n\nEven so all the objects of the whole world belong to Him. Yet? He is highly pleased if you offer even a little thing with devotion.\n\n**The Meaning of Asnami**\n-------------------------\n\nAsnami? literally means eat. The indicative meaning or Lakshana Vritti is accept.\n\n**The Power of Devotion**\n-------------------------\n\nAll the objects offered with devotion are accepted by the Lord. However small they may be, they bring immense joy to His heart.\n\n**The Call to Action**\n----------------------\n\nSo, you need not wait for the perfect moment or the perfect gift. Just offer with devotion and see the difference it makes.\n\n**The Ultimate Goal**\n---------------------\n\nBuild a golden temple in your heart and enthrone Him there. He wants only your devoted heart.\n\n**The Final Message**\n----------------------\n\nYou will have to offer valuable (material) objects to Him if you want to please Indra. But with devotion, even the smallest of gifts can bring immense joy to His heart."

    "explanation": "**Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: Verse 10.4**\n\n### Explanation of Key Concepts\n\n#### Intellect, Wisdom, and Nondelusion\nIntellect is the power which the Antahkarana (the fourfold inner instrument) has of understanding subtle objects. Wisdom is knowledge of the Self.\n\n#### Patience and Forgiveness\nPatience is the nonagitation of the mind when assaulted or abused. Not thinking of any harm of evil for those who have assaulted or abused is also patience.\n\n#### Types of Pain\nAdhyatmika pain: Fever, etc.\nAdhidaivika pain: Pain or discomfort from severe cold, heat, too much rain, thunder, and lightning.\nAdhibhautika pain: Pain from scorpion sting, snake bite, and wild animals.\n\n#### Truth and Self-Restraint\nSatyam or truth is veracity. It is speaking of one's own actual or real experience of things as actually heard or seen. There is not the least twisting or exaggeration or the slightest modification of facts.\n\nDama or self-restraint is control of the external senses. It is withdrawal of the senses (ear, skin, eyes, tongue, and nose) from their respective objects.\n\n#### Calmness and Happiness\nSama is calmness or tranquility of the mind produced by checking the mind from thinking of external objects of the senses and by disconnecting it from the senses.\n\nSukham (Happiness): That which has Dharma or virtue as its chief cause and that which is favourable to all beings.\n\nDuhkham (Pain): That which has Adhrama as its cause and that which is unfavourable to all beings.\n\n#### Birth, Nonexistence, Fear, and Fearlessness\nBhavah: That which appears. Sat is Bhavah.\nAsat or unreality is Abhavah.\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe verse explains the concept of intellect, wisdom, and nondelusion. Intellect is the power that enables us to understand subtle objects. Wisdom, on the other hand, is knowledge of the Self.\n\nThe verse also explains patience and forgiveness. Patience is not thinking of any harm or evil towards those who have assaulted or abused us.\n\nThe verse categorizes pain into three types: Adhyatmika, Adhidaivika, and Adhibhautika. Adhyatmika pain refers to physical discomforts like fever, while Adhibhautika pain refers to pain caused by external factors such as scorpion stings or snake bites.\n\nThe verse also explains the concept of truth and self-restraint. Truth is speaking of one's actual experience without twisting or exaggerating facts.\n\nSelf-restraint, on the other hand, is control of the external senses. It involves withdrawal from their respective objects.\n\nThe verse explains calmness and happiness as well. Calmness is produced by checking the mind from thinking of external objects and disconnecting it from the senses.\n\nHappiness, on the other hand, is that which has Dharma or virtue as its chief cause and is favourable to all beings.\n\nPain, on the other hand, is that which has Adhrama as its cause and is unfavourable to all beings.\n\nThe verse also explains the concept of birth, nonexistence, fear, and fearlessness. Fear is that which appears to us, while Sat is Bhavah.\n\nAsat or unreality is Abhavah."

    "explanation": "**The Eight Virtues of Yoga**\n=====================================\n\n### Ahimsa (Non-Injury)\n\nAhimsa is non-injury to living beings in thought, word, and deed. Samata is that state wherein there is neither Raga (like) nor Dvesha (dislike). When one gets pleasant or unpleasant objects, there is neither exhilaration nor depressions. This state of mind is achieved by the man of contentment, who is satisfied with whatever object he gets through Prarabdha. He is satisfied with his present actions and is free from greed, thus having peace of mind.\n\n**Benefits of Ahimsa**\n\n* Contentment makes a man very rich.\n* It annihilates greed.\n\n### Samata (Equanimity)\n\nSamata is the state of equanimity, where one is neither attached to pleasant nor unpleasant objects. This state is achieved by the practice of yoga, where one learns to accept whatever comes their way.\n\n### Tushtih (Contentment)\n\nTushtih is the state of contentment, where one is satisfied with whatever object he gets through Prarabdha. He is satisfied with his present actions and is free from greed, thus having peace of mind.\n\n**Benefits of Tushtih**\n\n* It annihilates greed.\n* Greed makes even a rich man a beggar of beggars.\n\n### Tapas (Austerity)\n\nTapas is the restraint of the senses, achieved through bodily mortification and fasting. The strength of the body and the senses is reduced through fasting, which helps to purify the mind.\n\n### Danam (Beneficence)\n\nDanam is the sharing of one's own things with others according to one's own means. It is the distribution of rice, gold, cloth, etc., to a worthy person in a fit place and time.\n\n**Benefits of Danam**\n\n* It brings happiness to others.\n* It is a way to purify the mind.\n\n### Yasas (Fame)\n\nYasas is fame due to Dharma or virtuous actions. It is the recognition of one's good deeds.\n\n### Ayasah (Ill-Fame)\n\nAyasah is ill-fame or disgrace due to Adharma or sinful actions. It is the recognition of one's bad deeds.\n\n**The Source of All Virtues**\n\nAll these different kinds of alities of living beings arise from Me alone, the great Lord of the worlds. According to their respective Karmas.\n\n**The Importance of Karma**\n\nKarma is the law of action and reaction. It is the principle that whatever we do, will have an effect on our future. By practicing yoga and following the eight virtues, we can achieve a good karma and live a happy life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe eight virtues of yoga are Ahimsa, Samata, Tushtih, Tapas, Danam, Yasas, Ayasah, and Karma. By practicing these virtues, we can achieve a good life, free from greed, attachment, and negative emotions. We can also bring happiness to others and live a life of virtue and righteousness."

The speaker acknowledges that the Supreme Lord has declared himself to be, and therefore, it is only natural for the speaker to desire to see his form. The verse highlights the speaker's humility and willingness to acknowledge the Supreme Lord's power and sovereignty."

It states that Brahman is resplendent, endless, and free from the three kinds of limitations: space, time, and thing.\n\n**What are the Three Limitations?**\n--------------------------------\n\n*   **Desa Kala Vastu Pariccheda**: The limitations of space, time, and thing respectively.\n*   **Space Limitation**: Desa (space) limitation refers to the idea that something can only exist in a particular space or location. For example, you can have apples only in September.\n*   **Time Limitation**: Kala (time) limitation refers to the idea that something can only exist at a particular point in time. For example, the pot is here now.\n*   **Thing Limitation**: Vastu (thing) limitation refers to the idea that something can only exist in a particular form or material. For example, the pot is not a cloth.\n\n**The Limitations of Brahman**\n-----------------------------\n\nBrahman, however, is beyond these three limitations. It exists in the past, present, and future, and dwells in all parts.\n\n**The Endlessness of Brahman**\n---------------------------\n\nBrahman is endless because it is free from the limitations of space, time, and thing. It is not bound by these constraints and can exist in multiple forms simultaneously.\n\n**The Pervading Nature of Brahman**\n---------------------------------\n\nBrahman is all-pervading, meaning it exists everywhere and in everything. It is the ultimate reality that underlies all existence.\n\n**The Self of All Beings**\n-------------------------\n\nBrahman is also described as the Self of all beings. This means that it is the essence or fundamental nature of every individual and everything in the universe.\n\n**Commentary**\n-------------\n\nThe concept of Visvatomukham is a profound philosophical idea that describes the nature of Brahman. It states that Brahman is resplendent, endless, and free from the three kinds of limitations: space, time, and thing.\n\n**The Pot as a Limitation**\n-------------------------\n\nTo illustrate the concept of Visvatomukham, consider the pot. The pot is here now (time limitation), but it was not always here (past). It will also be here in the future (future). The pot is not a cloth, which illustrates the limitation of thing.\n\n**The Saffron in Kashmir**\n-------------------------\n\nThere is saffron in Kashmir only, which illustrates the limitation of space and thing. You can have apples only in September, which illustrates the limitation of time and thing.\n\n**The Endlessness of Brahman**\n---------------------------\n\nBrahman is endless because it is free from the limitations of space, time, and thing. It exists in the past, present, and future, and dwells in all parts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe concept of Visvatomukham is a profound philosophical idea that describes the nature of Brahman.

This poetic description sets the tone for the rest of the verse.\n\n#### A Question of Simultaneity\nThe next line, भवेत् were?, poses a question about the nature of existence.

Kasyapa descended from Marichi and from Kasyapa came all other progeny. Therefore?\n\n*   **The Lineage of the Gods**: Prajapati Marichi and others were the seven mindborn sons of Brahma. This establishes a direct lineage between Brahma, Marichi, and Kasyapa.\n*   **The Descendants of Kasyapa**: Kasyapa descended from Marichi, and from Kasyapa came all other progeny. This indicates that the gods and their progeny are connected through Kasyapa.\n\nMarichi? Kasyapa and others are known as Prajapatis or the gods or progeny.

But as the word has been used here in the singular number it is appropriate to take Brahma as Prajapati.\n\n*   **The Interpretation of Prajapati**: The word Prajapati is interpreted as Kasyapa and other Prajapatis. However, considering the context of the verse, it is more appropriate to take Brahma as Prajapati.\n*   **Brahma as the Grandfather**: Brahma is the grandfather (Pitamaha) of Kasyapa. This establishes a direct familial connection between Brahma and Kasyapa.\n\nBrahma or the Hiranyagarbha is the Karya Brahman (effect). Isvara is the Karana Brahman (the cause for Brahma). Therefore?\n\n*   **The Causal Relationship**: Brahma is the effect (Karya Brahman), while Isvara is the cause (Karana Brahman) for Brahma's existence.\n*   **Isvara as the Great-Grandfather**: Isvara is the great-grandfather of Brahma, indicating a deeper causal relationship between them.\n\nHe is the father of,even Brahma.Isvara has Maya as the limiting adjunct. Maya is His causal body. Isvara has no plane. Maya is in an undifferentiated state. She is in a state where the alities of Nature (Gunas) are in eilibrium.\n\n*   **The Relationship between Isvara and Maya**: Isvara has Maya as the limiting adjunct, indicating that Maya is an essential aspect of Isvara's nature.\n*   **The State of Maya**: Maya is in an undifferentiated state, where the alities (Gunas) are in equilibrium.\n\nWhen the eilibrium is disturbed through the will of Isvara?\n\n*   **The Disturbance in Maya**: The equilibrium is disturbed when Isvara's will is applied, causing a change in Maya.\n*   **The Manifestation of the Gods**: The disturbance leads to the manifestation of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva.\n\n**The Verse \"Thou Art the Moon\"**\n\nThou art the moon alludes to and includes the sun also.\n\n*   **The Verse as a Salutation**: The verse \"Thou art the moon\" is a salutation to Lord Krishna, indicating Arjuna's intense faith and devotion.\n*   **The Boundless Devotion**: Arjuna was not satisfied even if he prostrated himself a thousand times, demonstrating his boundless devotion to Lord Krishna.\n\n**The Repeated Salutations**\n\nPunah? Bhuyah Again. Salutations a thousand times and again salutations.\n\n*   **The Intensity of Faith**: The repeated salutations indicate Arjuna's intense faith and devotion to Lord Krishna.\n*   **The Unwavering Devotion**: Arjuna's devotion is unwavering, even when he prostrates himself a thousand times."

It begins with a question: \"इति thus? अर्जुनम् to Arjuna?\" which can be translated to \"thus, Arjuna?\" or \"in this way, Arjuna?\"\n\nThe speaker is asking if Arjuna understands the nature of reality and his own existence. The answer comes from Vaasudeva, who says \"थता so?\" which means \"thus\" or \"in this way.\" He is implying that the nature of reality is not something to be understood intellectually, but rather it is a direct experience.\n\nVaasudeva then says \"उक्त्वा having spoken?\" which means \"having spoken\" or \"by speaking.\" He is saying that the nature of reality has been revealed to him, and he is now sharing it with Arjuna.\n\nThe verse then asks \"स्वकम् His own?\" which means \"his own\" or \"of his own.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality is not something external, but rather it is a fundamental aspect of his own being.\n\nThe next line \"रूपम् form?\" means \"form\" or \"shape.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality has a form, but it is not a physical form.\n\nThe verse then says \"दर्शयामास showed?\" which means \"showed\" or \"revealed.\" It is saying that the nature of reality has been revealed to Arjuna.\n\nThe next line \"भूयः again?\" means \"again\" or \"once more.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality has been revealed to him before, and it will be revealed again.\n\nThe verse then says \"आश्वासयामास consoled?\" which means \"consoled\" or \"comforted.\" It is saying that the nature of reality has comforted Arjuna.\n\nThe next line \"च and?\" means \"and\" or \"also.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality has comforted him, and it will also comfort him in the future.\n\nThe verse then says \"भीतम् who was terrified?\" which means \"who was terrified\" or \"one who is afraid.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality has comforted him, but it will also terrify him if he does not understand it.\n\nThe next line \"एनम् him?\" means \"him\" or \"to him.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality has comforted him, but it will also come to him if he does not understand it.\n\nThe verse then says \"भूत्वा having become?\" which means \"having become\" or \"becoming.\" It is saying that the nature of reality has become Arjuna.\n\nThe next line \"पुनः again?\" means \"again\" or \"once more.\" It is asking if Arjuna understands that the nature of reality has become him, and it will also become him again.\n\nThe verse then says \"सौम्यवपुः of gentle form?\" which means \"of gentle form\" or \"with a gentle form.\" It is saying that the nature of reality has a gentle form, and it will also be revealed to Arjuna in his future forms.\n\nThe final line \"महात्मा the greatsouled One\" means \"the greatsouled One\" or \"the one with great soul.\" It is saying that the nature of reality is a greatsouled being, and it will be revealed to Arjuna in his future forms.\n\nIn summary, verse 11.50 of Bhagavad Gita is a profound passage that explores the nature of reality, consciousness, and the self.

Why can It not be defined? Because It is unmanifested. It does not have the four alities of manifested beings?\n\n### The Unmanifest\n\nThe unmanifest Incomprehensible by any of the organs of knowledge not manifest to any of the organs of knowledge.\n\n*   Upasana (worship) means sitting near. It is approaching the chosen ideal or object of worship by meditating on it? in accordance with the teachings of the scriptures and the spiritual preceptor?\n*   It means continuous and uninterrupted contemplation of God.\n\n### The Imperishable Brahman\n\nThe imperishable Brahman is omnipresent? pervading everything like the ether. It is unthinkable? because It is unmanifest.\n\n*   Whatever is visible to the senses can be thought of by the mind also. That which can be grasped by the organs of knowledge can be thought of by the mind also.\n*   But the Supreme Being is invisible to the senses and so cannot be grasped by the organs of knowledge and is? therefore? unthinkable.\n*   All thoughts of God ultimately lead the aspirant to iescent meditation.\n\n### The Unchangeable\n\nThe imperishable Brahman is Kutastha (unchangeable). Kutastha means remaining like a mass or a heap. Therefore It is immutable and eternal.\n\n*   Just as the anvil remains unchanged though the ironpieces which are beaten on the anvil change their shape? so also Brahman is unchanging though the forms are changing.\n*   Hence Brahman is called Kutastha.\n\n### Interpretations of Kutastha\n\nKuta also means a thing which appears to be good externally but which is full of evil within. Hence it refers to that seed of Samsara? viz.? ignorance?\n\n*   Another interpretation for Kutastha is that which is at the root of everything. He Who is seated in Maya as its witness? as its Lord? is Kutastha.\n\n### The Immovable\n\nAchalam Immovable? that which is free from change. Therefore the imperishable Brahman is Dhruvam? eternal.\n\n*   (Cf.VIII.21)"

However, if you include it as well, the total number of verses in the Bhagavad Gita will reach 701. Some commentators view this verse as an interpolation.\n\n### The Beginning of the Third Section\n--------------------------------------\n\nWe have arrived at the beginning of the third section of the Gita. Although the knowledge presented in this section is similar to that discussed earlier, there are more details and nuances.\n\n### The Discourse on Kshetra (Matter)\n---------------------------------\n\nThis discourse commences with the aim of determining the essential nature of the possessor of the two Prakritis (Natures): the lower and higher ones described in Chapter VII, verses 4 and 5.\n\n### The Devotee's Knowledge\n-------------------------\n\nIn our previous discussion, we described the devotee who is dear to the Lord from verse 13 to the end. Now, the question arises: What sort of knowledge of Truth should he possess?\n\n### The Answer\n-------------\n\nThe answer to this question is provided in this discourse.\n\n### Nature and Its Three Alities\n---------------------------------\n\nNature is composed of the three alities. It transforms itself into the body, senses, and sensual objects to serve the two purposes of the individual soul: Bhoga (enjoyment) and Apavarga (liberation).\n\n### The Three Words of the Mahavakya\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Gita is divided into three sections, illustrative of the three words of the Mahavakya or Great Sentence of the Sama Veda: Tat Tvam Asi (That thou art). This division is as follows:\n\n*   The first six chapters deal with the path of action or Karma Yoga and the nature of the thou (Tvam Pada).\n*   The next six chapters explain the path of devotion or Bhakti Yoga and the nature of That (Tat Pada).\n*   The last six chapters treat of the path of knowledge or Jnana Yoga and the nature of the middle term art (Asi Pada), which establishes the identity of the individual and the Supreme Soul (Jiva Brahma Aikyam).\n\n### Arjuna's Question\n---------------------\n\nArjuna now wishes to know in detail the difference between Prakriti and Purusha (Matter and Spirit). He desires to have a discriminative knowledge of the difference between them."

It is not the physical body alone that forms the field.\n\n#### The Knower of the Field\nHe who knows the field and he who beholds it as distinct from himself through knowledge is the knower of the field or matter.\n\n#### The Knowers of Kshetra\nThose who know them are the sages."

    "verseNum": "13.3",
    "explanation": "**The Knower of the Field**\n==========================\n\n### The Individual Soul and the Supreme Soul\n\nThe fields are different, but the knower of the field is one. The individual souls (Jivatmas) are different, but the Supreme Soul (Paramatma) is one.\n\n### The Nature of Knowledge\n\nKnowledge is considered to be the ultimate reality. It is the key to understanding the true nature of the individual soul and the Absolute.\n\n### The Delusion of Duality\n\nHe who has the sense of duality will take birth again and again. This delusion can only be removed by knowledge of the identity of the individual soul and the Absolute.\n\n### The Experiences of Human Beings\n\nI am happy, I am miserable, I am the doer of this action, and I am the enjoyer of this experience — these are the experiences of all human beings.\n\n### The Bondage of Samsara\n\nThe individual soul is bound to Samsara and is subject to pleasure and pain. The Supreme Soul, on the other hand, is free from pleasure and pain.\n\n### The Unity of the Individual Soul\n\nIf there is only one individual soul in all bodies, all should have the same experience at the same time. This is not the case, however.\n\n### The Nature of Pleasure and Pain\n\nPleasure and pain are the Dharmas (functions) of the mind only. The individual soul is in essence identical with the Supreme Soul.\n\n### The Knower of the Field\n\nThe knower of the field or the Self is not affected by pleasure and pain, virtue and vice. He is the silent witness only.\n\n### The Ignorance of the Mind\n\nThe ignorant man regards the physical body as the Self. He is swayed by the two currents of likes and dislikes, and does virtuous and vicious actions.\n\n### The Liberation from Samsara\n\nBut the sage who knows that the Kshetrajna or the knower of the field or the Self is distinct from the body is not swayed by likes and dislikes. He identifies himself with the pure, eternal, Absolute or the Supreme Self.\n\n### The Disease of Timira\n\nThe disease of Timira (partial blindness) which causes perception of what is contrary to truth pertains to the eye but not to the man who perceives.\n\n### The Removal of Ignorance\n\nEven so ignorance, doubt, pleasure and pain, virtue and vice, likes and dislikes, false perceptions as well as their cause belong to the instrument (the mind) but not to the silent witness, the knower of the field, the Self.\n\n### The State of Liberation\n\nIn the state of liberation wherein there is annihilation of the mind, there is no ignorance and the play of the two currents of likes and dislikes does not exist.\n\n### The Supersensual Knowledge\n\nJust as heat is the essential property of fire, ignorance could not be got rid of at any time. But there have been sages of Self-realisation in the past who possessed extraordinary supersensual or intuitional knowledge.\n\n### The Nature of the Self\n\nTherefore, we will have to conclude that the Self is ever free, pure, perfect, eternal.\n\n### The Ignorance of the Mind\n\nIgnorance born of Tamas acts as a veil and prevents man from knowing his essential nature. It causes perception of what is contrary to truth and causes doubt or non-perception of truth.\n\n### The Removal of Ignorance\n\nAs soon as knowledge of the Self dawns, these three forms of ignorance vanish in toto.\n\n### The Nature of the Mind\n\nMind is only an effect or a product of ignorance. It is not the attribute of the Self.\n\n### The Wheel of Samsara\n\nThe wheel of Samsara or the world-process rotates on account of ignorance. It exists only for the ignorant man who perceives the world as it appears to him.\n\n### The Liberation from Samsara\n\nThere is no Samsara for a liberated sage. Any disease of the eye cannot in any way effect the sun (the dity presiding over the eye).\n\n### The Nature of the Self\n\nThe breaking of the pot will not in any way affect the ether or space in the pot. The water of the mirage cannot render the earth moist.\n\n### The Ignorance of the Self\n\nEven so ignorance and its effects cannot in the least affect the pure, subtle, attributeless, formless, limbless, partless and self-luminous Kshetrajna or the Self.\n\n### The Nature of the Self\n\nIgnorance does not touch the Self."

Is it a physical field or a metaphorical one? The field refers to the field mentioned in verse 1. It is a complex concept that encompasses various aspects of life.\n\n### The Modifications of the Field\n\nThe field undergoes transformations, changes, and modifications. It is a dynamic entity that evolves over time. The properties of the field are multifaceted, and its effects arise from various causes.\n\n### The Properties of the Field\n\nThe field has several properties, including:\n\n*   **Powers**: The field possesses powers such as the power of seeing, hearing, and other senses.\n*   **Effects**: The field experiences various effects, including the influence of limiting adjuncts like eyes and ears.\n*   **Cultivation**: The field can be cultivated, and it grows wild or is tended to.\n\n### The Field as the Body\n\nThe body is the field. It represents a physical entity that houses the senses, mind, and individual soul.\n\n### The Ten Senses as Bulls\n\nThe ten senses represent the ten bulls that work unceasingly day and night through the field of objects.\n\n### The Mind as Supervisor\n\nThe mind is the supervisor, overseeing the activities of the senses and individual soul.\n\n### The Individual Soul as Tenant\n\nThe individual soul is the tenant, inhabiting the field of the body.\n\n### The Five Vital Airs as Labourers\n\nThe five vital airs (Pranas) are the five labourers that work tirelessly to sustain life.\n\n### The Primordial Nature as Mistress\n\nThe Primordial Nature is the mistress of the field, watching over it vigilantly and possessing the three alities: Rajas (sowing seeds), Sattva (guarding the seed), and Tamas (reaping the harvest).\n\n### The Cosmic Mind as Threshing Floor\n\nThe cosmic mind, or MahatTattva, is the threshing floor where the Primordial Nature separates the good from the evil.\n\n### The Cycle of Birth, Decay, and Sickness\n\nIf the individual soul engages in evil actions, it sows the seeds of sin, manures with evil, and reaps a crop of sin. This leads to the pains of Samsara, including birth, decay, old age, sickness, and the three kinds of afflictions.\n\n### The Cycle of Virtue\n\nIf the individual soul engages in virtuous actions, it sows the good seeds of virtue and reaps a crop of happiness.\n\n### Lord Krishna's Message\n\nLord Krishna speaks highly of the true nature of the field and the knower of the field in this verse, aiming to create interest in the hearer."

The ancient hymns, such as the Rig Veda, have explained this in various ways.\n\n### The Brahma Sutras: A Study of the Vedanta Sutras\n\nThe word Brahma Sutras refers to the Vedanta Sutras written by Vyasa or Badarayanacharya in order to reconcile the mutually contradictory passages in the Upanishads. A study of the Brahma Sutras is very necessary in order to comprehend the esoteric significance of the Upanishads.\n\n### The Sariraka Sutras: Another Name for the Brahma Sutras\n\nThe Braham Sutras are also known by the name Sariraka Sutras because fifteen Sutras in the third Pada of the second chapter deal with the Sarira or Kshetra (body).\n\n### The True Nature of the Field and Its Knower\n\nThe true nature of the field and its knower has also been taught in the Brahma Sutras which deal with Brahman such as:\n\n*   **Atmanyevopasita**: only as the Self, let a man meditate on It. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad?

Mind is Avidya (ignorance). Mind is at the root of all activities.\n\n**The Effects of Mind**\n-----------------------\n\n*   **Desires**: fosters fear and builds castles in the air.\n*   **Egoism**: confers force on egoism and stimulates aspirations.\n*   **Ignorance**: increases ignorance and plunges the senses in the ocean of senseobjects.\n*   **Duality**: creates distinctions and differences.

A proud man possesses at least something, but a man of vanity possesses nothing and yet thinks he is superior to others.\n\nVanity is exaggerated pride. A humble man dislikes respect, honour, and praise. He shuns fame and distinction. He never shows his knowledge, ability, or prowess. He never praises himself.\n\n### Absence of Hypocrisy\n\nHypocrisy is the desire to appear what one is not. A Sannyasi has some virtues and a little theoretical knowledge derived from books. He pretends to be a liberated sage, which is religious hypocrisy.\n\nA man in whom this is absent is simple and modest. He never advertises his own virtuous qualities to get respect, name, and worship from others. He will never disclose any meritorious or charitable act done by him.\n\nHe is free from pedantry and will never sell his knowledge to achieve fame.\n\n### Ahimsa\n\nAhimsa is non-injuring of any living being in thought, word, and deed. He who practices Ahimsa places his feet carefully on the ground and avoids stepping on any living creature.\n\nIf he perceives any living creature in front of him, he stops and turns to the other side. His heart is full of compassion.\n\n### Kshanti\n\nKshanti is forbearance, patience, and forgiveness. This is a true symptom of knowledge. The man of wisdom puts up with everything and is not affected by others' injuries.\n\nHe never retaliates or bears insult and injury calmly.\n\n### Arjavam\n\nArjavam is straightforwardness. The man of wisdom is upright or straightforward, free from cunningness or diplomacy.\n\nHe is frank, candid, and open-hearted. His thoughts and words agree, and he speaks his mind openly to the people.\n\nHe is as simple as a child in his speech. He has a heart as pure as a crystal.\n\nHe never cheats others.\n\n### Service of the Teacher\n\nService of the teacher is devotion to the preceptor, worship of the Guru, and doing acts of service to him who teaches Brahma Vidya or the means of attaining liberation.\n\nAcharya is the Master in whom the divine wisdom is embodied. Service of the Guru enables the aspirant to attain Self-realization.\n\nThe aspirant adores his Guru as Brahman, God Himself. He worships him as Lord Vishnu.\n\nHe superimposes on him all the attributes of Brahman or Lord Vishnu. He realizes Brahman in and through his Guru.\n\nThis is the fruit of devotion to the Guru.\n\n### Purity\n\nPurity is of two kinds: external and internal purity. External purity is cleansing the physical body with earth and water.\n\nInternal purity is cleansing the mind of dirt, attachment, hatred, and other passions by cultivating the opposite positive virtues.\n\n### Steadfastness\n\nSteadfastness is the aspirant's never leaving his efforts on the path of salvation, even when he comes across many stumbling blocks.\n\nThis is steadfastness or firmness. No meditation on Brahman is possible with a fickle mind.\n\n### Self-control\n\nSelf-control is the control of the aggregate of the body and the senses. The senses and the body, which naturally run externally towards sensual objects, are checked and directed onto the path of salvation.\n\nNo meditation is possible in a body where the senses are out of control and distract attention."

He does not even like to talk about them. His senses do not run towards them.\n\n### Indifference to Sense Objects\n\n* Vairagyam: Indifference to the sense objects such as sound? touch? etc.?\n* for pleasure seen or unseen: heard or unheard (for pleasure in heaven? too)\n\n### The Idea of Egoism\n\nThe idea that arises in the mind \"I am superior to all?\" is egoism. Absence of this idea is Anahankara or absence of egoism.\n\n### Reflection on the Evils of Birth, Death, Old Age, and Sickness\n\nOne has to dwell in the womb for nine months and to undergo the pangs of birth. These are the evils of birth.\n\n* The man of wisdom never forgets the troubles of birth, death, old age, etc. He wants to avoid being born.\n\nIn old age the intellect becomes dull and the memory is lost and the senses become cold and weak. There is decay of power and strength.\n\n* The old man is treated with contempt by his relatives.\n\nA sick man who suffers from piles? suffers from weakness and anaemia through loss of blood. A man suffering from malaria gets an enlarged spleen.\n\n* These are the evils caused by sickness.\n\n### Pain and Misery\n\nThe three types of pain or afflictions are referred to in the Introduction.\n\n* Pain itself is evil.\n* Birth is painful. Birth is misery. Death is misery. Old age is misery. Sickness is misery.\n* Because they produce misery or pain.\n\n### The Power of Reflection and Perception\n\nBy such reflection and perception of the evil in these, arises indifference to the pleasures of the body and the sensual pleasures.\n\n* Then the mind turns within towards the innermost Self to attain knowledge of the Self.\n* As the perception of the evil of pain in birth helps to obtain knowledge of the Self, it is spoken of as knowledge."

It has no attributes? activity? attachment or parts.\n\n### Characteristics of Brahman\n\nIt has no relation or connection with anything else? because It is one without a second.

He fills and surrounds this world with Himself. He abides in the universe enveloping everything.\n\nIn the previous verse, it is said that the Brahman Which is to be known is neither being nor nonbeing. One may think that It is nonentity or void or nothing. In order to remove this misapprehension, the Lord says in this verse that the knowable has hands and feet everywhere? etc. It directs the mind and the senses to do their proper functions.\n\nThis is only the manifest aspect of Saguna Brahman (Brahman with attributes). Just as the engine driver drives the engine, so also the knowable or the knower of the field drives the body-engine. It is the Inner Ruler. It is the innermost Self. It is the support, substratum, or basis for this world.\n\nThe existence of Brahman is determined or ascertained or indicated by the existence of the limiting adjuncts? viz.? body, mind, and senses. Because there must be self-consciousness behind their activities. How can you call It nonexistence then?\n\nJust as the rope is not affected by the defects or the illusory superimposed snake, so also Para Brahman (the knower of the field) is not affected by the superimposed world, body, senses, mind, and lifeforce. There is only one common consciousness that is eternal, self-luminous, and all-pervading. That common consciousness is Para Brahman.\n\nThe body, mind, senses, and lifeforce are by nature insentient. But they are moved by Brahman to action. They act on account of the mere presence of Brahman or the knower of the field. (The limiting adjuncts are illusory.) Hence they put on the semblance of consciousness? just as the iron piece puts on the semblance of a magnet when it is in the presence of a magnet.\n\nThe whole world is superimposed on Brahman like the snake on the rope. This is called Adhyaropa. It is sublated by the method (Yukti) of Apavada (negation or denial).\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* The knowable has hands and feet everywhere, directing the mind and senses to do their proper functions.\n* The knowable drives the body-engine, being the Inner Ruler and innermost Self.\n* The existence of Brahman is determined by the existence of limiting adjuncts (body, mind, and senses).\n* Para Brahman is not affected by the superimposed world; it is eternal, self-luminous, and all-pervading.\n* The body, mind, senses, and lifeforce are moved by Brahman to action, putting on the semblance of consciousness.\n* The whole world is superimposed on Brahman like a snake on a rope, illustrating Adhyaropa and Apavada."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Matter and Spirit**\n=====================================\n\nIn the context of ancient Indian philosophy, particularly in the Sankhya and Vedanta traditions, matter and spirit are considered to be two fundamental aspects of reality. The question arises as to whether matter is the primary substance or spirit is the underlying essence.\n\n**The Debate**\n-------------\n\nThe debate revolves around the nature of Prakriti, which refers to matter or substance. Is it the field that gives rise to spirit, or is spirit the underlying essence of Prakriti? The Sankhya philosophy posits that Prakriti and Purusha (the individual soul) are two independent and eternal entities, whereas the Vedanta philosophy suggests that Prakriti originates from Brahman and is therefore not self-created.\n\n**The Sankhya Philosophy**\n-------------------------\n\nAccording to the Sankhya philosophy, Prakriti and Purusha are two distinct entities that are beginningless and eternal. They are independent of each other and self-created. The Sankhya system describes the modifications that occur in Prakriti, ranging from Mahat (the intellect) to the physical body.\n\n**The Vedanta Philosophy**\n-------------------------\n\nIn contrast, the Vedanta philosophy views Prakriti as an emanation of Brahman. It is not self-created and is therefore dependent on Brahman. The Vedanta philosophy also posits that Isvara (the Supreme Being) has Prakriti under His perfect control, and Maya (illusion) is His causal body.\n\n**The Nature of Isvara**\n-------------------------\n\nIsvara possesses two Natures: the superior and inferior. The inferior Nature is Apara Prakriti, which consists of the eightfold division of Nature. The superior Nature is Para Prakriti, which refers to Purusha (the individual soul). Isvara uses these two Natures to cause the creation, preservation, and destruction of the universe.\n\n**The Individual Soul**\n-------------------------\n\nThe concept of the individual soul (Jiva) is central to the Sankhya and Vedanta philosophies. The impressions of virtuous and vicious actions from previous births can cause the experiences of pleasure, pain, fear, anger, etc. in this life. The individual soul is beginningless and eternal.\n\n**The Defects of Kritanasa and Akritabhyagama**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIf one does not accept the beginninglessness of the individual soul, two defects arise: Kritanasa (nonfruition of actions performed) and Akritabhyagama (causeless effect). The former defect refers to the inability to experience pleasure and pain from virtuous and vicious actions, respectively. The latter defect refers to the experience of pleasure and pain without any cause.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, the nature of matter and spirit is a complex and multifaceted topic that has been debated by philosophers for centuries. The Sankhya and Vedanta philosophies offer two distinct perspectives on this issue, highlighting the importance of understanding the fundamental nature of reality."

Tanmatras (root elements of matter)\n\nEach of these is a modification of its predecessor and is in turn the cause of its successor.\n\n### The Functions of the Body\n\nThe functions of the body, including senses, lifeforce, mind, and intellect, are superimposed on the pure Self.\n\n### The Ignorant Man\n\nThe ignorant man says, \"I am black, I am fat, I am hungry, I am angry, I am deaf, I am blind, I am the son of so and so.\" He knows not his true nature.\n\n### The Intellect\n\nThe intellect is very subtle and is in close contact with the most subtle Self.\n\n### The Consciousness of the Self\n\nThe consciousness of the Self is reflected in the intellect, and so the intellect feels, \"I am pure consciousness or Chaitanya.\"\n\n### The Attributes of the Pure Self\n\nThe attributes of the pure Self are superimposed on the intellect.\n\n### Mutual Superimposition\n\nThere is mutual superimposition between the intellect and the Self, Nature and Spirit.\n\n### The Cause of Samsara\n\nThe cause of Samsara is the mutual superimposition between the intellect and the Self, Nature and Spirit.\n\n### Prakriti and Purusha\n\nPrakriti and Purusha are the two fundamental principles of the universe.\n\n### The Conditioned Soul\n\nThe conditioned soul, Jiva, is subject to transmigration and experiences pleasure and pain.\n\n### The Absolute Self\n\nThe Absolute Self, or Paramatman, is ever free from Samsara and is unchanging.\n\n### The Experience of Pleasure and Pain\n\nThe soul experiences pleasure and pain, which is the essence of Samsara.\n\n### The Experiencer of Pleasure and Pain\n\nThe soul is the samsarin, the experiencer of pleasure and pain.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the nature of cause and effect is a complex and multifaceted topic. The Sankhya philosophy provides a framework for understanding the universe and our place within it.\n\n**References**\n\n* XV.9 (Cf.)"

    "explanation": "**13.22: The Nature of Purusha**\n=====================================\n\n### Verse Explanation\n\nThe verse explains the nature of Purusha, which is a fundamental concept in Hindu philosophy. It describes how the soul (Purusha) resides in Nature and identifies itself with the body and senses, which are modifications of Nature.\n\n#### Key Points\n\n*   The soul (Purusha) is seated in Prakriti, which means it resides in Nature.\n*   The soul identifies itself with the body and senses, which are modifications of Nature.\n*   This identification leads to the soul experiencing pleasure, pain, and delusion.\n*   The soul's attachment to the Gunas (alities of pleasure, pain, and delusion) is the chief cause of its birth.\n*   The soul's enjoyment of sensual objects in conjunction with the body, mind, and senses makes it the enjoyer.\n*   Brahman is the silent witness and non-enjoyer.\n\n#### The Role of Attachment\n\n*   Attachment to the Gunas is the cause of Samsara (the cycle of birth and death).\n*   If we add the word \"Samsara\" to the second half of the verse, it means that attachment to the Gunas is the cause of Samsara through births in good and evil wombs.\n\n#### Good and Evil Wombs\n\n*   Good wombs are those of the gods, while evil wombs are those of lower animals.\n*   The human womb is partly good and partly evil due to mixed Karmas (actions).\n*   Purushah prakritisthah means that the soul is seated in Nature, which is Avidya (ignorance).\n*   Attachment to the Gunas of Nature is Kama (desire), which is also Avidya.\n\n#### The Destruction of Ignorance and Desire\n\n*   Jnana (wisdom) and Vairagya (dispassion) will destroy ignorance and desire.\n*   This is mentioned in XIV.5 and XV.7.\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of understanding the nature of Purusha and its relationship with Prakriti. It emphasizes that attachment to the Gunas is the primary cause of Samsara, and that wisdom and dispassion are essential to overcome ignorance and desire."

    "explanation": "**Upadrashta: The Spectator or Witness**\n=====================================\n\nIn the context of the Upanishads, Upadrashta refers to a spectator or witness. This concept is often misunderstood as implying that the Supreme Self is passive and detached from the world.\n\n### The Role of Upadrashta\n\nAs an expert who has good experience in sacrificial matters, the Upadrashta sits by the side of the priests and the sacrificer during the performance of sacrificial rites. He does not take any part in the sacrifice, but rather serves as a silent witness.\n\n### Characteristics of Upadrashta\n\nThe Supreme Self exhibits similar characteristics:\n\n*   It does not act or take any part in the activities of the body, mind, and senses.\n*   It is entirely distinct from them and serves as a silent witness of their activities.\n*   It sits near Nature and silently watches Her actions.\n\n### Alternative Explanation\n\nThe Supreme Self can also be understood as a silent observer who guides and corrects the actions of the body, mind, and senses. This perspective highlights the Supreme Self's role as a benevolent guide rather than an active participant.\n\n### The Role of Upadrashta in Relation to the Body, Mind, and Senses\n\nThe body, eyes, mind, intellect, and Self are all considered \"seers\" in this context. The body is the most external seer, while the Self is the most internal and nearest seer.\n\n### The Supreme Self's Consent\n\nThe Supreme Self gives consent, expressing approval or satisfaction regarding the actions done by the senses, mind, and intellect. This consent is similar to that of a king granting permission to his Prime Minister and other officers.\n\n### The Relationship Between the Supreme Self and the Body, Mind, and Senses\n\nThe Supreme Self appears to be engaged in action when the senses, mind, and intellect work. However, it never stands in the way of their activities.\n\n### The Role of Upadrashta as a Supporter\n\nJust as the husband is the supporter of his wife, the Supreme Self is the supporter of this body, mind, intellect, lifeforce, and senses.\n\n### The Enjoyer: The Supreme Self\n\nThe Supreme Self is the enjoyer of eternal intelligence, which is its inherent nature. Just as heat is the inherent nature of fire, eternal intelligence is the inherent nature of the Supreme Self.\n\n### The Great Lord: Mahesvara\n\nMahesvara is the great Lord, who is the soul or essence of everything and is independent of all. He is bigger than even the sky, making him a fitting title for this concept.\n\n### The Supreme Self: Paramatma\n\nThe Supreme Self is supreme because it is superior to all things, from the Unmanifested to the physical body. It is mistaken for the Self on account of ignorance.\n\n### The Relationship Between the Supreme Self and the Mind and Intellect\n\nThe mind and intellect, which are insentient, move and function in the presence of the Supreme Self. They borrow their light from this source.\n\n### The Nature of the Supreme Self\n\nThe Supreme Self is selfluminous, while the mind and intellect have no selfluminosity. This distinction is also reflected in the Vedas, where the Supreme Self is described as such.\n\n### Lord Krishna's Verse\n\nLord Krishna says in verse 17 of the fifteenth chapter: \"But distinct is the Highest Purusha spoken of as the Supreme Self. Do thou also know Me as the knower of the field in all the fields?\""

    "explanation": "**Commentary on Upanishad 13.24**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Liberated Soul and Nature\n\nOne who knows the Soul and Nature with its alities? whatever his conduct may be? frees himself from the cycle of births and deaths. Such is the advantage he gains from the discriminative knowledge of Spirit and Matter.\n\n**The Nature of Reality**\n-------------------------\n\nHe knows that he is eternal and changeless and that all changes are due to the modifications of Nature on account of its alities. The self through ignorance identifies itself with the body and suffers rirth.\n\n### The Cycle of Births and Deaths\n\nIn whatsoever condition he may be? whether he is engaged in prescribed or forbidden acts (like Indra who killed the Purohita Visvarupa and many Sannyasins)? he is not born again? because the actions (which are the seeds of rirth)? of one who knows the Spirit and Matter? who has gained the knowledge of the Self? are burnt by the fire of that knowledge.\n\n**The Power of Knowledge**\n-------------------------\n\nJust as the seeds that are fried in fire do not sprout again? so also the actions burnt in the fire of knowledge cannot produce new bodies or further births. In his case they are Karmabhasa (mere semblance of Karma). They are not effective causes and cannot produce further births. A burnt cloth cannot serve the purpose of the cloth.\n\n### The Wise Man's Liberation\n---------------------------\n\nThose actions which are done with egoism and desire (expectation of fruits) will produce fruits or results. In the case of a wise man? the seeds of evil? viz.? ignorance? egoism? attachment? etc.? are burnt by the fire of knowledge. Therefore he cannot have rirths.\n\n**The Prarabdha Karma**\n----------------------\n\nWhen an arrow is once sent out from a bow at a mark? it pierces the mark and continues to act till it falls to the ground when the full force with which it was dischared is exhausted. Even so the Prarabdha Karma which has given rise to the body continues to act till the inherent force is fully exhausted? although the sage has attained Selfrealisation through his body. But he is not in the least affected by this? because he has no identification with the body? and as he has identified himelf with Brahman or the Absolute.\n\n**The Liberated Sage's Perspective**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf a carbuncle or cancer arises in the body on account of Prarabdha Karma? he will not suffer a bit as he has risen above bodyconsciousness? and as he stands as a witness of his body. But a bystander or a spectator wrongly imagines that the liberated sage is also suffering like an ordinary worldly man. This is a serious and sad mistake.\n\n**The Liberated Sage's Immunity**\n---------------------------------\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the liberated sage he has neither body nor Prarabdha Karma. An arrow that is placed ready on the bow but not discharged with force can be withdrawn. Similarly? the Karmas which have not begun to generate their fruits or effects can be neutralised or destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. Therefore it is proper to say that the liberated sage is not born again.\n\n**The Liberation of Virtuous Actions**\n--------------------------------------\n\nAs ignorance? the cause of this body? is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self? birth? the effect of ignorance? is also destroyed. As one takes birth through virtuous and vicious actions? a sage will not take birth as his virtuous and visiouc actions (the whole Sanchita or accumulated Karmas of his previous births) are destroyed by the knowledge of the Self.\n\n**The Liberated Sage's Immunity to Karma**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Karmas done by him after he has attained Selfrealisation cannot touch him at all as he has neither egoism (agency) nor desires."

    "explanation": "**Exploring the Paths to Knowledge of the Self**\n\n### Introduction\nThere are several paths to attain knowledge of the Self, depending on the nature or temperament and capacity of the individual. We will explore three main paths: Yoga of meditation, Sankhya Yoga, and Karma Yoga.\n\n### The First Path: Yoga of Meditation\n#### Teachings of Maharshi Patanjali\n\nThe first path is the Yoga of meditation, taught by Maharshi Patanjali. The Raja Yogins behold the Supreme Self in the self (Buddhi) by the self (purified mind). Meditation is a continuous and unbroken flow of thought of the Self, like the flow of oil from one vessel to another.\n\n#### Key Aspects of Meditation\n\n*   **Concentration**: Through concentration, the mind is withdrawn from its senses.\n*   **Hearing and Senses**: The hearing and other senses are kept under proper check and control through the process of abstraction.\n*   **Abstraction**: The mind is made to abide in the Self through constant meditation on the Self.\n*   **Purification of Mind**: The mind is refined or purified by meditation.\n\n#### Benefits of Meditation\n\n*   **Naturally Moves Towards the Self**: The mind that is rendered pure will naturally move towards the Self.\n*   **Not Attracted to Sensual Objects**: It is not attracted by nor is it attached to the sensual objects.\n\n### The Second Path: Sankhya Yoga\n#### Analysis and Separation\n\nSankhya Yoga is Jnana Yoga. The aspirant does Vichara (analysis? reflection) and separates himself from the three alities of Nature: the three bodies and the five sheaths. He identifies himself with the witness (Self).\n\n#### Key Aspects of Sankhya Yoga\n\n*   **Vichara**: The aspirant performs analysis and reflection to separate himself from the three alities.\n*   **Witness**: He identifies himself with the witness (Self).\n*   **Silent Witness**: He thinks and feels, \"I am distinct from the three alities. I am the silent witness. I am unattached. I am nondoer. I am nonenjoyer. I am immortal? eternal? selfexistent? selfluminous? indivisible? unborn and unchanging.\"\n\n### The Third Path: Karma Yoga\n#### Surrendering Actions\n\nThe third path is Karma Yoga, which involves surrendering one's actions and their fruits to the Lord. The aspirant has Isvarapana Buddhi (intelligence that offers everything to God). This produces purity of mind, which gives rise to knowledge of the Self.\n\n#### Key Aspects of Karma Yoga\n\n*   **Surrendering Actions**: The aspirant surrenders his actions and their fruits to the Lord.\n*   **Isvarapana Buddhi**: He has intelligence that offers everything to God.\n*   **Purity of Mind**: This produces purity of mind, which gives rise to knowledge of the Self.\n\n### Classification of Aspirants\nThe aspirants who practice Sankhya Yoga are considered the highest class. Those who practice the Yoga of meditation are considered aspirants of the middling class. Those who practice Karma Yoga are considered the lowest class of spiritual aspirants.\n\n#### Gradual Progression\n\nHowever, those who practice the middling and lowest classes soon become aspirants of the highest class through rigorous Sadhana or spiritual practices.\n\n#### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, each path has its unique characteristics and benefits. The aspirant should choose the path that suits their nature and temperament, and with dedication and practice, they can attain knowledge of the Self."

    "explanation": "**The Supreme Self: A Discussion on Its Nature**\n=====================================================\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn the context of Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, the Supreme Self is discussed as a fundamental concept. It refers to the ultimate reality that underlies all existence. In this discussion, we will explore various aspects of the Supreme Self, including its nature, attributes, and relationship with the individual self.\n\n### The Supreme Self: Beyond Nature\n\nThe Supreme Self is beyond nature. Therefore, it is without alities (qualities). It is Nirguna, meaning devoid of qualities.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   The Supreme Self is beyond nature.\n*   It is Nirguna, meaning devoid of qualities.\n\n### The Nature of the Supreme Self\n\nThe activity in nature is really due to its own alities, which inhere in it. The Supreme Self existed before the body came into being and will continue to be after its dissolution.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   The activity in nature is due to its own alities.\n*   The Supreme Self existed before the body came into being and will continue to be after its dissolution.\n\n### Avyaya: The Imperishable Self\n\nThat which is free from the changes of birth and death or appearance and destruction is called Avyaya.

In this chapter, the Lord gives answers to the estions.\n\n**What are the Alities of Nature (Gunas)?**\n\nThe Lord explains that the alities of nature, or Gunas, are the three fundamental qualities that make up the universe. These qualities are:\n\n* **Sattva** (peace, serenity, and purity)\n* **Rajas** (activity, passion, and movement)\n* **Tamas** (darkness, ignorance, and inertia)\n\nThese Gunas bind a man by creating attachment to the material world.\n\n**Characteristics of the Alities**\n\nThe Lord explains that each Guna has its own characteristics:\n\n* **Sattva**: peace, serenity, and purity\n* **Rajas**: activity, passion, and movement\n* **Tamas**: darkness, ignorance, and inertia\n\n**How do the Alities Operate?**\n\nThe Lord explains that these Gunas operate in a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The attachment to the material world creates a cycle of suffering and ignorance.\n\n**How can one Obtain Freedom from the Alities?**\n\nThe Lord explains that one can obtain freedom from the Gunas by cultivating self-awareness and detachment. The knowledge of the Gunas is essential to understand how they operate and how to overcome them.\n\n**Characteristics of a Liberated Soul**\n\nThe Lord explains that the liberated soul is characterized by:\n\n* **Supreme knowledge**: the knowledge of the Gunas and their operation\n* **Perfection**: the state of being free from attachment to the material world\n* **Freedom**: the state of being liberated from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth\n\n**All Knowledge has No Reference to Chapter XIII, Verse 7-10**\n\nThe Lord explains that all knowledge has no reference to the knowledge described in chapter XIII, verse 7-10. However, it refers to that kind of knowledge which concerns sacrifices.\n\n**The Knowledge that Leads to Emancipation**\n\nThe Lord explains that the knowledge being imparted in this discourse will certainly lead to emancipation. The Lord eulogises this knowledge by the epithets supreme and the best in order to create great interest in Arjuna and other spiritual aspirants.\n\n**Having Lerned this Supreme Knowledge**\n\nThe Lord explains that having learnt this supreme knowledge, all the sages who practised Manana or reflection (Munis) have attained perfection after being freed from bondage to the body.\n\n**After This Life**\n\nThe Lord explains that after this life, being freed from bondage to the body, one attains liberation."

    "explanation": "**The Great Nature: A Cosmic Perspective**\n=====================================================\n\n### Commentary on the Verse 14.3\n\nMy womb is the great Nature. The cosmos is evolved out of His Nature.\n\n#### The Concept of Great Brahma\n\nNature is called the great Brahma for She is the resting place of the five subtle elements and also the Mahat (cosmic mind). She is called the great Brahma because through Her the whole manifestation takes place.\n\n#### The Role of Great Nature in Creation\n\nAll changes arise out of this great Nature. So She has got the name Mulaprakriti or Primordial Nature or the original principle.\n\n#### The Unmanifested and Manifested Worlds\n\nFrom the point of view of the Unmanifest She is called Avyakta. The Vedantins call Her Maya (illusion). The Sankhyas call Her Prakriti.\n\n#### The Three Alities and Their Relationship with Great Nature\n\nThis Prakriti is called great because She is greater than all Her effects. This Nature made of the three alities is the material cause of all beings.\n\n#### The Process of Creation\n\nAs She is the source or cause of all Her modifications and also nourishes all the modifications with Her energy, She is called Brahma.\n\n### The Role of Great Nature in Birth and Creation\n\nI place in it (the Mahabrahma) the embryo of life then all beings begin to come to life therefrom. In the great Brahma or Nature I place the germ or the seed for the birth of Hiranyagarbha and the seed gives birth to all beings.\n\n### The Birth of Beings\n\nThe birth of Hiranyagarbha or Brahma (the Creator) gives rise to the birth of beings.\n\n### The Primordial Nature as a Matrix\n\nThe Primordial Nature is like the clay. She cannot create the forms Herself. She gives birth to Brahma Who creates all beings just as the potter creates various forms from the clay.\n\n### The Two Saktis and Their Relationship with Great Nature\n\nI am endowed with the two Saktis viz. the superior and the inferior Natures (Cf. VII. 4 and 5) the field and its knower. I unite these two (the Spirit and the matter).\n\n### The Influence of Limiting Adjuncts on the Individual Soul\n\nThe individual soul comes under the influence of the limiting adjuncts viz. ignorance desire and action. On account of ignorance (Avidya) the individual soul forgets his original divine nature gets himself entangled in the meshes of desire (Kama) and action (Karma) and revolves in the wheel of birth and death.\n\n### The Role of Great Nature in the Manifested World\n\nThe Primordial Nature or the Unmanifested is a dark matrix with infinite potentialities. It is not a substance. Sound and energy are in an undifferentiated state in It.\n\n### The Relationship Between Great Nature and the Three Gunas\n\nThe whole world gets involved into It during the cosmic dissolution. There is no relationship of substance or ality between It and the three Gunas.\n\n### The Three Alities as a Twisted Rope\n\nThe alities are the Mulaprakriti and the latter is the former in a state of poise or equilibrium. This manifested world of the three alities is compared to a twisted rope of three colours viz. white red and black.\n\n### The Classification of Beings\n\nEach colour represents a Guna. Sattvic is white Rajas is red and Tamas is black.\n\n### The Process of Birth in the Manifested World\n\nWater and the seed coming in contact with the earth produce sprouts which grow into trees. In the womb of Nature the seed develops into the eightfold elements earth water fire air ether mind intellect and egoism.\n\n### The Four Classes of Beings\n\nThere are four classes of beings viz. Jarayuja Andaja Svedaja and Udbhijja.\n\n### The Classification of Beings Based on Their Birth Method\n\nThe Jarayuja is born of the placenta (viviparous). Human beings cows elephants horses etc. belong to this class.\n\n### The Classification of Beings Based on Their Birth Method\n\nIn this variety the five senses of knowledge exist.\n\n### The Classification of Beings Based on Their Birth Method\n\nThe Andaja is born of eggs (oviparous). In this variety the elements of wind and ether predominate.\n\n### The Classification of Beings Based on Their Birth Method\n\nLice come under the category of Svedaja they are born of sweat. In this variety fire and water predominate.\n\n### The Classification of Beings Based on Their Birth Method\n\nTrees that are born of seeds are classified under the head Udbhijja in this variety earth and water predominate."

Tamas is the lowest and the worst.\n\n### The Three Alities\n\nThe three alities indicate the triple mentality. They produce attachment in the individual souls? delude them and bind them down? as it were? to Samsara.\n\n#### The Three Alities inhere in the Mind\n\nJust as the three conditions of childhood? youth and old age are found in the same body? so also the three alities inhere in the mind.\n\n#### The Limitations of the Soul\n\nThe soul gets limited by identifying itself with body and the three alities. It is subject to birth and death and experiences happiness and misery? pleasure and pain? joy and sorrow till it realises its identity with the supreme Self.\n\n### The Nature of Gunas\n\nThe word Guna is usually translated as ality. It does not signify property? attribute or ality? such as the blue colour of a cloth.\n\n#### The Primary Constituents of Nature\n\nGunas are really the primary constitutents of Nature and are the basis of all substances. Therefore it is not proper to call them alities inhering in substances.\n\n### The Importance of Raising Above the Modes of Nature\n\nIf you want to attain freedom or perfection? if you wish to become immortal? you must rise above the modes of Nature. You must transcend the Gunas.\n\n#### The Superimposition of Reflection\n\nEven so the pure unchanging Self appears to be bound by the alities of Nature through superimposition. In reality the Self is ever free and untainted. It is beyond them.\n\n### The Dependence of Gunas on the Knower\n\nThe Gunas which are only forms of ignorance are ever dependent on the knower of the field. They bind? fast? as it were? the knower of the field. They have him as the basis of their existence.\n\n#### The Necessity of Knowledge\n\nA knowledge of the Gunas and their operation is very necessary. Only if you have this knowledge can you free yourself from their clutches.\n\n### The Significance of the Gunatita\n\nMahabaho Mightyarmed with strong and sinewy arms reaching down to the kness. This is a very auspicious sign.\n\n#### The Presence of Gunas in All Human Beings\n\nYogis and sages have such beautiful arms. These three Gunas are present in all human beings. No one is free from the operation of any one of the three alities of Nature.\n\n### The Characteristics of the Gunas\n\nSattva has the characteristic of effulgence. It is also harmony and goodness or purity.\n\nRajas is passion or activity.\n\nTamas is inertia or darkness.\n\n#### Analyzing All Phenomena in Terms of the Gunas\n\nAnalyse all phenomena in terms of these three. Know their characteristics.\n\nStand as a witness of these alities. Do not identify yourself with them. Separate yourself from them.\n\nBecome a Gunatita. You will attain Supreme Peace? immortality and eternal bliss.\n\n(Cf.XIII.22)"

It binds the soul to knowledge through attachment, but it also leads to ignorance and nondiscrimination. To avoid these pitfalls, one must cultivate self-awareness and discrimination."

It is associated with qualities such as inertia, error, indolence, sloth, and sleep.\n\n**Characteristics of Tamas**\n---------------------------\n\n*   Produces inertia, error, indolence, sloth, and sleep\n*   Associated with the veiling of knowledge\n\n### How to Identify the Predominant Ality\n\nTo know which ality is predominant or in ascendance, one can look for the following characteristics:\n\n*   **Discrimination**: When a person is endowed with discrimination, it indicates that Sattva is in the ascendant.\n*   **Sublime thoughts**: When sublime thoughts roll in a person's mind, it indicates that Sattva is in the ascendant.\n*   **Pure understanding**: When a person has pure understanding, it indicates that Sattva is in the ascendant.\n*   **Turns away from sensual pleasures**: When a person turns away from sensual pleasures and moves inward towards the Self, it indicates that Sattva is in the ascendant.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJust as winter has its sway when summer and autumn have gone, just as sleep has its sway when a man is neither dreaming nor waking, so also Sattva has its sway when Rajas and Tamas are suppressed. The Sadhana for increasing Sattva is given in the 17th and 18th chapters. Each ality acts in its own turn at different times, and all three cannot operate at one and the same time. When one ality asserts itself or predominates by overpowering or suppressing the other two, it produces its own effect."

    "explanation": "**14.12: The Characteristics of Rajas**\n\n### Overview\nRajas is one of the three gunas (qualities) in Hindu philosophy, and it has several key characteristics. Understanding these characteristics is essential to recognizing Rajas and its influence on an individual's life.\n\n#### Characteristics of Rajas\n\n*   **Lobha (Greed)**: A desire to possess more wealth or property, even if one already has sufficient.\n*   **Pravritti (Activity)**: Action in general, but often driven by personal desire rather than a sense of duty or service.\n*   **Asama (Restlessness)**: Being agitated by joy, attachment, or other emotions, leading to a constant sense of discontent and dissatisfaction.\n*   **Spriha (Thirsting or Longing)**: A desire for all sensual objects, leading to a constant craving and dissatisfaction.\n\n### Indicators of Rajas Predominance\n\nThese characteristics can indicate that Rajas is predominant in an individual's life. However, it's essential to distinguish between Rajasic restlessness or movements and Karma Yoga (divine activity).\n\n#### Key Distinctions\n\n*   **Rajasic Restlessness vs. Karma Yoga**: Rajasic restlessness or movements can be mistaken for Karma Yoga, but they are actually driven by personal desire rather than a sense of duty or service.\n*   **Analyzing Motives**: To determine whether an individual's actions are driven by Rajas or Karma Yoga, analyze their motives and intentions.\n\n### The Paradox of Activity\n\nMany people believe that being constantly active is a sign of a full and meaningful life. However, this perspective overlooks the importance of stillness and contemplation.\n\n#### The Truth About Activity\n\n*   **Sattva as Intense Activity**: Sattva is not just about physical activity, but also about intense mental and emotional activity.\n*   **The Wheel of Activity**: A wheel that revolves rapidly may appear to be at rest, illustrating the paradoxical nature of activity and stillness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRecognizing the characteristics of Rajas is essential to understanding its influence on an individual's life. By analyzing motives and intentions, one can distinguish between Rajasic restlessness or movements and Karma Yoga."

    "explanation": "**Tamas: The Obstacles to Spiritual Growth**\n=====================================================\n\n**What is Tamas?**\n-----------------\n\nTamas, in the context of Hindu philosophy, specifically Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, refers to the qualities of darkness, inertness, and heedlessness. It is considered a major obstacle to spiritual growth and success in any walk of life.\n\n**Characteristics of Tamas**\n-----------------------------\n\n*   **Darkness (अप्रकाशः)**: The absence of light, symbolizing ignorance and lack of understanding.\n*   **Inertness (अप्रवृत्तिः)**: Extreme inactivity, which can be interpreted as a lack of motivation or energy.\n*   **Heedlessness (प्रमादः)**: A state of being unaware or indifferent to one's duties and responsibilities.\n*   **Delusion (मोहः)**: The state of being deceived or misled by one's own thoughts and perceptions.\n\n**Effects of Tamas**\n-------------------\n\nTamas is considered a major stumbling block to spiritual progress. It can lead to:\n\n*   **Forgetfulness of duties**: The inability to remember and fulfill one's responsibilities.\n*   **Confusion into existence**: The mixing of chaos with order, leading to a state of disorder and confusion.\n\n**Tamas vs. Sattva**\n-------------------\n\nPeople often mistake Tamas for Sattva, which is the quality of peace and discrimination. However, Sattva is not Tamas; it's a distinct concept in Hindu philosophy.\n\n**Tamas and Maya**\n------------------\n\nIn the context of Yoga Sutras, Tamas is associated with the concept of Maya, or illusion. It's believed that everything in life is an illusion, and Tamas represents the aspect of Maya that binds us to ignorance.\n\n**Tamas and the Self**\n---------------------\n\nThe individual self, or Jiva, is believed to be Brahman in disguise. However, the Tamas state can lead people to believe that they are Brahman and work less.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nTamas is a major obstacle to spiritual growth and success. It must be destroyed at all costs. By recognizing the characteristics of Tamas, we can work towards overcoming its effects and achieving spiritual growth.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n-----------------\n\n*   Tamas represents the qualities of darkness, inertness, and heedlessness.\n*   It's a major stumbling block to spiritual progress and success in any walk of life.\n*   Tamas can lead to forgetfulness of duties, confusion into existence, and delusion.\n*   It's essential to recognize the effects of Tamas and work towards overcoming its obstacles."

    "explanation": "**The Supreme Self: A Commentary**\n=====================================\n\n### The Nature of the Supreme Self\n\nThe Supreme Self is in no way contaminated by the alities. The liberated sage exclaims, \"I am the witness of the alities.\" This implies that the Supreme Self is not affected by the alities, but rather observes them.\n\n### The Gunas and Their Role\n\nThe alities form the motive power of all actions. However, it is essential to understand that the Gunas alone are responsible for all actions.\n\n### The Distinction Between the Supreme Self and the Alities\n\nI am entirely distinct from the alities. I am pure consciousness.\n\n### The Limitations of the Alities\n\nI cannot be touched by the alities. I am like the ether.\n\n### Realization and Liberation\n\nWhen a man gets illumination or attains knowledge of the Self, he realizes that there is no agent except the Gunas. The Gunas are themselves modified as the bodies, senses, and their objects.\n\n### The Agent in All Transformations\n\nWhen he knows that it is the Gunas only that become the agent in all transformations, states, and actions, he attains to My state (liberation). He becomes identical with Me.\n\n### The State of Gunatita\n\nHe becomes a Gunatita, i.e., one who has transcended the three Gunas.\n\n### Key Points\n----------------\n\n*   The Supreme Self is not contaminated by the alities.\n*   The alities form the motive power of all actions.\n*   The Gunas are responsible for all actions.\n*   The Supreme Self is distinct from the alities and pure consciousness.\n*   The alities cannot touch the Supreme Self.\n*   Realization of the Gunas as agents leads to liberation and identity with the Supreme Self."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Concept of Gunas and Moksha**\n\n### What are Gunas?\n\nThe concept of gunas is a fundamental idea in Hindu philosophy, particularly in the context of the Bhagavad Gita. Gunas refer to the three qualities or attributes that make up the universe and everything in it.\n\n#### The Three Gunas\n\n*   **Sattva**: Purity, goodness, and truth\n*   **Rajas**: Passion, energy, and movement\n*   **Tamas**: Darkness, ignorance, and inertia\n\n### The Embodiment of Gunas\n\nThe gunas are not just abstract concepts but are also present in the physical world. They are the fundamental building blocks of all matter and energy.\n\n#### The Three States of Consciousness\n\nThe gunas are also associated with the three states of consciousness:\n\n*   **Waking State**: Rajas guna is dominant\n*   **Dream State**: Tamas guna is dominant\n*   **Deep Sleep State**: Sattva guna is dominant\n\n### The Concept of Moksha\n\nMoksha, or liberation, is the ultimate goal of human existence. It is achieved when an individual transcends the limitations of the gunas and attains a state of pure consciousness.\n\n#### The Characteristics of a Sage\n\nA sage who has crossed over the gunas is characterized by:\n\n*   **Detachment**: He is detached from all worldly attachments and desires\n*   **Wisdom**: He possesses great wisdom and understanding of the universe\n*   **Compassion**: He is filled with compassion and empathy for all living beings\n\n### The Lord's Response to Arjuna's Question\n\nWhen Arjuna asked Lord Krishna about the characteristics of a sage who has crossed over the gunas, Lord Krishna replied:\n\n\"Just as a river is absorbed in the ocean, so also he who has gone beyond the gunas and attained Moksha is absorbed in Me. He ever enjoys the bliss of the Eternal.\"\n\n### The Significance of Moksha\n\nMoksha is not just a personal achievement but also has far-reaching implications for the universe. It brings about:\n\n*   **Peace and Harmony**: The universe is filled with peace and harmony\n*   **End of Suffering**: All forms of suffering and pain come to an end\n*   **Immortality**: The individual attains immortality and becomes one with the universe\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe concept of gunas and Moksha is a profound and complex idea that has been explored in Hindu philosophy for centuries. It offers a deep understanding of the universe and our place within it, as well as a path to liberation and self-realization."

    "explanation": "**14.22: The Nature of Light, Activity, and Delusion**\n\n### Commentary on Arjuna's First Question\n\nThis is the answer to Arjuna's first question. Light is the effect of Sattva, activity of Rajas, and delusion of Tamas. The liberated sage does not hate them when they are present.\n\n#### When Sattva Shines\n\nWhen Sattva shines, he is not carried away by pride. He does not think, \"I am a very learned man.\" When the impulse for action is awakened in the body or when there is a divine call for him to do work for the solidarity of the world (Lokasangraha), he does not hate any action and he does not regret it after the action is accomplished. He feels no remorse while performing actions.\n\n#### The Work as a Play\n\nThe work is like the play of a child. While inertia increases in him, he is not deluded by infatuation. Only an ignorant man thinks Tamas has entered into me. I am deluded. I am under the influence of heedlessness, torpor, sloth, laziness, and indolence.\n\n#### The Influence of Rajas\n\nNow I am under the influence of Rajas. I am forced to do activities. This is painful. I have fallen from my true nature. This gives me a lot of pain.\n\n#### The Influence of Sattva\n\nNow Sattva predominates in me. I am attached to happiness and knowledge. I am proud of my learning and better status.\n\n### The Liberated Sage's Perspective\n\nThe liberated sage who has transcended the Gunas does not thus hate them when they are present.\n\n#### Longing for Light, Action, or Inertia\n\nA man of Sattva or Rajas or Tamas longs for light, action, or inertia which first manifested themselves and disappeared. But a liberated sage or one who has gone beyond the three Gunas does not at all long for these states which have vanished.\n\n#### The Internal Mental State\n\nThis mark or characteristic is an internal mental state. It cannot be perceived or detected by others. It can be felt by one's own self alone.\n\n#### Clairvoyant Vision\n\nIf one is endowed with clairvoyant vision or the inner eye of intuition, he can directly behold the longings that arise in the mind of another man.\n\n### The Lord's Answer to Arjuna's Second Question\n\nThe following three verses are the Lord's answer to Arjuna's second question: What is the conduct of the sage who has crossed over the Gunas?"

    "explanation": "**The Tree of Samsara**\n=====================\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe countless objects, large and small, which life needs are all products of the five elements through the activity of the alities. This tree of Samsara is nourished by the three alities of Nature.\n\n#### The Structure of the Tree\n\nThe senseobjects are its buds, and the roots which grow downwards are the bonds of Karma for those who lead a life of passion and attachment in this world.\n\n*   **Sprouts**: The charming objects of the senses with their characteristics of sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell.\n*   **Roots**: The Karmic tendencies from the past lives grow downwards to generate the bonds of Karma in the world of men.\n*   **Primal Root**: Ignorance from which arises the eightfold Nature -- the five elements, mind, intellect, and egoism.\n\n#### The Branches of the Tree\n\nEighty-four lakhs (eight million and four hundred thousand) of species came into being.\n\n*   **Branches**:\n    *   **Dharma**: The branch which yields the fruit of enjoyment in heaven.\n    *   **Dispassion**: The branch which yields the fruit of Self-realisation.\n    *   **Svedaja**, **Andaja**, **Jarayuja**, and **Udbhijja**: The four branches that spring from the stem of the tree.\n\n#### The Regions Attained\n\nWhatever regions are attained in accordance with the nature of knowledge or action, they are the ramifying branches of the tree of Samsara.\n\n*   **Regions**: From man down to the immovable objects below and from him up to the realm of the Creator above.\n\n#### The Material Base\n\nThe senseobjects represent the buds that sprout from the branches of the physical bodies which are the products of actions.\n\n*   **Material Base**: The three Gunas, which form their material base, nurture and fatten the branches of the tree.\n\n#### The Highest Root\n\nThe highest root of this wonderful tree is Brahman. The secondary roots are the latent impressions (Samskaras) of likes and dislikes, which spread in this world of men and impel them to perform virtuous and vicious actions and bind them fast to actions.\n\n### Cutting Off the Tree\n\nOnly he who thus cuts his bondage to this tree of Samsara can be happy even in this world. He has the highest wisdom because he stands as a spectator of this tree and knows it as it is, without being tied to it.\n\n**The Path to Liberation**\n-------------------------\n\nTo cut off the tree of Samsara, one must:\n\n*   **Understand the nature** of the tree and its branches.\n*   **Recognize the bonds** of Karma that tie us to the tree.\n*   **Cut off** these bonds through self-realisation and detachment.\n\nBy following this path, one can attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death."

So long as one is under the sway of ignorance, he cannot understand the form of this tree? its end? origin and foundation (middle). O Arjuna, Thou mayest perhaps consider that such a huge tree cannot be uprooted by any means whatever. It is not so. However firmly rooted it may be, it can be cut by the powerful axe of nonattachment or dispassion within the twinkling of an eye.\n\n**The Illusion of the Tree**\n---------------------------\n\nAfter cutting this tree, you will have to look within? meditate on the Self and behold the Supreme. Tatha As such, As described above.\n\n**The Futility of Efforts**\n---------------------------\n\nIs it necessary to pull down castles in the air or to break the horns of a hare or to pluck a flower growing in the sky or to get butter from the milk of a tortoise or oil from stone? Similarly, O Arjuna, there is no reality in this tree. Therefore, why should you entertain any fear as to whether it may be uprooted or not? Its form as such is not perceived by anybody here; it is like a dream or a mirage or an imaginary city in the sky formed by the clouds or caused by a juggler. It appears and disappears.\n\n**The Nature of the Tree**\n-------------------------\n\nThis tree has DrishtaNashtaSvarupa like the mirage. That object which is destroyed when one beholds it is DrishtaNashta. Nobody has perceived the end? the origin or the foundation of this illusory tree. No one can say that it has arisen from such and such a place or point.\n\n**The Root of Samsara**\n----------------------\n\nSamsara or the peepul tree is inveterately deeprooted. You will have to struggle hard to uproot it with its seed or the self-reproducing deep root. Asanga, Dispassion? freedom from attachment to children? wealth and the world.\n\n**The Axe of Dispassion**\n-----------------------\n\nDridhena, Strong. You will have to cut the tree with a strong axe which is sharpened again and again on the whetstone of the practice of discrimination. Further, your mind should be turned towards the Supreme Being with the strong determination that you can attain eternal bliss only in Him and that He is the only Reality.\n\n**The Nature of Samsara**\n-------------------------\n\nThe desire for sensual pleasure is Sanga. Its opposite (dispassion) is Asanga. Renunciation of the three kinds of Eshanas (desires), viz., children, wealth and the world (PutraVittaLokeshana) is Asanga. Just as the axe cuts the tree, so also dispassion cuts this tree of Samsara. Hence dispassion is termed an axe.\n\n**The Annihilation of Egoism and Ignorance**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCutting the tree of Samsara is annihilation of egoism? ignorance? latent tendencies? and renunciation of the fruits of all actions? through the practice of dispassion. Control of the mind and the senses, etc. (Cf.VII.14)"

The Sruti declares:\n\n\"स एष इह प्रविष्टः आनखाग्रेभ्यः तत् सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्।\"\n\nThat Supreme Being Itself, having created this aggregate of the body from the head to the toe, entered this body in the form of the Jiva.\n\n**The Astral Body: A Ray of the Supreme Being**\n\nAccording to Vedanta, a ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature and draws to itself the five senses and the mind. This astral body is a reflection of the Supreme Being in ignorance.\n\n**The Five Senses and the Mind**\n\nThe senses abide in Nature, in their respective seats such as ear, skin, tongue, eye, and nose. The mind is also a part of this collection.\n\n**The Collection of Principles**\n\nAccording to Vedanta, there are nineteen principles:\n\n* The five organs of knowledge\n* The five organs of action\n* The five vital airs (Prana, Apana, Vyana, Samana, and Udana)\n* The mind\n* Intellect\n* Chitta (the subconscious or the unconscious mind)\n* Egoism\n\nWe will conclude that the words \"five senses and the mind\" point to the collection of the remaining thirteen principles.\n\n**Amsa: Not a Particle or Portion**\n\nThis does not mean here a particle or portion which has been cut out. It is like the Amsar of the ether in the pot, where the ether is not cut out but still remains the whole ether.\n\n**The Formation of the Astral Body**\n\nJust as the sun is reflected in water, it is not in any way tainted. When a crystal comes into contact with a red cloth or red flower, it seems to be red but is really not so. Even so, the Supreme Being is not in any way tainted by the actions of the individual soul.\n\n**The Limiting Adjunct: Ignorance**\n\nIgnorance is the limiting adjunct of the individual soul. On account of this limitation, the soul experiences that it is the doer and the enjoyer.\n\n**The Illusion of Difference**\n\nIn essence, the Jiva is identical with Brahman. The difference is on account of delusion or imagination or superimposition.\n\n**The Delusion of the Distinctor**\n\nJivabrahmabhedabhranti (the delusion of the distinctor between the individual soul and the Supreme Being) is removed when the limiting adjunct (mind) is annihilated.\n\n**The Annihilation of the Mind**\n\nIf the cause (ignorance) is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self, its effect (mind) is also annihilated.\n\n**The Return to the Waking State**\n\nJust as the tortoise stretches out its head and feet which were in a state of Laya (absorption) in its body, so also the individual soul stretches out its mind and senses which were in a state of absorption in primordial ignorance in deep sleep, to enjoy the sensual objects in the waking state.\n\n**The Formation of the Astral Body**\n\nA ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature and draws to itself the five senses and the mind.

However, the ignorant and the deluded are not able to behold Him because they are swayed by the alities of Nature. Their minds constantly run towards the sensual objects and are saturated with passion.\n\n### The Role of Intuition in Self-Perception\n\nBut those who are endowed with the inner eye of intuition do behold Him. Yama said to Nachiketas:\n\n\"The self-existent Brahma created the senses with outgoing tendencies therefore man beholds the external universe and not the internal Self.\"\n\n### The Inner Eye of Knowledge\n\nThose who possess the inner eye of knowledge behold that the Self is entirely distinct from the body. They realise the Self's separate existence from the body and know that the body moves and acts on account of Its presence therein.\n\nJust as the iron moves and acts in the presence of the magnet, so too does the body move and act on account of the Self's presence within it.\n\n### The Possibility of Inner Gaze\n\nBut some wise men with their senses turned away from the objects, desirous of immortality, turn their gaze inwards and behold the Self within (seated in their heart).\n\n### The Distinction between Inner and Outer Perception\n\nThose who possess the inner eye of knowledge behold that the Self is entirely distinct from the body.

It allows us to see beyond the external world and behold the Self in all its glory.\n\nBy cultivating this inner eye, we can transcend our limitations and experience a deeper sense of connection with the universe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe nature of Self-perception is complex and multifaceted. It requires a deep understanding of the self and its relationship with the external world.\n\nBy turning our gaze inwards and cultivating the inner eye of knowledge, we can behold the Self in all its glory and experience a deeper sense of connection with the universe."

They are not able to attain Self-realisation.\n\n### The Importance of Meditation\n\nMere study of scriptures alone cannot help one who has an impure mind to attain Self-realisation.

It is not broken down to pieces and it does not sink into the nether worlds.\n\n**The Lord's Penetration of the Earth**\n\nThe Lord penetrates the earth and supports all beings by His energy.\n\n### Rasatmakah Somah: The Watery Moon\n\nThe moon is regarded as the repository of all savours or,fluids (Rasas).\n\n**Nourishing Herbs and Plants**\n\nI? becoming the watery moon? nourish all herbs and plants such as rice? wheat? etc.? by infusing sap into them? and make them savoury.\n\n**Feeding the Vegetable Kingdom**\n\nI feed the vegetable kingdom with My vital juice (Ojas) which pervades the soil and generates sweet juice or sap in herbs? plants and trees.\n\n### The Watery Moon's Role\n\nThe watery or savoury moon nourishes all herbs and plants by infusing sap or savours into them.\n\n**Additional Insights**\n\nMoreover, the Lord's energy is not limited to just supporting the world.

    "explanation": "**Commentary**\n\nNow the Lord describes the three aspects of the divine existence. One is the individual soul called the perishable? the second is the imperishable or the Maya Sakti of the Lord and the third is the Purushottama or the Supreme Being.\n\n### The Three Aspects of Divine Existence\n\n#### The Perishable (Kshara)\nThe perishable comprises the whole world of changing forms. From Brahma down to the tiny blade of grass? all movable and immovable objects? all that can be thought of by the mind? all that is made up of the five elements? all that is changing? all that has names and forms? all that appears to the naked eye and what is described as the body and the modifications of the field? in the thirteenth chapter? are Kshara or the perishable. Kshara is the changing one. It is the everchanging form of matter which is inert or insentient.\n\n#### The Imperishable (Akshara)\nAkshara is the changeless. It is the unmanifest condition, generally described as deep ignorance or sleep for there is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is only a potential state. It is the condition in which all forms of life with its accompanying limitations lie latent? just as the tree lies latent in the seed of the fruit.\n\n### The Nature of Maya Sakti\nMaya Sakti? the illusory power of the Lord? is the seed from which the perishable being takes its birth. It is the seat of all the latent impressions of desires? actions? etc.? of various perishable creatures. Maya Sakti is the Akshara Purusha.\n\n### The Two Categories of Beings in Samsara\nIn Samsara there are two categories arranged in two separate groups of beings? called Purushas? as they are the limiting adjuncts of the Purusha.\n\n#### The Limiting Adjuncts\nThe unmanifest condition is generally described as deep ignorance or sleep for there is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is only a potential state. In this state matter and energy are one. In this state sound? matter and energy exist in an undifferentiated state. In this state the Gunas exist in a state of equilibrium.\n\n#### The Kutastha\nThe imperishable is known as the Kutastha? i.e.? that which remains immovable like a heap. That which is at the root (Kuta) of all these beings is the Kutastha. Or? Kuta also means illusion? and Kutastha means that which manifests itself in diverse forms of illusion.\n\n### The Nature of Maya\nThat which conceals the Truth and shows the false thing and deceives the world? yminded people is Maya or Kuta. That which is of the form of the AvaranaVikshepa Sakti (veiling and vacillating power) is Kutastha. As this Maya Sakti cannot be destroyed except by the knowledge of the Self? it is said to be endless.\n\n### The Endlessness of Maya\nThat seed of Samsara has no end. Therefore? it is said to be imperishable in the sense that it is not destroyed in the absence of knowledge of the Self. But the seed is scorched or destroyed in toto when one gets the knowledge of Brahman.\n\n### The Purushottama\nPurushottama or the highest Purusha is distinct from these two -- the perishable and the imperishable. He is not affected by the evils of the two vehicles or limiting adjuncts of the perishable and the imperishable. He is eternal? pure? intelligent and free by nature.\n\n#### The Characteristics of Purushottama\nHe is eternal. He is pure. He is intelligent and free by nature."

Therefore He is called the Supreme Being by the Vedas and men of this world. He pervades the three worlds and upholds them yet? He is not tainted by the world. He is above the world or worldliness.\n\n### The Three Worlds\n\nThe three worlds are Bhuh (the earth), Bhuvah (the midregion), and Svah (heaven). Purushottama is further described as follows: He is the imperishable and omniscient Lord Narayana Who permeates the three worlds by His vital energy and sustains them by His mere existence in them.\n\n### The Nature of Purushottama\n\nJust as the waking state is different from the dream or the deep sleep states? just as the orb of the sun is different from his rays or the mirage they cause? so also is the highest Purusha different from the perishable and the imperishable Purushas.\n\n### The Imperishable Being (Akshara Brahman)\n\nWho is beyond the world and the Avyaktam (the Unmanifested) are essentially the same as the Purushottama. Who transcends both the Kshara and the Akshara.\n\n### The Distinction Between Purushottama and Other Beings\n\nThe Purushottama is ite distinct from the two -- Kshara and Akshara. He is the Supreme Being.\n\n### The Concept of Self\n\nThe physical body? the astral body and the causal body are also termed the Self. But these are secondary selves. Paramatma or the Supreme Self is the primary Self. Purushottama or Paramatma is the supreme or the highest when compared with the other secondary selves created by ignorance. He is the innermost consciousness of all beings. He is the support of everything. He is the Niyanta? the Inner Ruler. He is independent.\n\n### The Name \"Paramatma\"\n\nHe is known as the Supreme Self in the Vedanta. Anyah Another? ite distinct from the two.\n\n### The Lord Narayana\n\nPurushottama is further described as follows: He is the imperishable and omniscient Lord Narayana Who permeates the three worlds by His vital energy and sustains them by His mere existence in them.\n\n### The Avyaya\n\nAvyaya Imperishable? that which is free from the modifications such as birth? death? etc. Just as the king who rules his subjects and controls them is distinct from them? so also the Supreme Being Who is the ruler of the perishable and the imperishable is distinct from them.

    "explanation": "**Commentary on the Fifteenth Discourse of the Bhagavad Gita**\n\n### The Most Profound Secret\n\n**Buddhiman: A Knower of the Self**\nThe knowledge of the Self which gives emancipation from the round of birth and death? and freedom from the bonds of Karma is eulogised in this verse. If this most profound teaching is rightly understood? known or realised? it makes a man wise and gives him illumination.\n\n### The Goal of Life\n\nAfter this there is nothing left for him to know or strive for. He has reached the goal of life or the aim of human existence. He has arrived at the end of his journey. His endeavour for Selfrealisation is over. He has attained perfection. He has complete knowledge of the Supreme Being.\n\n### The State of Liberation\n\nHe gets Brahma Jnana. He moves in the consciousness of the Divine. He beholds the Self everywhere. He lives in Brahman. He regards all activities as His divine play.\n\n### The Realisation of Brahman\n\nWhen one realises Brahman? he has discharged all the duties of life. He is liberated from the bonds of Karma. He becomes a Jivanmukta or illumined sage who has transcended the bodyconsciousness? the three alities of Nature? the three states of consciousness (wakeful state? dream and deep sleep)? the pairs of opposites and the cycle of birth and death.\n\n### The Understanding of the Profound Mystery\n\nHe knows fully well that rirth has been destroyed? that what has to be done has been accomplished? that lifes highest goal has been reached and that he has nothing more to do or to learn. He has understood the profound mystery of life -- the riddle of this universe.\n\n### The State of All-Knowledge\n\nHe is a Sarvavit or allknower. The whole of the Gita is called science? yet the fifteenth discourse alone is here declared as the science for the sake of eulogising it. The fifteenth discourse contains the intessence of the Gita? the Upanishads and the Vedas.\n\n### The Significance of the Fifteenth Discourse\n\nThis is the butter churned from the milk of the Vedas. It has been said that? He who knows the peepul tree knows the Veda (XV.1). The Lord has also said? It is I Who am to be known by all the Vedas (XV.15).\n\n### The Condition of Wisdom\n\nOnly when a man knows this science as taught above does he become wise -- but not otherwise. Whatever duty a Brahmana of the highest birth has to do? all that has been doen when one attains the knowledge of the Self. All actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge (IV.33).\n\n### The Fulfillment of the Birth\n\nThis is the fulfilment of the birth? particularly of a Brahmana because the twicorn accomplishes all his duties only by attaining to this? but not otherwise? says Manu Smriti.\n\n### The Gift of the Supreme Being\n\nAs you have heard from Me this truth about the Supreme Being? you are a happy man and you have done all your duties you have attained Selfrealistion.\n\n### The Significance of the Words Anagha and Bharata\n\nLord Krishna hints that even when an ordinary man who knows this fifteenth discourse can attain knowledge of the Self and become a Kritakritya? then what to say of Arjuna who was sinless and who was born in a noble family with divine attributes The Lord? by using the word Anagha? also indicates that the Guru who is a knower of Brahman should instruct the most profound secret (the science of the Self) only to alified persons who are free from impurities of the heart or tossing of the mind? who are calm and endowed with the four means of salvation.\n\n### The Warning Against Impurities\n\nThe man of impure mind will not be able to grasp the truth. The sinful man with his perverted intellect will distort the truth and thus pave the way for the destruction of himself and his followers.\n\n### The Conclusion\n\nThus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the fifteenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Supreme Spirit."

    "explanation": "**16.1: The Three Kinds of Nature**\n=====================================\n\nThe Lord made a mention of the three kinds of nature that belong to sentient beings, viz., the nature of the gods, Asuras and Rakshasas. He now describes them in detail in this discourse.\n\n### The Nature of the Gods\n\nThe nature of the gods leads to Moksha or release from the round of birth and death. The divine nature must be accepted and cultivated, while the Asuric and Rakshasic nature should be abandoned. All these attributes are found in human beings.\n\n### The Nature of Asuras and Rakshasas\n\nThe nature of the Asuras and Rakshasas leads to bondage. This is an obstacle to the attainment of knowledge of the Self.\n\n### The Three Kinds of Nature in Human Beings\n\nThere are Sattvic people who possess the divine attributes, there are Asuras and Rakshasas among human beings also, who are endowed with demoniacal attributes.\n\n### The Three Gunas\n\nIn an ordinary man there is a mixture of the three Gunas: Tamas and Rajas pull a man downwards, while Sattva lifts a man upwards. Tamas and Rajas lead to bondage, while Sattva helps to attain salvation.\n\n### Developing Sattva\n\nDiscipline yourself and develop Sattva. This is the foundation of Yoga. This is the first preparatory discipline.\n\n### Characteristics of a Sattvic Man\n\nThe Sattvic man controls the senses, does selfless service, and practises Japa, Pranayama, concentration, meditation, selfanalysis, and inquiry of \"Who am I?\" He is not attracted by sensual objects. He has a burning desire for attaining Moksha.\n\n### The Nature of the Rajasic Man\n\nThe Rajasic man is proud, egoistic, selfsufficient, lustful, hottempered, greedy, and jealous. He works for his own glory and fame and selfaggrandisement.\n\n### The Nature of the Tamasic Man\n\nThe Tamasic man is attached to sensual pleasures, hatred predominates in his nature, and he does various sorts of harm and injury to others.\n\n### The Connection between the Gunas and Karmas\n\nThe nature of the Karmas depends upon the nature of the Gunas. A Sattvic man will do virtuous actions, while a Rajasic and Tamasic man will perform evil actions.\n\n### The Self or Brahman\n\nThe Self or Brahman is actionless. It is the silent witness.\n\n### The Three Kinds of Nature in Yoga\n\nThe Lord sums up in the first three verses the attributes of a godly man who is inclined to the path of liberation. He then enumerates the attributes of the demoniacal man.\n\n### Virtue and Vice\n\nVirtue and vice are relative terms. The virtue of one period will become the vice of the other.\n\n### Daivi Sampat\n\nDaivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine attributes) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self. The Sattvic or divine attributes such as fearlessness, purity of heart, and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga constitute Daivi Sampat.\n\n### The Three Preeminent Virtues\n\nFearlessness, purity of heart, and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga are the three preeminent virtues amongst the Sattvic attributes enumerated in verses 1 to 3. They are found in Jnana Yogins only.\n\n### The Importance of Sattvic Virtues\n\nUnless you possess Sattvic virtues, you cannot practise any kind of Yoga. If you cultivate one virtue, all other virtues will cling to you by themselves.\n\n### The Three Kinds of Yoga\n\nSvadhyaya and Tamas constitute Kriya Yoga. Svadhyaya constitutes BrahmaYajna. Almsgiving and sacrifice pertain to Karma Yoga.\n\n### Daivi Sampat for Different Paths\n\nAmong the divine attributes, fearlessness stands foremost. Fear is an effect of ignorance. Identification with the body causes fear.\n\n### The Importance of Sattvasamsuddhi\n\nPurity of understanding, cleanliness of life, or purity of heart constitute Sattvasamsuddhi.\n\n### The Importance of Jnana\n\nJnana (knowledge) understanding the nature of the Self, as taught in the scriptures and by the preceptor, is Jnana.\n\n### The Importance of Yoga\n\nYoga is union of the individual soul with the Supreme Being. It is the direct realisation of the Self by concentration and meditation.\n\n### The Three Kinds of Nature in Jnana Yogins\n\nThe state of Jivanmukti attained through Jnana Yoga, which is distinct from the state of the worldly-minded persons.\n\n### The Importance of Fearlessness\n\nFearlessness is essential for the attainment of Moksha or salvation. Fearlessness is the chief characteristic of a liberated sage.\n\n### The Importance of Sattvic Subha Vasana\n\nSattvic Subha Vasana (good tendency) is Daivi Sampat. It induces a man to practise discrimination, dispassion, control of the mind and the senses.\n\n### The Importance of Rajasic and Tamasic Vasanas\n\nThe Rajasic and the Tamasic (Asubha or evil) Vasnas, which operate along the currents of RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes), constitute demoniacal nature.\n\n### The Importance of Arjavam\n\nStraightforwardness is conducive to the attainment of knowledge. The aspirant should always be candid, upright or straightforward.\n\n### The Importance of Svadhyaya\n\nStudy of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.\n\n### The Importance of Tapas\n\nAusterity, moritification of the body and other forms of penance, is true Tapas. It is meditation on the Self.\n\n### The Importance of Daivi Sampat\n\nDaivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine attributes) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self.\n\n### The Importance of Dana\n\nAlmsgiving, distributing food, clothes, etc., as far as it lies in one's power, according to one's means.\n\n### The Importance of Dama\n\nSelf-restraint, self-control, control of the external senses.\n\n### The Importance of Yajna\n\nSacrifice. The fireworship (Agnihotra) and the like enjoined in the Vedas.\n\n### The Importance of Svadhyaya\n\nStudy of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.\n\n### The Importance of Tapas\n\nAusterity, moritification of the body and other forms of penance.\n\n### The Importance of Arjavam\n\nStraightforwardness is conducive to the attainment of knowledge."

This concept is further elaborated in the following verses.\n\n#### The Nature of Men\n\nThe men who are created with the two kinds of nature - the divine and the demonical - are here mentioned as the two creations. Every man in this world comes under the one or the other of the two creations.\n\n#### The Characteristics of Men with Devilish Qualities\n\nLord Krishna says to Arjuna:\n\n\"I will now describe to thee the characteristics of those men who are endowed with devilish qualities. If you have an understanding of the demoniacal qualities, you will avoid them.\"\n\nThe demoniacal nature is described in detail to the very end of this discourse.\n\n#### References to Demoniacal Nature\n\nThere is some reference in chapter IX, verses 9, 11, and 12, to the demoniacal nature. However, as the description is incomplete, it is completed in this discourse.\n\n#### The Divine Nature\n\nThe divine nature has been declared in detail by the blessed Lord in the previous chapters. The state of a Sthitaprajna is described in chapter II, the state of a Bhagavata in chapter XII, and the state of a Trigunatita in chapter XIV. The characteristics of men with divine qualities are also described in the first three verses of this discourse.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad provides a clear understanding of the two divisions of created beings, one divine and the other satanic. By understanding these characteristics, individuals can avoid the demoniacal qualities and cultivate their divine nature.\n\n### Key Points\n\n* The two divisions of created beings are the one divine and the other satanic.\n* Every man in this world comes under the one or the other of the two creations.\n* The demoniacal nature is described in detail to the very end of this discourse.\n* The divine nature has been declared in detail by the blessed Lord in the previous chapters.\n\n### Quotes\n\n* \"I will now describe to thee the characteristics of those men who are endowed with devilish qualities.\" - Lord Krishna\n* \"If you have an understanding of the demoniacal qualities, you will avoid them.\" - Lord Krishna"

They think that they are very great persons on account of the good qualities which they have superimposed upon themselves and their egoism is increased thereby.\n\n### The Effects of Egoism\n\nEgoism manifests itself in various ways:\n\n*   **Power**: The Asuras use their strength of body to humiliate and destroy others. If a man is not established in Yama (the fivefold canon of ethical perfection? consisting of noninjury? truthfulness? nonstealing? celibacy and noncovetousness)? if he has no purity of heart? if his mind is surcharged or saturated with evil tendencies? and if he gets power of any sort? he will misuse or abuse it and try to humiliate or abuse others.\n*   **Haughtiness**: A man whose heart is filled with haughtiness becomes very insolent and unjust and assumes an overbearing and domineering attitude towards others. He never respects the elders? Gurus and others.\n*   **Anger**: Anger manifests itself when one gets something unpleasant and when he comes across something disagreeable.\n\n### The Nature of Egoistic Asuras\n\nThese Asuras hate Me? the Lord Who dwells in their own bodies as the silent witness of their thoughts and actions. They think that I am also a human being and hate Me. They do not understand My all-pervading and imperishable nature. They do not care at all to know and follow My ways or the injunctions given in the Vedas and the Smritis.\n\n### Types of Egoism\n\nThere are several types of egoism:\n\n*   **Matsarya**: a form of jealousy. If a man superimposes evil qualities on a virtuous man who is endowed with good qualities? this is Asuya. If his heart burns when he sees a wealthy or prosperous man? this is Irshya.\n\n### Overcoming Egoism\n\nIt is very difficult to overcome this dire enemy? but through Vichara (right inquiry) it can be annihilated."

    "explanation": "**Commentary on 16.21**\n===============\n\n### The Three Fountainheads of Misery\n\nLust, anger, and greed are the three fountainheads of misery. These three constitute the gateway leading to the lowest of hells.\n\n#### The Enemies of Peace, Devotion, and Knowledge\n\nThese three evil modifications of the mind arise in the individual, causing man to lose his balance or poise and discrimination. As a result, he commits various evil actions.\n\n#### The Nature of Lust, Anger, and Greed\n\nLust, anger, and greed denote self-blindness and ignorance. There are no Vasanas (wants) or anger or greed in Brahman, the pure immortal Self.\n\n### The Gate to Hell\n\nThe gate to hell is the gateway leading to destruction. The self is destroyed by merely entering at this gate, i.e., it is not fit to do any right exertion to attain the goal of life.\n\n#### The Destructive Nature of the Gate\n\nAs this gate causes self-destruction, let everyone renounce these three evils.\n\n### The Fruits of Abandoning the Three Evils\n\nIn the next verse, the man who has abandoned these three evils is highly eulogised.\n\n**The Three Evils to Abandon**\n-------------------------\n\n*   **Lust**: The lustful mind is consumed by desire and attachment. It leads to a life of pleasure-seeking, but ultimately ends in suffering.\n*   **Anger**: Anger is the root of all evil. It clouds the mind, leading to impulsive decisions and actions that bring harm to oneself and others.\n*   **Greed**: Greed is the insatiable desire for more. It leads to attachment, which is the root of all suffering.\n\n**The Path to Liberation**\n-------------------------\n\nTo attain liberation from these three evils, one must cultivate the following qualities:\n\n*   **Self-awareness**: Recognize the true nature of the self and the world.\n*   **Discrimination**: Develop the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad.\n*   **Wisdom**: Cultivate wisdom by studying the scriptures and seeking guidance from spiritual teachers.\n\n**The Importance of Renouncing the Three Evils**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nRenouncing these three evils is essential for spiritual growth and self-realization. By abandoning lust, anger, and greed, one can:\n\n*   **Attain peace of mind**: Free from the disturbances caused by these three evils.\n*   **Realize one's true nature**: Unveil the true self, beyond the veil of ignorance.\n*   **Attain liberation**: Achieve moksha, or freedom from the cycle of birth and death."

The word \"विमुक्तः\" means \"liberated\" or \"free from\". This implies that the individual is free from the cycle of birth and death, known as samsara.\n\n### Addressing O Kaunteya\n\nThe verse then addresses O Kaunteya, a reference to Lord Krishna's son. This address is a way of acknowledging the listener and inviting them to engage with the teachings.\n\n### The Three Gates\n\nThe phrase \"तमोद्वारैः gates to darkness?\" refers to the three gates of darkness that lead to hell. These gates are full of pain and delusion.\n\n### The Three Aspects of Man\n\nThe next phrase, \"त्रिभिः (by) three?\", highlights the three aspects of man: the physical body, the mind, and the spirit. The word \"नरः\" means \"man\", emphasizing the importance of understanding these three aspects.\n\n### Practices and Spiritual Instructions\n\nThe verse then mentions that the individual practices spiritual instructions, which leads to liberation. The word \"आचरति\" means \"practices\", and the phrase \"आत्मनः for him?\" refers to the individual's self-realization.\n\n### The Concept of Goodness\n\nThe phrase \"श्रेयः what is good?\" raises an important question about the nature of goodness. This concept is central to understanding the teachings of the verse.\n\n### The Path to Salvation\n\nThe final phrase, \"ततः and then?\", sets the stage for understanding the path to salvation. The individual must abandon the gates to hell and follow the path of righteousness.\n\n### The Company of Sages\n\nThe verse mentions that the individual gets the company of sages, which leads to liberation. The word \"ज्ञानी\" means \"sage\", emphasizing the importance of seeking guidance from wise individuals.\n\n### Spiritual Instructions and Reflection\n\nThe phrase \"ज्ञानी\" also highlights the importance of spiritual instructions and reflection. The individual must listen to the scriptures, reflect on their teachings, meditate, and attain self-realization.\n\n### The Tamodvara Gate to Darkness\n\nThe final phrase, \"तमोद्वारैः gates to darkness?\", serves as a reminder of the Tamodvara gate, which leads to hell. This gate is full of pain and delusion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the verse 16.22 offers a profound commentary on the nature of liberation and the path to salvation. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the three aspects of man, practicing spiritual instructions, and seeking guidance from wise individuals."

    "explanation": "**The Threefold Faith**\n=========================\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe whole world is made up as if were of faith. Faith assumes a threefold aspect under the influence of the three alities.\n\n#### Development of Faith\n\nWhen Sattva is strongly developed, when there is a preponderance of Sattva or purity in a man, it is easy for him to attain Self-realization or the knowledge of the Self.\n\nIf Rajas is predominant, the faith becomes the handmaid of activity. If Tamas or inertia prevails, faith is annihilated.\n\n#### Types of Faith\n\nThose who are endowed with Sattvic faith aim at the attainment of liberation. Those who are endowed with Rajasic faith run after inferior duties or worldly activities.\n\nThose whose faith is Tamasic are cruel. They kill animals for sacrifice. They invoke the spirits and talk with ghosts.\n\n#### Influence of Faith on Salvation\n\nWhen faith is joined to Sattva, it leads to salvation. When Rajas preponderates, it colours the faith and leads to various activities. When Tamas predominates, the faith results in darkness.\n\n#### Interaction of Faith with Mind\n\nFaith acquires different alities when it is in company with the mind of man. Mind is a thing of many colours.\n\nJust as the water of the Ganga is contaminated by being put in a vessel where lior had been kept, so also a virtuous person is spoiled by bad company or constant association with evil persons.\n\n#### Colouring of Faith\n\nThe three Gunas or attributes colour the faith of a man. The mind of a man is governed by the preponderating attribute or ality which manifests itself when the other two alities are suppressed.\n\nFaith takes a threefold aspect in accordance with the inherent nature or tendencies of the man. The inclinations of men are moulded according to their ality or inherent nature born of their past Samskaras.\n\n#### Cycle of Birth and Death\n\nAs is the tendency, so is the desire as is the desire, so is the action as is the action? so is the birth into another being after death.\n\nThe body is like the seed of the tree; a perpetual chain. Seed perishes in developing into a tree and the tree again produces the seed.\n\nThis process or cycle continues eternally. Even so man takes a body, does actions, develops tendencies, dies and puts on a new body in accordance with the nature or tendencies.\n\nThis continues till he gets knowledge of the Self by transcending the three Gunas when ignorance, the root cause of birth and death, is destroyed.\n\n#### Origin of Faith\n\nFaith is born of the individual nature? i.e.? the Samskaras or the latent impressions of virtuous and vicious actions which were performed in the past births and which manifested themselves at the time of death.\n\nIn the subconscious mind or the Chitta there is a reservoir of past impressions which are revived through the operation of memory.\n\n#### Types of Faith in Worship\n\nSattvic Faith in the worship of gods? which is an effect of Sattva.\n\nRajasic Faith in the worship of the Yakshas and Rakshasas? which is an effect of Rajas.\n\nTamasic Faith in the worship of the disembodied spirits and ghosts? which is an effect of Tamas.\n\n#### Importance of Faith\n\nFaith is the main support of life. It is not mere intellectual belief or blind acceptance of pet dogmas or doctrines.\n\nYou must understand clearly its characteristics? just as you recognize a tree from the fruits, the mind of a man from his speech, and the actions of previous birth from worldly pleasures and pains.\n\n### Svabhavaja\n\nInherent in their nature born of past Samskaras.

The nature of this faith determines the object of worship.\n\n#### Types of Faith\n\nThere are three types of faith: Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic. Each type has a distinct characteristic effect.\n\n*   **Sattvic Faith**: The Sattvic faith is associated with the worship of gods and other divine beings. A person with a predominantly Sattvic nature will express their faith in a Sattvic manner.\n*   **Rajasic Faith**: The Rajasic faith is associated with passion and desire. A person with a predominantly Rajasic nature will express their faith in a Rajasic manner.\n*   **Tamasic Faith**: The Tamasic faith is associated with darkness and ignorance. A person with a predominantly Tamasic nature will express their faith in a Tamasic manner.\n\n### Selecting the Object of Worship\n\nEach person selects their object of worship according to the ruling Guna (quality) of their being. The expression of a person's faith depends on the predominant Guna.\n\n### Characteristics of Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic Faith\n\n*   **Sattvic**: Rare in this world. Associated with the worship of gods and other divine beings.\n*   **Rajasic**: Associated with passion and desire. Characterized by intense emotions and desires.\n*   **Tamasic**: Associated with darkness and ignorance. Characterized by a lack of understanding and awareness.\n\n### Objects of Worship\n\nThe objects of worship vary depending on the type of faith. Some examples include:\n\n*   **Yakshas**: The brothers of Kubera, the lord of wealth. They are spirits that guard wealth.\n*   **Rakshasas**: Beings of strength and power, such as Nairrita demons or giants gifted with illusive powers.\n*   **Bhutas**: Ghosts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe nature of faith determines the object of worship. Each type of faith has a distinct characteristic effect, and each person selects their object of worship according to the ruling Guna of their being."

This is also considered bodily austerity.\n\n**What Constitutes Physical Austerity?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*   Using the feet in pilgrimage to sacred temples\n*   Using the hands in cleaning temples and collecting materials for worship\n*   Performing prostrations to Brahmanas, preceptors, and the wise\n\n### The Role of Physical Austerity in Spiritual Growth\n\nThe physical body is the chief agent in doing such austerity. The practice of nonstealing and noncovetousness are also included in physical austerity.\n\n**The Importance of Self-Control**\n\nA wise man is one who has realised I am Brahman. This understanding is not limited to Sudras, as seen in the example of Vidura.\n\n### Brahmacharya: Control, Not Suppression\n\nBrahmacharya means control, but not suppression of the sex desire or sex force. It involves:\n\n*   Filling the mind with sublime thoughts through meditation, Japa, prayer, and study of holy scriptures\n*   Contemplation of the sexless, pure Self\n\n### The Effects of Suppressed Sex Desire\n\nSuppressed sex desire will attack you again and again, producing wet dreams, irritability, and restlessness of the mind.\n\n### The Importance of Mind Control\n\nThe mind should be rendered pure by meditation, Japa, singing of the Lord's names, and prayer. The mind should be controlled first, making it easier to control the senses.\n\n### The Order of Control\n\nThe practice of Sama (control of the mind) comes first, followed by Dama (restraint of the senses), in the order of the sixfold virtues.\n\n### The Relationship Between Mind and Senses\n\nThe senses cannot operate without the help of the mind. Therefore, controlling the mind first is essential for effective control over the senses.\n\n### The Dangers of Intense Musing on Sensory Objects\n\nIntense musing on the objects of the senses does more harm to the inner spiritual life than actual sense gratification.\n\n### The Need for Sadhana\n\nMere mortification of the external senses will not produce the desired effect. The mind must be rendered pure by Sadhana.\n\n### The Difficulty of Controlling the Mind\n\nControlling the mind is difficult for neophytes or beginners. It will be extremely difficult to control the mind first when the senses are allowed to run riot.\n\n### The Correct Approach\n\nThe theory or doctrine that the mind should be controlled first is correct.

Control of the one goes hand in hand with control of the other.\n\n### The Two-Fronted Attack\n\nControl the mind first, or control the senses first. This is simply arguing in a vicious circle.\n\n### The Paradox of Control\n\nYou will get the knowledge of the Self if you control all desires. You can control all the desires only if you have knowledge of the Self.\n\n### The Practical Approach\n\nTry to do either practice according to your liking, capacity, taste, and temperament. You can find out by actual practice which is better.\n\n### The Gradual Disappearance of Doubt\n\nAs you advance in your practice, your doubt will gradually disappear, and you will enjoy supreme peace and joy."

However, the donor should not boast of his charity.\n\n### Key Points to Consider\n\n*   The gift should be given to one who cannot return the good or to one from whom no such return is expected.\n*   The time and place of the gift should be in a truly sacred location, such as Kurukshetra or Varanasi.\n*   The recipient should be a pious individual, well-versed in the scriptures, and able to protect himself and the donor.\n*   The gift should be given freely, without boasting of one's charity."

The verse 17.21 of the Mahabharata explores the nature of charity and gift-giving, highlighting their potential rewards and consequences.\n\n#### Key Questions Answered by Verse 17.21\n\n*   **यत्** (that) - What is the nature of charity and gift-giving?\n*   **तु** (indeed) - Is it with a view to receive in return?\n*   **प्रत्युपकारार्थम्** (with a view to receive in return) - Is the intention behind charity and gift-giving solely to receive something in return?\n*   **फलम्** (fruit) - What is the outcome or result of charity and gift-giving?\n*   **उद्दिश्य** (looking for) - Is the purpose of charity and gift-giving to find something or achieve a goal?\n*   **वा** (or) - Is it possible to distinguish between charity and gift-giving?\n*   **पुनः** (again) - Is it possible to give charity and gift-giving again?\n*   **दीयते** (is given) - Is charity and gift-giving an act that is given or offered?\n*   **च** (and) - Is charity and gift-giving an act that is given or offered, accompanied by other factors?\n*   **परिक्लिष्टम्** (reluctantly) - Is charity and gift-giving an act that is given or offered, despite reluctance?\n*   **तत्** (that) - What is the nature of charity and gift-giving?\n*   **दानम्** (gift) - What is the nature of charity and gift-giving?\n*   **राजसम्** (Rajasic) - Is charity and gift-giving a Rajasic act?\n*   **स्मृतम्** (is held to be) - Is charity and gift-giving an act that is held to be worthy or virtuous?\n\n### Commentary on Charity and Gift-Giving\n\nCharity and gift-giving are viewed as acts that can bring about various consequences.

Understanding the nature of these acts is crucial for making informed decisions and cultivating a virtuous lifestyle.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   Charity and gift-giving can have various consequences, including the possibility of receiving something in return or achieving a goal.\n*   The nature of charity and gift-giving can be influenced by factors such as intention, motivation, and emotional state.\n*   Charity and gift-giving can be viewed as acts that are given or offered, accompanied by other factors.\n*   Charity and gift-giving can be considered Rajasic acts if they are motivated by a desire for reward or pleasure.\n*   Charity and gift-giving can be considered virtuous acts if they are motivated by a desire to benefit others or achieve spiritual growth."

The fault of defect of Karma is certainly not in the action itself, but in the expectation of reward and attachment.\n\n**Key Points**\n-------------\n\n*   The fault lies not in the action, but in the expectation of reward and attachment.\n*   Even acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity are not inherently bad.\n*   Actions performed without attachment and the idea of agency do not hinder emancipation.\n*   Expectation of rewards destroys Rajas and Tamas, filling the mind with Sattva or purity.\n*   Selfless actions, performed without attachment, destroy Karma bonds.\n\n**The Nature of Karma**\n----------------------\n\nKarma is the law of cause and effect. It binds us to our actions, and their consequences.\n\n**The Role of Attachment**\n-------------------------\n\nAttachment is the root cause of Karma's binding power. When we perform actions with attachment, we create a cycle of cause and effect that binds us to our desires.\n\n**The Power of Selflessness**\n---------------------------\n\nSelfless actions, performed without attachment and the idea of agency, are instrumental in destroying Karma bonds.\n\n**The Lord's Teachings**\n---------------------\n\nThe Lord said, \"Hear from Me the conclusion or the final truth about renunciation.\" He emphasized that acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be given up as they are purifiers of the wise.\n\n**The Importance of Discrimination**\n-----------------------------------\n\nDiscrimination is essential in performing actions without attachment. It allows us to separate our ego from the action, freeing us from Karma's binding power.\n\n**The Abandonment of Desire**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe abandonment of desire is the key to breaking free from Karma's cycle. Just as scorched seeds can render barren trees, our desire for rewards can burn away the fruit-bearing tendency of Karma.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe Lord's teachings conclude that acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should be performed without attachment.

The question seeks to understand which is the correct path.\n\n### Breaking Down the Question\n\n*   **दुःखम् (it is) painful?** - The verse inquires if experiencing pain or suffering is indeed a difficult experience.\n*   **इति thus?** - The question then asks if this is the correct path to follow.\n*   **एव even?** - The verse also asks if this path is the correct one to take.\n*   **यत् which?** - The question seeks to understand the nature of this path.\n*   **कर्म action?** - The verse inquires if the path is related to actions (कर्म).\n*   **कायक्लेशभयात् from fear of bodily trouble?** - The question asks if the path is motivated by a fear of physical suffering.\n*   **त्यजेत् abandons?** - The verse asks if one should abandon this path.\n*   **सः he?** - The question seeks to understand if one should follow this path.\n*   **कृत्वा performing?** - The verse inquires if one should perform this path.\n*   **राजसम् Rajasic?** - The question asks if the path is related to the Rajasic nature.\n*   **त्यागम् abandonment?** - The verse asks if the path is one of abandonment.\n*   **न not?** - The question seeks to understand if this path is the correct one.\n*   **एव even?** - The verse asks if this path is indeed the correct one.\n*   **त्यागफलम् the fruit of abandonment?** - The question seeks to understand the reward or outcome of this path.\n*   **लभेत् obtains** - The verse asks if one can obtain the reward of this path.\n\n### Understanding the Answer\n\nThe Lord says that the reward of renunciation (त्यागम्) is Moksha or emancipation. This path is accompanied by wisdom and determination.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   **Determination and persistence are required** for the performance of religious duties and actions.\n*   **One may begin an action but may relinquish it** before completion due to difficulties or physical suffering.\n*   **Sattvic renunciation is the correct path** that involves abandoning all actions accompanied with wisdom.\n*   **The reward of renunciation is Moksha or emancipation**."

    "explanation": "**Commentary on the Nature of Karma and Action**\n\n### The Threefold Nature of Karma\n\nOne fruit (of action) is pleasant? another is unpleasant? while the third is a mixture of both. Those in whom good actions preponderate are reborn as gods. Men of evil lives are reborn into animal or vegetable kingdoms. If their actions are truly good and bad? they are reborn into the human kingdom.\n\n### The Illusion of Karma\n\nThese distinctions of good? evil and mixed do not exist for the liberated sage who has gone beyond the bonds of Karma by destroying egoism? by annihilating the idea of agency and by abandoning the hope of rewards of actions.\n\n### The Action of a Renouncer\n\nThe action of a renouncer does not generate desire or attachment thereto. Therefore? after death he is not born again.\n\n### The Bondage of Karma\n\nThe actions that are performed without any desire for the reward can bring no bondage to the man at any time.\n\n### The Liberation from Karma\n\nHe who has surrendered the fruits of all his works to the Lord is free from the bondage of Karma. Some kind of action is inevitable and natural to all beings? but the man of renunciation abandons the fruits of actions.\n\n### The Nature of Karma\n\n**Fruit (Phala)**\n\nThis is caused by the operation of various external factors. This is brought forth by Avidya (ignorance). It is like jugglery and very delusive. The term Phala denotes something that quickly passes away? something not real? not solid.\n\n### Virtue and Vice\n\n**Karma Action**\n\nVirtue and vice are the two sides of Karma. Disagreeable or evil? such as hell? the animal kingdom? etc.\n\n**Wished or Agreeable**\n\nWished or agreeable or good. Ishtam\n\n### The Mixed Nature of Karma\n\nGood and evil mixed together the human birth.\n\n### The Unenlightened and the Enlightened\n\nOnly the unenlightened who have not renounced the fruits of actions reap these three sorts of fruits. The real Sannyasins who belong to the highest order of Sannyasa (Paramahamsa Parivrajakas) who are ever engaged in meditation on the pure? immortal Self? who are solely devoted to Selfknowledge? and who rest in their own essential nature as ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute do not reap any fruits as the fire of Selfknowledge has burnt ignorance and its effects which are the seeds of Samsara.\n\n### The Liberated Sage\n\nOnly a liberated sage who has attained knowledge of the Self and who has no identification with the body can totally relish all actions. He knows that the Self is beyond all actions and that action is attributed to the Self by ignorance.\n\n### The Ignorant Man\n\nThe ignorant man who identifies himself with the body cannot abandon actions. He thinks that he is the agent or the doer of all actions and expects to attain the fruits of his actions and so he is born again and again in this world to reap the fruits of these actions."

    "explanation": "**Commentary on Chapter 18 of the Upanishads**\n\n### The Nature of the Self\n\nThe Self has no connection whatsoever with activity. Nature does everything. The Self is the silent witness. He remains indifferent.\n\n### The Five Causes\n\nThe whole superstructure of human activity is the result of the five well-defined causes which are enumerated in the following verse.\n\n#### Etani These\n\nEtani these, meaning \"these five,\" refer to the causes that lead to human activity. These causes are:\n\n*   **Pancha** (five): The five causes that lead to human activity.\n*   **Mahabaho**: O mighty-armed, referring to the powerful nature of these causes.\n*   **Kारणan**: Causes, explaining why these causes lead to human activity.\n*   **Nibodh**: Learn, teaching us how to understand these causes.\n*   **Me**: From Me, indicating that the Self is the source of these causes.\n\n#### Sankhya Vedanta\n\nThe knowledge of the Self as taught in the Vedanta (the Upanishads) puts an end to all actions. This is the reason why the term **Kritante** (the end of actions) is used here.\n\n### The End of Actions\n\nWhen the knowledge of the Self arises, all actions terminate. This is taught in chapter II, verse 46.\n\n#### The Brahman's Knowledge\n\nTo the Brahman who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of so much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood everywhere.\n\n#### The End of Actions (Again)\n\nIn verse 33 of chapter IV, it is said: \"All actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge.\" Vedanta therefore, which imparts knowledge of the Self, is the end of action.\n\n### The Liberated Sage\n\nA liberated sage who has attained the knowledge of the Self in accordance with the instructions laid down in the Vedanta becomes a **Kritakritya** (one who has done everything and has nothing more to do)."

Why do you then make a distinction in actions by saying whatever action a man does by the body? speech and mind\n-------------------------\n\nOur answer is In the performance of every action? one of the three -- body? speech or mind -- has a more prominent share than the others while seeing? hearing and other activities which accompany or go along with life are subordinate to that one.\n-------------------------\n\nTherefore all actions are classified under three groups and are spoken of as done by the body or speech or mind.\n-------------------------\n\nThe fruit of an actions also is enjoyed through the body? speech and mind and one of the three takes a more prominent share than the rest.\n-------------------------\n\nTherefore? it is proper to say Whatever action a man performs with his body? speech and mind\n-------------------------\n\n### Explanation\n\nIn this verse, the concept of \"three\" is discussed in relation to actions. The three entities involved are:\n\n*   **Body**: The physical body, which is a necessary factor in every action.\n*   **Speech**: The means of expression, which can be verbal or non-verbal.\n*   **Mind**: The mental faculties, which enable us to think and make decisions.\n\nThe verse states that one of these three entities has a more prominent share in every action, while the other two are subordinate. This distinction is important because it helps us understand the nature of actions and their consequences.\n\nThe verse also mentions that even those actions which may seem insignificant, such as winking or other necessary conditions of life, are still subject to the principles of Dharma and Adharma. This means that every action has a consequence, whether good or bad.\n\nThe verse concludes by stating that the fruit of an action is enjoyed through the body, speech, and mind. This means that our experiences and outcomes are influenced by all three of these entities.\n\nOverall, this verse provides a nuanced understanding of the concept of \"three\" in relation to actions and their consequences. It highlights the importance of considering the role of body, speech, and mind in every action, and how these entities interact to produce outcomes."

He is always the silent witness. He is the spectator of activity.\n\n### The Egoistic Man\n\nThe egoistic man of little understanding only thinks that he is the real agent. And so, he is bound by actions. He takes birth again and again to reap the fruits of his actions.\n\n**Characteristics of a Perverted Intelligence**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*   He considers the body as consciousness.\n*   He identifies himself with the body.\n*   He regards the Self as the actor or the agent.\n\n### The Deluded Life\n\nHe who identifies himself with the body, who has taken the body as the pure Self, has cast a net over himself. He leads a deluded life of utter ignorance.\n\n**Bound by Karma**\n-------------------\n\nHe is bound by the fetters or bonds of Karma. He is ever shut up in the prisonhouse of this body.\n\n### The Untrained Understanding\n---------------------------------\n\nHe who has not united himself with the Buddhi, who has got an impure or untrained understanding, who regards the Self as the actor or the agent is certainly a man of perverted intelligence.\n\n**The Blind Man**\n-----------------\n\nHe is deluded. He is really a blind man. He sees not though he has eyes. He does not behold the essence of things.\n\n**The Supreme Principle**\n-------------------------\n\nWhich is Itself actionless? Which ever stands as a silent witness of the activities of all minds and all organs of all beings?\n\n### The Magnet Analogy\n-------------------------\n\nJust as the magnet makes the iron pieces move.\n\n**The Truth about the Self and Action**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHe does not behold the truth about the Self and action.\n\n### The Evilminded Person\n-----------------------------\n\nA man of perverted intellect or undeveloped reason. He thinks that he alone is the doer or agent.\n\n**The Reason for this Delusion**\n---------------------------------\n\n*   He is not endowed with a pure and subtle intellect.\n*   His understanding (Buddhi) has not been trained in the practice of Vedanta.\n*   He is not equipped with the four means of salvation.\n*   His intellect has not been trained by the teachings of the preceptor or the spiritual teacher in the methods of logical reasoning.\n\n### The Man of Untrained Understanding\n--------------------------------------\n\nHe who considers that the pure actionless Self is the agent or the doer is certainly a man of untrained understanding.\n\n**The Consequences of this Delusion**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   He has no knowledge of the actionless Self and action.\n*   His intellect works or moves in the wrong direction.\n*   His intellect moves in the sensual grooves or avenues.\n\n### The Technique of Buddhi Yoga\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe technique of Buddhi Yoga taught in the Gita enables one effectively to prevent this.\n\n**The Untrained Understanding Sees Only**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThough he sees, he sees the external, gross, illusory, ever-changing, perishable objects only.\n\n**The Immortal Essence**\n-------------------------\n\nHe does not behold the one immortal, unchanging, all-blessful essence which is the basis or substratum of everything.\n\n**The Analogy of Jaundiced Eyes**\n---------------------------------\n\nHe is like the man with jaundiced eyes who sees all objects tinged with yellow color.\n\n**The Analogy of Diplopia**\n-----------------------------\n\nOr like the man suffering from diplopia who beholds many moons.\n\n**The Analogy of the Train**\n-----------------------------\n\nOr like the man who thinks that the moon moves when the clouds move.\n\n**The Analogy of the Train (Continued)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOr like the man who, seated in a train, imagines that the trees are moving when it is the train that is really moving."

    "explanation": "**Commentary I will explain to thee? O Arjuna? the characterisitics of the man who has transcended activity? and who has gone beyond the bonds of Karma.**\n\nWhen selfishness and egoism are destroyed, when desire and personal gain are renounced? actions cannot bind a man. He knows that the Self is not destroyed when the body perishes.\n\n**He has no idea of agency. The act of killing itself? in his case? becomes one necessary for the peace and harmony of the world.**\n\nHis killing without desire is like the killing of a murderer by the executioner and the judge on behalf of the community for the preservation of peace and harmony in the world.\n\n**He who has a trained intellect? pure understanding and developed reason? who has a knowledge of the scriptures? who has devoted himself to the study of the scriptures? who is eipped with the knowledge of logic?**\n\nwho is well trained by the instructions of his preceptor? is absolutely free from the egoistic notion that I am the agent or the doer. He knows perfectly well that Nature or Guna or ones own nature does everything.\n\n**He thus thinks I am the silent witness of all activities. I am not the doer. These five (the body? the actor? etc.) which are superimposed on the pure? actionless Self through ignorance are the causes of all actions.**\n\nI do not do anything. The senses move amongst the senseobjects. The alities (Gunas) move in their counterparts in the senses which are also the products of the Gunas.\n\n**I know the essence of the divisions of the alities and their functions. I am in essence without limbs. How can action or work be ascribed to me?**\n\nI am without hands? without legs? without feet? without breath and without mind. I am ever pure? spotless and immovable and immutable.\n\n**He will never repent thus I have done a wrong action. I ought to have done like this. I have done an evil action. I will go to hell.**\n\nHe is always wise. He can,never do a wrong action. His will has become one with the cosmic will. His will has become blended with the will of the Lord.\n\n**Whatever he does is done by the Lord only. He has no will of his own. He sees rightly. Though he kills? he does not commit the act of killing.**\n\nHe is beyond good and evil? beyond the pairs of opposites? as he has knowledge of the Self.\n\n**An objector says The statement that though he kills these people? he does not kill? is selfcontradictory.**\n\nWe say This objection is really not tenable. From the worldly point of view the Lord says though he kills? because man identifies the Self with the body? etc.? and thinks I am the killer.\n\n**From the transcendental point of view explained above? the Lord says? He kills not? he is not bound.**\n\nAnother objector says The Self acts in conjunction with the body? etc.? -- He who looks upon his Self Which is isolated? as the agent.\n\n**We say This objection also cannot stand. As the omnipresent ether is not affected by reason of its subtlety? even so the Self? seated everywhere in the body? is not affected.**\n\nThis immortal? immutable? changeless? formless? attributeless Self? though seated in the body? does not act and is not affected?\n\n**just as the crystal is not affected by the red colour of the flower that comes into contact with it? just as the sun is not affected by the diseases of the eye.**\n\nA thing that changes only can join with others and become the agent. The Self is always isolated? independent and free.\n\n**This Self is immutable (II.25). The alities move amidst the alities (III.28). Though seated in the body? He does not act (XIII.31).**\n\nActions are wrought by the alities (III.27). You will find in the Brihadaranyaka were.\n\n**By reasoning also we may establish the same conclusion thus**\n\nThe Self is indivisible? allpervading? infinite? limbless? without parts? independent? ever free and immutable.\n\n**Therefore the actions of the body can never be ascribed to the agency of the Self.**\n\nVerily the actions of one cannot go to another who has not done them.\n\n**Just as blue colour cannot belong to the sky? silver to the motherofpearl? water to mirage? so also what is ascribed to the Self by ignorance cannot really belong to It.**\n\nThe changes that occur in the body pertain to the body but not to the pure actionless Self which is always the spectator or the silent witness.\n\n**Therefore? it is right to say that the wise man who is free from egoism and all impurities of the mind? neither kills nor is he bound though he kills.**\n\n**Chapter II.19 and II.20**\n\nThe Lord stated the proposition -- He slayeth not? nor is he slain.\n\n**In chapter II.20? He said The Self is unborn? eternal? ancient the Self is not slain when the body is killed.**\n\nThe Lord has touched here and there that the Self is not affected by works? that there is no necessity for the wise man of doing actions.\n\n**He concludes that the sage kills not? nor is he bound? and sums up the teaching of the Gita.**\n\n**The teaching of the Gita has been concluded in this verse.**\n\n**The Sannyasins who are free from egoism are not affected by Karma.**\n\nThe threefold fruits of action? viz.? evil? good and mixed (see verse 12 above) do not accrue to them.\n\n**Those worldlyminded persons who work with egoism and expectation of fruits are tainted by the works.**\n\nThey are forced to experience the fruits of their actions and to take birth again and again.\n\n**Cf.II.19V.7**\n\n**The commentary concludes that the wise man is not bound by Karma and does not experience the fruits of his actions.**"

This is known as the Triputi or the traid. It is the conjunction of these three that impels a man to threefold action? viz.? mental? verbal and physical.\n\n### The Threefold Impulse\n\nThis triad is the driving force of all the activities of man. He rejoices at the sight of palatable sweetmeats and delicious fruits but is terrified at the sight of a cobra or tiger. The sight of pleasant or unpleasant objects affects him and he attempts either to possess the agreeable objects or to avoid the disagreeable ones.\n\n### The Antahkarana (the Inner Instrument)\n\nThe Antahkarana consists of the mind? intellect? subconscious mind and egoism. The ear? the skin? the tongue? the nose and the eye are the five organs of knowledge.\n\n### The Five Organs of Knowledge\n\nThe individual soul? propelled by these five senses? is led into activity. He does actions with the help of the five organs of action? viz.? speech? hands? feet? genitals and anus.\n\n### Types of Knowledge\n\nJnanam Any knowledge knowledge in general knowledge of worldly objects? etc.\nJneyam The object to be known objects in general.\n\n### The Knower\n\nParijnata The knower? the experiencer or the enjoyer? putting on the nature of the limiting adjuncts? a creature of ignorance.\n\nThis triad forms the threefold impulse to all action? to action in general. The performance of an action in order to get a thing or to avoid an object is possible only when there is the conjunction of the three? viz.? knowledge? knowable and knower.\n\n### The Organ\n\nKaranam The organ That by which something is done. The actions done by the five causes of action? viz.? the body? etc.? which are grouped under the three classes according to their respective seats? viz.? mind? speech and body? are all due to the interplay of the organ.\n\n### The Agent\n\nKarta The agent or the doer he who sets the organs in motion or action and puts on the nature of the limiting adjunct or vehicle in which he acts. All actions inhere in these three (the organ? the doer and the action itself) and they are? therefore? said to form the basis or the threefold constituents of action.\n\n### The Threefold Constituents\n\nAs action? the various factors of action and the fruits are all made up of the Gunas? the Lord describes them in the following verses.\n\n### The Gunas\n\nThe Gunas are the three qualities that make up all actions and their fruits. They are:\n\n* Sattva (purity, goodness)\n* Rajas (activity, passion)\n* Tamas (darkness, ignorance)\n\nThese Gunas are the basis of all actions and their consequences."

    "explanation": "**The Three Alities: A Study of Gunas and their Impact on Creation**\n\n### Overview of the Concept\n\nThe three alities, which include knowledge, action, and actor, are said to overpower the whole of creation with their special nature and bring it entirely under their control. According to the Sankhya philosophy, these three concepts are threefold according to the Gunas that is predominant.\n\n### The Three Alities\n\n*   **Knowledge**: ज्ञानम् (jñānam) - The nature of knowledge is a fundamental aspect of the universe. It is said to be threefold according to the Gunas that is predominant.\n*   **Action**: कर्म (karma) - The nature of action is another crucial aspect of the universe. It is said to be threefold according to the Gunas that is predominant.\n*   **Actor**: कर्ता (karta) - The nature of the actor is also threefold according to the Gunas that is predominant.\n\n### The Three Kinds of Gunas\n\nThe Sankhya system of philosophy refers to the science of Gunas, which is a complex and multifaceted concept. The three kinds of Gunas are:\n\n1.  **Sattvic**: सत्विक (sattvika) - The Sattvic Gunas are said to be pure, peaceful, and harmonious.\n2.  **Rajasic**: राजसिक (rajasika) - The Rajasic Gunas are said to be active, dynamic, and energetic.\n3.  **Tamasic**: तामसिक (tamasika) - The Tamasic Gunas are said to be dull, inactive, and lethargic.\n\n### The Impact of the Three Alities\n\nIf all three alities are Sattvic, then the action will not bind the man. This means that if an individual's knowledge, action, and actor are all aligned with the Sattvic Gunas, they will be free from the constraints of karma.\n\n### Commentary\n\nThe science of Gunas is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been studied by philosophers for centuries. While the Sankhya system of philosophy is opposed to Vedanta with reference to the Supreme Truth, viz., the oneness or nonduality of Brahman, it is an authority on the science of Gunas.\n\n### A Scientific and Rational Explanation\n\nIn this commentary, I shall describe knowledge, action, and actor as also their various distinctions caused by different Gunas scientifically and rationally. I shall hear My teachings, O Arjuna, with rapt attention, and you will be immensely benefited.\n\n### Hear My Teachings\n\nO Arjuna, I shall hear My teachings with rapt attention. You will be immensely benefited.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the three alities of knowledge, action, and actor are said to overpower the whole of creation with their special nature and bring it entirely under their control. According to the Sankhya philosophy, these three concepts are threefold according to the Gunas that is predominant. By understanding the science of Gunas, we can gain a deeper insight into the nature of reality and our place within it."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Reality: A Discussion on the Ultimate Truth**\n\n### The Concept of Sarvabhuteshu\n\nIn all beings, there exists a fundamental reality that transcends the diversity of objects. This reality is described as the \"one\" or the ultimate essence that underlies all existence.\n\n#### The Nature of Reality\n\nThe reality in question is described as indestructible, inexhaustible, and unchangeable. It is the substance or essence that cannot be exhausted either in itself or in its properties.\n\n**The Ether as a Metaphor**\n\nJust as the ether is indivisible, so also is the Self. The Self is the same in all bodies and is the common consciousness that pervades all beings.\n\n#### The Unity of Diversity\n\nThe seer beholds unity in diversity, one in many, and all in one. This perception is described as Sattvic or pure.\n\n**The Direct Perception of the Self**\n\nKnow thou, O Arjuna, this direct and right perception of the nondual Self. This understanding is the key to realizing the ultimate truth.\n\n### The Commentary on Bhavam\n\nThe One Self is the reality that underlies all existence. It is the common consciousness in all beings and is not different in different bodies.\n\n#### The Indivisible Essence\n\nThe Self is one homogeneous, indivisible essence or substance in all beings. This understanding is the foundation of spiritual growth and self-realization.\n\n### The Importance of Direct Perception\n\nThe direct perception of the nondual Self is essential for realizing the ultimate truth. This understanding is described as Sattvic or pure.\n\n**The Relationship to Other Texts**\n\nThis discussion is related to other texts in the Upanishads, such as IV.35, VI.29, XIII.16, and XVIII.30.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe ultimate truth is the reality that underlies all existence. It is the One Self, which is indestructible, inexhaustible, and unchangeable. This understanding is the key to realizing the nondual nature of reality.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* The ultimate truth is the One Self, which underlies all existence.\n* This reality is indestructible, inexhaustible, and unchangeable.\n* The Self is one homogeneous, indivisible essence or substance in all beings.\n* Direct perception of the nondual Self is essential for realizing the ultimate truth.\n\n**Quotes**\n\n* \"The One Self is the reality that underlies all existence.\" (Commentary on Bhavam)\n* \"Know thou, O Arjuna, this direct and right perception of the nondual Self.\" (Commentary on Bhavam)\n* \"The seer beholds unity in diversity, one in many, and all in one.\" (Commentary on Bhavam)\n\n**References**\n\n* IV.35\n* VI.29\n* XIII.16\n* XVIII.30"

Enveloping as it does the manifold creation with the veil of separateness? it deludes even the wise man.\n\nOwing to passionate knowledge? beings appear to be separate and the perception of unity is also lost sight of.\n\nThat knowledge which beholds multiplicity in created objects and differentiates them as being small or great? according to their form and size?\n\nis of passionate nature and tainted.\n\nA man with passionate knowledge sees diversity everywhere. He beholds the many only.\n\nNow I will explain to thee? O Arjuna?\n\nknowledge that is of the ality of darkness? in order that thou mayest avoid it."

This act is not done out of love for the Lord or hatred for something else, but rather it is a duty that has to be performed.\n\nThe performer of such pure action experiences great joy. He does his duty or any other work wholeheartedly, not caring for the reward but offering it willingly at the feet of the Lord.

    "explanation": "**The Characteristics of Action**\n\n### The Nature of the Passionate Man\n\nA passionate man performs various selfish actions. He boasts of his actions in public. Passion prompts him to do them. He can never work without expectation of a reward.\n\n### The Fruits of Action for the Passionate Man\n\nThe Rajasic or passionate man expects pleasures as fruits of action. A liberated sage alone is absolutely free from egoism. He will not dream even of a reward for the action, because all his desires are gratified when he realises Brahman. He is an Aptakama.\n\n### The Possibility of Longing in a Sage\n\nHow can there be longing or craving in a sage in whom all desires are gratified or burnt by the fire of Selfknowledge? Even the performer of a pure act, who has no knowledge of the Self, is egoistic. If such be the case, the Rajasic and Tamasic workers are much more egoistic.\n\n### The Characteristics of a Learned Pundit\n\nIn worldly parlance, we speak of a learned Pundit. This Pundit is a very modest and unassuming person, egoless Brahmana.\n\n### A Word of Caution to Arjuna\n\nNow listen, O Arjuna, to the characteristics of action that is of darkness."

He continues to act blindly, setting aside any reflection as to the difficulty of performing the action and what the result of it would be.\n\n### The Characteristics of a Pure Agent\n\nNow, let us listen to the characteristics that pertain to the pure agent.

Pleasant or agreeable sorrow on the attainment of what is not desirable? Pleasant or agreeable? and on having to part with what is desirable. He will be elated with joy when he attains success, and overcome by grief when he fails in his undertaking.\n\n### The Consequences of Being a Passionate Agent\n\nA passionate agent is the embodiment of sin and greed.

It refers to the path that leads individuals towards worldly attachments and desires, ultimately binding them to the cycle of birth and death.\n\n### Nivritti: The Path of Renunciation\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe path of renunciation, or **Nivritti**, is the cause of liberation. It refers to the path that leads individuals towards detachment and renunciation, ultimately freeing them from the cycle of birth and death.\n\n### Karyakarye: The Pure Intellect\n---------------------------------\n\nThe pure intellect, or **Karyakarye**, knows what ought to be done and what ought not to be done at particular places and times. It guides a man who relies on the scriptural ordinances for his daily conduct of life.\n\n### Bhayabhaye: Fear and Fearlessness\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe cause of fear and fearlessness is either visible or invisible. This refers to the state of being that arises from our experiences and perceptions.\n\n### Bondage and Liberation\n---------------------------\n\nBondage and liberation are two interconnected concepts. While bondage refers to the state of being bound or tied down, liberation refers to the state of freedom and release.\n\n### The Nature of Knowledge\n---------------------------\n\nKnowledge is a **Vritti** (function or state) of the intellect. The intellect, on the other hand, is what functions or undergoes the change of state.\n\n### Firmness as a Vritti\n-------------------------\n\nEven firmness is only a particular **Vritti** (modification or state) of the intellect. This highlights the dynamic and changing nature of the intellect.\n\n### Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe threefold nature of knowledge has been described already. Now, the threefold nature of the intellect is described. Knowledge is different from the intellect.\n\n**Quotes**\n\n* \"The path of action, or Pravritti, is the cause of bondage.\"\n* \"The path of renunciation, or Nivritti, is the cause of liberation.\"\n\n**Sattvic Commentary**\n-----------------------\n\nThe threefold nature of knowledge has been described already (verse 22 above). Now the threefold nature of the intellect is described. Knowledge is different from the intellect.\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Pravritti: The path of action, cause of bondage\n* Nivritti: The path of renunciation, cause of liberation\n* Karyakarye: The pure intellect, guides daily conduct\n* Bhayabhaye: Fear and fearlessness, either visible or invisible\n* Bondage and liberation: Two interconnected concepts\n* Knowledge: A Vritti (function or state) of the intellect\n* Intellect: What functions or undergoes the change of state"

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Dharma**\n==========================\n\n18.31 यया by which? धर्मम् Dharma? अधर्मम् Adharma?\n\n### Understanding the Basics of Dharma\n\nDharma is a concept that is difficult to translate directly into English. Some possible translations include \"duty\", \"righteousness\", \"virtue\", and \"law\". However, these translations do not fully capture the essence of Dharma.\n\n**What is Dharma?**\n-------------------\n\nDharma refers to that which elevates you and takes you to the goal. In other words, it is that which connects you with Brahman or the Self.\n\n### The Opposite of Dharma\n\nOn the other hand, Adharma refers to that which hurls you down into the dark abyss of ignorance. This is what prohibits you from achieving your goal.\n\n**Scriptural Ordination**\n-------------------------\n\nWhat is ordained in the scriptures is Dharma, and what is prohibited by them is Adharma. This means that if something is written in the scriptures, it is considered Dharma to follow it.\n\n### The Limitations of a Rajasic Intellect\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA Rajasic intellect is not able to distinguish between right and wrong or to understand the difference between righteous and unrighteous actions. This is because a Rajasic intellect is passionate and driven by desires, rather than being guided by wisdom.\n\n**Ayathavat: Wrongly Contrary to All Authorities**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAyathavat refers to something that is contrary to what is determined by all authorities or men of wisdom or to the highest knowledge. In other words, it refers to something that is done wrongly.\n\n**Key Points**\n-------------\n\n*   **Dharma**: That which elevates you and takes you to the goal.\n*   **Adharma**: That which hurls you down into the dark abyss of ignorance.\n*   **Scriptural Ordination**: What is ordained in the scriptures is Dharma, and what is prohibited by them is Adharma.\n*   **Rajasic Intellect**: Not able to distinguish between right and wrong or to understand the difference between righteous and unrighteous actions.\n*   **Ayathavat**: Contrary to what is determined by all authorities or men of wisdom or to the highest knowledge."

On the other hand, Dharma represents the path of righteousness and morality.\n\n### Characteristics of Adharma\n\nAdharma is characterized by:\n\n* **Regard for evil as good**: It views righteous acts as evil and considers right things to be false.\n* **Perverted view of all things**: It treats everything in a contrary sense and looks upon virtues as if they were vices.\n* **Misinterpretation of scriptures**: It takes everything that the scriptures declare to be good as being entirely wrong.\n\n### Tamasic Nature\n\nTamasic nature is described as follows:\n\n* **Intellect that regards righteousness as evil**: It considers the intellect that regards righteous acts as evil.\n* **Intellect that views virtues as vices**: It treats everything in a perverted light, viewing virtues as if they were vices.\n* **Intellect that misinterprets scriptures**: It takes everything that the scriptures declare to be good as being entirely wrong.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, O Arjuna? I have explained to thee the three aspects of the intellect. Now listen to the explanation of the characteristics of the three aspects of firmness.\n\n**The Three Aspects of Firmness**\n\nAs explained earlier, there are three aspects of the intellect. These aspects are:\n\n1. **Adharma**: The absence of righteousness or moral principles.\n2. **Dharma**: The path of righteousness and morality.\n3. **Tamasic**: A nature that regards righteousness as evil, views virtues as vices, and misinterprets scriptures.\n\nThese three aspects of the intellect are essential to understand in order to make informed decisions and live a virtuous life."

The castes are:\n\n*   **Brahmanas**: The highest caste, comprising priests and scholars who serve as the spiritual leaders of society.\n*   **Kshatriyas**: The warrior caste, comprising rulers and administrators who maintain law and order.\n*   **Vaisyas**: The merchant caste, comprising traders and entrepreneurs who engage in commerce and industry.\n*   **Shudras**: The lowest caste, comprising laborers and service workers who perform menial tasks.\n\n### The Nature of the Castes\n\nThe nature of an individual determines their caste. According to the Bhagavad Gita, \"the nature of a man is Sattva, Rajas, or Tamas\" (Cf.IV.13). The three gunas - Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas - are the fundamental qualities that govern an individual's behavior.\n\n*   **Sattva**: The pure and peaceful nature, associated with the Brahmanas.\n*   **Rajas**: The energetic and ambitious nature, associated with the Kshatriyas.\n*   **Tamas**: The dull and inactive nature, associated with the Shudras.\n\n### The Duties of the Castes\n\nThe duties of each caste are determined by their respective gunas. The castes are:\n\n*   **Brahmanas**: Serve as spiritual leaders and scholars.\n*   **Kshatriyas**: Maintain law and order, rule over others, and engage in warfare.\n*   **Vaisyas**: Engage in commerce and industry, trade, and entrepreneurship.\n*   **Shudras**: Perform menial tasks, such as labor and service.\n\n### Karma and the Gunas\n\nKarma is action arising from past thoughts and desires. The gunas cannot manifest themselves without a cause, which is nature (Svabhava). Nature is the tendency to perform actions based on past experiences and tendencies.\n\n*   **Svabhava**: The natural tendency of an individual, which determines their behavior and actions.\n*   **Samskara**: The accumulated experiences and tendencies of an individual, which manifest themselves in the present birth.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe four castes are a fundamental concept in Hinduism, outlining the social hierarchy and duties of individuals based on their birth.

    "explanation": "**Sahajam: The Nature of Action**\n=====================================\n\n### Born with Oneself or Born with the Birth of Man?\n\nThe verse begins by asking a profound question: \"18.48 सहजम् which is born? कर्म action?\" It inquires about the nature of birth, whether it is born with oneself or with the birth of man. This question sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the nature of action and its relationship to the self.\n\n### The Three Gunas: Faculty for Everything\n\nThe verse states that \"सदोषम् with fault?\" and \"अपि even?\" It highlights the importance of understanding the three Gunas: sattva (good), rajas (passionate), and tamas (dark). These Gunas constitute the faculty for everything, implying that all actions are influenced by these three qualities.\n\n### All Undertakings: Ones Own and Others Duties\n\nThe verse explains that \"सर्वारम्भाः all undertakings\" are comprised of ones own duties as well as the duties of others. It emphasizes that if a Vaisya or Kshatriya performs the duties of a Brahmana, they will not benefit from it. On the other hand, performing another's duty brings fear.\n\n### The Importance of Performing Ones Own Duties\n\nThe verse concludes by stating that \"न not?\" It highlights the importance of performing ones own duties, rather than abandoning action. This is because it is impossible for a man without knowledge of the Self to relinish action totally.\n\n### The Consequences of Abandoning Action\n\nThe final verse states that \"त्यजेत् (one) should abandon?\" It warns against abandoning action, as it is not possible for a man without knowledge of the Self to relinish action totally. This verse serves as a reminder of the importance of performing ones own duties and not abandoning action.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   All undertakings are influenced by the three Gunas: sattva, rajas, and tamas.\n*   Performing ones own duties is essential, while abandoning action can lead to fear and negative consequences.\n*   A man without knowledge of the Self cannot relinish action totally, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nature of action and the self."

Devotion culminates in knowledge. Devotion begins with two and ends in one. ParaBhakti (supreme devotion) and Jnana are one.\n\n**The Mother and the Son**\n-------------------------\n\nDevotion is the mother. Knowledge is the son.

He knows that I am the ruler of all beings. He knows that I am the Supreme Purusha, the controller of Maya, and that this world is a mere appearance.\n\n**The Act of Knowing and Entering**\n---------------------------------\n\nTo know That is to become That.

Words are imperfect and languages are defective. They cannot fully express the inner spiritual experiences.\n\n**The Limitations of Language**\n-------------------------------\n\nThe teacher somehow or other expresses to the students or aspirants these spiritual ideas. The aspirant himself will have to realize the Self. That is beyond the reach of words, expressions, or analogies.\n\n**The Nondual Nature of Brahman**\n---------------------------------\n\nHow can there be similes for that nondual Brahman? These words are a sort of help or prop for the aspirants to lean upon in the beginning to understand spiritual matters.\n\n**The Realization of the Self**\n-------------------------------\n\nWhen he realizes the Self, these words are of no value to him. He himself becomes an embodiment of knowledge.\n\n**The Synonymity of Knowing and Entering**\n------------------------------------------\n\nKnowing is becoming. Knowing is attaining Self-knowledge. These are all the same thing. The act of knowing and the act of entering are not two distinct acts.\n\n**The Difficulty of Understanding**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIt is very difficult to understand or comprehend transcendental spiritual matters.

    "explanation": "**Chapter II, Verse 7: The Lord's Answer to Arjuna's Question**\n\nThe Lord replied to Arjuna's question, \"I ask Thee which may be the better. Tell me that decidedly. I am Thy disciple, suppliant to Thee, teach me.\"\n\n**The Nature of Righteous Deeds**\n\nThis verse is often misunderstood as teaching absolute freedom from all actions. However, the Lord clarifies that taking refuge in Me alone implies the knowledge of unity without any thought of duality. Knowing that there is nothing else except Me, I am the Self of all, dwelling in all.\n\n**The Path to Liberation**\n\nIf thou art established in this faith, I shall liberate thee from all sins. From all bonds of Dharma and Adharma by manifesting Myself as thy own Self.\n\n**The Dharma of the Eye**\n\nTo behold forms is the Dharma of the eye. The support or substratum of all forms is Brahman. When you look at an object, behold Brahman, which is the one essence and abandon the form as it is illusory and unreal.\n\n**Applying this Knowledge**\n\nHave the same attitude towards other objects which pertain to the other senses. Give up the notions of being the doer of actions, enjoying, or being a Brahmana, Brahmachari, endowed with little knowledge and power. Get yourself established in BrahmaBhavana (the understanding or knowledge that I am Brahman). This is what is meant by taking refuge in Lord Krishna, according to the Vedantins.\n\n**The Importance of Surrender**\n\nWork ceaselessly for the Lord, but surrender the fruits of all actions to the Lord. Take the Lord as your sole refuge. Live for Him, work for Him, serve Him in all forms. Think of Him only, meditate on Him alone, see Him in all forms.\n\n**The View of Another School of Thought**\n\nThis is the view of another school of thought, which emphasizes the importance of work and knowledge. However, Sri Sankara strongly refutes this idea, saying that knowledge in conjunction with Karma (action) produces or leads to liberation. He argues that karma helps the man to get purification of the heart, and right knowledge of the Self alone will give him absolute freedom from Samsara.\n\n**The Nature of Karma and Knowledge**\n\nSri Sankara says that work and knowledge are like darkness and light. Action is possible only in this universe of illusory phenomena, which is the projection of ignorance. Knowledge dispels this ignorance.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Taking refuge in Me alone implies the knowledge of unity without any thought of duality.\n* I am the Self of all, dwelling in all.\n* If thou art established in this faith, I shall liberate thee from all sins.\n* To behold forms is the Dharma of the eye, and Brahman is the support or substratum of all forms.\n* Give up the notions of being the doer of actions, enjoying, or being a Brahmana, Brahmachari, endowed with little knowledge and power.\n* Get yourself established in BrahmaBhavana (the understanding or knowledge that I am Brahman).\n* Work ceaselessly for the Lord, but surrender the fruits of all actions to the Lord.\n* Take the Lord as your sole refuge.
