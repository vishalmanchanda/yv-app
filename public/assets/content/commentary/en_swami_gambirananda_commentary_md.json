and similarly, the different results, viz Liberation and enjoyment, belonging  \n***(respectively)***\n to those Knowledge and ignorance, have also been pointed out to be contrary by saying that Liberation is the goal of Knowledge, and enjoyment is the result of ignorance  \n***(see Ka.\n\n..2)***\n.\n\n Vyasa, also has said so: **\n\nNow, there are these two paths**  \n***(Mbh Sa. 24.\n\n6)***\n.and, **There are only these two paths, **.Here  \n***(in the Gita)***\n also, two kinds of steadfastness have been stated.\n\n And it is understood from the Vedas, the Smrtis and reason that ignorance together with its effects has to be destroyed by Knowledge.\n\n As for the Vedic texts, they are: **If one has realized here, then there is truth; if he has not realized here, then there is great destruction**  \n***(Ke.\n\n.5)***\n; **Knowing Him in this way, one becomes Immortal here**  \n***(Nr.\n\n Pu.\n\n 6)***\n; **There is no other path to go by**  \n***(Sv.\n\n.8)***\n; **The enlightened man is not afraid of anything**  \n***(Tai.\n\n..1)***\n.\n\n On the other hand, \n***(the texts)***\n with regard to the unenlightened person are: **Then, he is smitten with fear**  \n***(Tai.\n\n..1)***\n; **Living in the midst of ognorance**  \n***(Ka.\n\n..5)***\n; One who knows Brahman becomes Brahman indeed.\n\n In his line is not born anyone who does not know Brahman**  \n***(Mu.\n\n..9)***\n; **\n***(While he who worships another god thinking, )***\n  \n\u003e He is one, and I am another, \n does not know.\n\n He is like an animal to the gods**  \n***(Br...10)***\n.\n\n He who is a knower of the Self, **He becomes all this  \n***(Universe)***\n**  \n***(Br...10)***\n; **When men will fold up space like  \n***(folding)***\n leather, \n***(then)***\n there will be cessation of sorrow, without knowing the Deity**  \n***(Sv.\n\n.9)***\n.\n\n There are thousands of texts like these.\n\n And the Smrti texts  \n***(from the Gita)***\n are: **Knowledge remains covered by ignorance.\n\n Thery the creatures become deluded**  \n***(.15)***\n; **Here itself is rirth conered by them whose minds are established on sameness**  \n***(.19)***\n; **Since by seeing eally the God who is present alike everywhere  \n***(he does not injure the Self by the Self, therefore he attains the supreme Goal)***\n**  \n***(28)***\n, And as for reason, there is the text, **Men avoid snakes, tips of kusa-grass as also well when they are aware of them.\n\n Some fall into them owing to ignorance.\n\n \n\nThus, see the special result arising from knowledge**  \n***(Mbh.\n\n Sa. 20.\n\n17)***\n.\n\n Similarly, it is known that an unelightened person, who identifies himself with the body.and who practises righteousness and unrighteousness under the impulsion of attachment and aversion, takes birth and dies.\n\n It cannot be reasonably denied by anyone that, those who see the Self as different from the body.become liberated as a result of the cessation of righteous and unrighteous conduct, which depends on the destruction of attachment and aversion.\n\n The being so, the Knower of the field, who is reality is God Himself, appears to have become a mundane soul owing to the various adjuncts which are products of ignorance; as for instance the individual soul becomes identified with the body.For it is a well-known fact in the case of all creatures that their self-identify with the body.which are not-Self is definitely caused by ignorance.\n\n Just as, when a stump, of a tree is firmly regarded as a man, the alities of a man do not thery come to exist in the stump, nor do the alities of the stump come to the person, similarly the property ofconsciousness does not come to the body, nor those of the body to consciousness.\n\n It is not proper that the Self should be identified with happiness, sorrow, delusion, since they, like decrepitude and death, are eally the products of ignorance.\n\n Objection: May it not be said that this is not so, becuase of dissimilarity? The stump and the man, which are verily objects of perception, are superimposed on each other through ignorance by their perceiver.\n\n On the other hand, in the case of the body and the Self, the mutual superimposition occurs verily between a knower and an object of perception.\n\n \n\nThus, the illustration is not eally applicable.\n\n \n\nTherefore, may it not be that the properties of the body, though objects of knowledge, belong to the Self which is the knower? Reply: No, since there arises the contingency of  \n***(the Self)***\n becoming devoid of consciousness! If alities such as happiness, sorrow, delusion, desire, of the body.which are the field and are objects of knowledge, indeed belong to the knower, then it will be necessary to explain the particular reason why some of the alities of the object of knowledge-the field-superimposed through ignorance belong to the Self, while decrepitude, death, do not.\n\n  \n***(On the contrary)***\n it is possible to infer that they  \n***(happiness.)***\n do not pertain to the Self, since, like decrepitude.they are superimposed on the Self through ignorance, and because they are either avoidable or acceptable.\n\n This being so, the mundane state, consisting of agentship and enjoyership pertaining to the objects of knowledge, is superimposed on the knower through ignorance.\n\n Hence, nothing of the knower is affected thery-in the same way as nothing of the sky is affected by the superimposition of surface, diret, \n***(on it)***\n by fools.\n\n Such being the case, not the least touch of the mundane state is to be apprehended with regard to the almighty [see footnote on.5, and.16] God, the Knower of the field, even though He exists in all the fields.\n\n For it is nowhere seen in the world that anybody is benefitted or harmed by a ality attributed to him through ignorance.\n\n As for the statement that the illustration is not eally applicable-that is wrong.\n\n Objection: How? Reply: Because what is intended as common between the illustration and the thing illustrated is merely the superimposition through ignorance.\n\n There is no disagreement as to that.\n\n \n\nHowever, as for your contention that the illustration fails with regard to the Knower, that too has been shown to be inapt by citing the example of decrepitude.[If it be held that objects of experience may be superimposed on one another, but they cannot be superimposed on the experiencer, the answer is that this cannot be a universal proposition.\n\n For decrepitude and death, which are matters of experience, are superimposed on the Self, the experiencer] Objection: May it not be that the Knower of the field becomes a mundane being owing to his having ignorance? Reply: No, because ignorance is of the nature of tamas.\n\n Since ignorance has the nature of covering, it is indeed a notion born of tamas; it makes one perceive contrarily, or it arouses doubt, or it leads to non-perception.\n\n For it disappears with the dawn of discrimination.\n\n And the three kind of ignorance, viz non-perception.[Etc: false perception and doubt], are experienced when there are such defects as blindness.which are forms of tamas and have the nature of veiling.\n\n [It is known through the process of agreement and difference that false perception.arise from some defects, and they are not the alities of the Self] Objection: Here it is asserted that if this be the case, then ignorance is a ality of the knower? Reply: No, for the defects such as blindness are seen to belong to the eye which is an organ.\n\n As for your notion that **ignorance is a ality of the experiencer, and the very fact of being possessed of the ality of ignorance is what constitutes the mundane state of the Knower of the field; the assertion which was made  \n***(by the Vedantin)***\n in that connection, \n\u003e that the Knower of th field is God Himself and not a mundane being, \n is improper, **-this is not so.\n\n As for example: Since such defects as false perception.are seen to belong to the organ eye, therefore false perception.or their causes, viz defects like blindness.do not belong to the perceiver.\n\n Just as blindness of the eyes does not pertain to the perceiver since on being curved through treatment it is not seen in the perceiver, similarly notions like non-perception, false perception, doubt, and their causes should, in all cases, pertain to some organ; not to the perceiver, the Knower of the field.\n\n And since they are objects of perception, they are not alities of the Knower in the same way that light is of a lam.\n\n Just because they are objects of perception, they are cognized as different from one**s own Self.\n\n Besides, it is denied by all schools of thought that in Liberation, when all the organs depart, there is any association with such defects as ignorance.If they  \n***(the defects)***\n be the alities of the Self Itself, the Knower of the field, as heat is of fire, then there can never be a dissociation from them.\n\n Again, since there can be no association with or dissociation from anything for the immutable, formless Self which is all-pervading like space, therefore it is established that the Knower of the field is ever identical with God.\n\n This follows alos from the utternance of the Lord, **Being without beginning and without alities**  \n***(31)***\n, Objection: Well, if this be so, then, owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane creatures, there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the scriptures, Reply: No, since this  \n***(defect)***\n is admitted by all.\n\n A defect that is admitted by all who believe in the Self is not to be explained by one alone! Objection: How has this been admitted by all? Reply: People of all schools of thought who believe in the Self admit that there is no worldly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in the liberated ones.\n\n Yet, in their case  \n***(. in those various schools)***\n, it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a defect as the scriptures becoming useless, Similarly, in our case let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become identified with God; and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance.\n\n This is just as in the case of all the dualists, where it is admitted that the scriptures.become useful in the state of bondage, not in the state of Liberation.\n\n Objection: Well, for us all dualists, bondage and Liberation of the Self are real in the truest sense.\n\n So, when things to be renounced or accepted as also the means thereto are real, the scriptures.become meaningful.\n\n On the other hand, may it not be that for the non-dualists, since duality deos not exist in truest sense, it being the creation of ignorance, therefore the state of bondage of the Self is not ultimately real, and hence the scriptures.become purposeless as they remain shorn of a subject-matter? Reply: No, since it is not logical that the Self should have different states.\n\n If this were possible at all, then the states of bondage and freedom of the Self should be simultaneous, or success.\n\n As to that, they cannot occur simultaneously, since they are contradictory-like rest and motion in the same object.\n\n Should they occur successively and without being caused, then there will arise the contingency of there being no Liberation; if they occur through some cause, then, since they do not exist inherently, there arises the contingency of their being ultimately unre.\n\n In this case also the assumption becomes falsified.\n\n Moreover, when ascertaining the precedence and succession of the states of bondage and Liberation, the state of bondage will have to be considered as being the earlier and having no beginning, but an end.\n\n And that is contrary to valid means of knowledge.\n\n Similarly it will have to be admitted that the state of Liberation has a beginning, but no end- which is certainly opposed to valid means of knowledge.\n\n And it is not possible to established eternality for something that has states nd undergoes a change from one state to another.\n\n On the other hand, if for avoiding the defect of non-eternality the different states of bondage and Liberation be not assumed, then, even for the dualists such defects as the purposelessness of the scriptures become certainly unavoidable.\n\n \n\nThus, the situation being similar  \n***(for both)***\n, it is not for the Advaitin  \n***(alone)***\n to refute the objection.\n\n Nor do the scriptures become purposeless, because the scriptures are applicable to the commonly known unenlightened person.\n\n It is indeed in the case of the ignorant person-not in the case of the enlightened one-that there occurs the perception of identity of the Self with the effect  \n***(. enjoyership)***\n and the cause  \n***(. agentship)***\n which are not-Self.\n\n For, in the case of the enlightened persons, it is impossible that, after the dawn of the realization of non-identity of the Self with effect and cause, they can have Self identification with these as **I**.\n\n Surely, not even a downright fool, or a lunatic and such others, see water and fire or shade and light as identical; what to speak of a discriminating person! \n\nTherefore, such being the case, the scriptures dealing with injunction and prohibition do not concern a person who sees the distinction of the Self from effect and cause.\n\n For, when Devadatta is ordered to do som work with the words, **You do this, ** Visnumitra who happens to be there does not, even on hearing the ?nd, conclude, **I have been ordered.**\n\nBut this conclusion is reasonable when the person for whom the order is meant is not understood.\n\n So also with regard to cause and effect.\n\n Objection: Can it not be that, even after having realized the Self as different from effect and cuase, it is ite reasonable from the standpoint of natural relationship, [Natural relationship-Self-identification with the body through ignorance] that with regard to the scriptures one should have the understanding, **I am enjoined to adotp the means that yields a desired result, and am porhibited from adopting the means that leads to an undesirable result**? As for instance, in the case of a father and son, or between others, even though there exists the awareness of the distinction between each other, still there is the comprehension of the implication of the injunctions and prohibitions meant for one as being also meant for the other.\n\n [In the  \n***(Br. (..17)***\n we read, **\n\nNow therefore the entrusting: When a man thinks he will die, he says to his son, \n\u003e You are Brahman, you are the sacrifice, and you are the world, \n**.It has been enjoined here in this manner that the son should accept as his own all the duties thus entrusted to him by the father.\n\n Similarly, it is understood that when a son in unable to perform his own duties, the father has to accept them.\n\n So also in the case of brothers and others.\n\n \n\nThus, in the case of the enlightened person also, though there is a comprehension of his own distinction from effect and cause, still, owing to his earlier relationship with ignorance, body, there is no contradiction in his understanding that the injunctions and prohibitions are meant for him] Reply: No, since identification of the Self with effect and cause is possible only before attaining the knowledge of the Self as distinct  \n***(from them)***\n.\n\n It is only after one has followed  \n***(or eschewed)***\n what is enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures that he comprehends his own distinction from the effect and cause; not before.\n\n [In..  \n***(..26-7)***\n it is said that the merit earned by the performance of scriptural duties helps to generate knowledge of Brahman.\n\n \n\nTherefore these duties are not meant for the enlightened.\n\n  \n***(By following what is enjoined, and avoiding what is prohibited, one**s mind becomes purified, and then only one understands he is different from cause and effect-agentship and enjoyershi.Tr.)***\n] \n\nTherefore it is established that the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions are meant for the ignorant.\n\n Objection: Well, if  \n***(injunctions and prohibitions)***\n such as, **One who desires heaven shall perform sacrifices**, **One should not eat poisoned meat, **.be not observed by those who have realized the Self as distinct and by those who view only the body as the Self, then, from the absence of any observer of those  \n***(injunctions.)***\n there would follow the uselessness of the scriptures.\n\n Reply: No, because engagement in or abstention from actions follows from what is ordained by the scriptures.\n\n As for one who has realized the identity of the Lord and the knower of the field, one who has realized Brahman-he does not engage in action.\n\n Similarly, even the person who does not believe in the Self does not engage in action, under the idea that the other world does not exist.\n\n \n\nHowever, one who has inferred the existence of the Self on the ground of the wellknown fact that study of the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless, who has no knowledge of the essential nature of the Self, and in whom has arisen hankering for the results of actions-he faithfully engages in action.\n\n This is a matter of direct perception to all to us.\n\n Hence, the scriptures are not purposeless.\n\n Objection: May it not be that the scriptures will become meaningless when, by noticing abstention from action in the case of men with discrimination, their followers too will abstain? Reply: No, because discrimination arises in some rare person only.\n\n For, as at present, some rare one among many people comes to possess discrimination.\n\n Besides, fools do not follow one who has discrimination, because  \n***(their)***\n engagement in action is impelled by defects such as attachment.And they are seen to get engaged in such acts as black magic.\n\n Moreover, engagement in action is natur.\n\n Verily has it been said  \n***(by the Lord)***\n, **But it is Nature that acts**  \n***(.14)***\n.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the mundane state consists of nothing but ignorance, and is an object of perception  \n***(to the ignorant man who sees it)***\n just as it appears to him.\n\n Ignorance and its effects do not belong to the Knower of the feild, the Absolute.\n\n Moreover, false knowledge cannot taint the supreme Reality.\n\n For, water in a mirage cannot taint the supreme Reality.\n\n For, water in a mirage cannot make a desert muddy with its moisture.\n\n Similarly, ignorance cannot act in any way on the Knower of the field.\n\n Hence has this been said, **And understand Me to be knower of the field, ** as also, **Knowledge remains covered by ignorance**  \n***(.15)***\n.\n\n Objection: Then, what is this that even the learned say like the worldly people, **\n\nThus [Possessed of aristorcracy ] am I, ** **This [Body, wife,] verily belongs to Me**? Reply: Listen.\n\n This is that learnedness which consists in seeing the field as the Self! On the contrary, should they realize the unchanging Knower of the field, then they will not crave for enjoyment or action with the idea, **May this be m.**\n\nEnjoyment and action are mere perversions.\n\n This being so, the ignorant man engages in action owing to his desire for results.\n\n On the other hand, in the case of an enlightened person who has realized the changeless Self, engagement in aciton in impossible because of the absence of desire for results.\n\n Hence, when the activities of the aggregate of body and organs cease, his withdrawal from action is spoken of in a figurative sense.\n\n Some may have this other kind of learnedness: **The Knower of the field is God Himself; and the field is something different and an object of knowledge to the Knower of the field.\n\n But I am a mundane being, happy and sorrowful.\n\n And it is my duty to bring about the cessation of worldly existence through the knowledge of the field and the Knower of the field, and by continuing to dwell in His true nature after directly perceiving through meditation God, the Knower of the field, ** and he who, understands thus, and he who teaches that **he  \n***(the taught)***\n is not the Knower of the field, ** and he who, being under such an idea, thinks, **I shall render meaningful the scriptures dealing with the worldly state and Liberation**-is the meanest among the learned.\n\n That Self-immolator, being devoid of any link with the traditional interpreters of the purport of the scriptures, misinterprets what is enjoined in the scriptures and imagines what is not spoken there, and thery himself becoming deluded, befools others too.\n\n Hence, one who is not a knower of the traditional interpretation is to be ignored like a fool, though he may be versed in all the scriptures.\n\n As for the objection that, if God be one with the knower of the field, He will then become a mundane being, and that, if the knowers of the fields are one with God, then from the nonexistence of mundane beings will follow the absence of the mundane state, -these two objections have been refuted by admitting Knowledge and ignorance as having different characteristics.\n\n Objection: How? Reply: By saying that any defect imagined through ignorance does not affect the supreme Reality which is the substratum of that  \n***(imagination)***\n.\n\n In accordance with this an illustration was cited that a desert is not made muddy by water in a mirage.\n\n Even the defect of the possibility of nonexistence of the mundange state, conseent on the nonexistence of individual souls, stands refuted by the explanation that the mundane state and the individual souls are imagined through ignorance.\n\n Objection: The defect of mundane existence in the knower of the field consists in his being possessed of ignorance.\n\n And sorrowfulness.which are its products are matters of direct experience.\n\n Reply: No, since whatever is known is an attribute of the field, therefore the knower-the knower of the field-cannot reasonably be tainted by the defects arising from it.\n\n Whatsoever blemish-not existing in the knower of the field-you attribute to It is logically an object of experience, and hence it is verily a ality of the field; not the ality of the knower of the field.\n\n Nor does the knower of the field become tainted thery, because of knower cannot possibly have any conjunction with an object of knowledge.\n\n Should there be a conjunction, then there will be no possibility at all of its  \n***(the latter**s)***\n becoming a knowable.\n\n Oh! Sir, if being ignorant, sorrowful, be alities of the Self, how is it that they are directly perceived? Or how can they be alities of the Knower of the field? If the conclusion be that all that is known consititutes the field, and that the one who knows is verily the knower of the field, then, to say that being ignorant, sorrowful,are the alities of the knower of the field and that they are directly perceived is a contradictory statement having only ignorance as its basis.\n\n Here, \n***(the opponent)***\n asks: To whom does ignorance belong?  \n***(The answer is that)***\n it belongs verily to him by whom it is experienced! Objection: In whom is it perceived? Reply: Here the answer is: It is pointless to ask, **In whom is ignorance experienced?** Objection: How? Reply: If ignorance be perceived  \n***(by you)***\n, then you perceive its possessor as well.\n\n Moreover, when that possessor of ignorance is perceived it is not reasonable to ask, **In whom is it perceived?** For, when an owner of cattle is seen, the estion, **To whom do the cattle belong**, does not become meaningful.\n\n Objection: Well, is not the illustration dissimilar? Since, the cattle and their owner are directly perceived, their relation also is directly perceived.\n\n Hence the estion is meaningless.\n\n Ignorance and its possessor are not directly perceived in that manner, in which case the estion would have been meaningless.\n\n Reply: What will it matter to you if you know the relation of ignorance with a person who is not directly perceived as possessed of ignorance? Opponent: Since ignorance is a source of evil, therefore it should be got rid of.\n\n Reply: He to whom ignorance belongs will get rid of it! Opponent: Indeed, ignorance belongs to myself.\n\n Reply: In that case, you know ignorance as also yourself who possess it? Opponent: I know, but not through direct perception.\n\n Reply: If you know through inference, then how is the connection  \n***(between yourself and ignorance)***\n known? Surely it is not possible for you the knower to have at that time [**When you are knowing your own ignorance.**] the knowledge of the relation  \n***(of the Self)***\n with ignorance which is an object of knowledge; [**After having perceived ignorance as an object of your knowledge, how can you who continue to be the knower cognize yourself as the knower of that ignorance? For this would lead to the contradiction of the same person becoming the subject and the object of cognition.**] because the cognizer is then engaged in cognizing ignorance as an object.\n\n Besides, there cannot be someone who is a  \n***(separate)***\n cognizer of the relation between the knower and ignorance, and a separate cognition of that  \n***(relation)***\n, for this would lead to infinite regress.\n\n If the knower and the relation between the knower and the thing known be cognizable, then a separate cognizer has to be imagined.\n\n Of him, again, another knower has to be imagined; of him again a separate cognizer would have to be imagined! \n\nThus, an infinite regress be comes unavoidable.\n\n Again, whether the knowable be ignorance or anything else, a knowable is verily a knowable; similarly, even a knower is surely a knower; he does not become a knowable.\n\n And when this is so, [Since the knower cannot be known, therefore his relation with ignorance also cannot be known by himself or by anybody else] nothing of the cognizer-the knower of the field-is tainted by such defects as ignorance, sorrowfulness, Objection: May it not be said that the  \n***(Self**s)***\n defect is surely this, that the field, which is full of defects, is cognized  \n***(by It)***\n? Reply: No, because it is the Immutable, which is consciousness, by nature, that is figuratively spoken of as the cognizer.\n\n It is just like figuratively attributing the act of heating to fire merely because of its  \n***(natural)***\n heat.\n\n Just as it has been shown here by the Lord Himself that identification with action, cause and effect are absent in the Self, and that action, cause, are figuratively attributed to the Self owing to their having been superimposed  \n***(on It)***\n through ignorance, so has it been shown by Him in various places: **He who thinks of this One as the killer৷৷.**\n\n \n***(.19)***\n, **While actions are being done in ever way by the gunas of Nature**  \n***(.27)***\n, **The Omnipresent neither accepts anybody**s sin৷৷.**\n\n \n***(.15)***\n, It has been explained by us, too, in that very way, and in the following contexts also we shall explain accordingly.\n\n Objection: Well, in that case, if identification with action, cause and effect be naturally absent in the Self, and it they be superimpositions through ignorance, then it amounts to this that actions are meant for being undertaken only by the ignorant, not by the enlightened.\n\n Reply: It is true that is comes to this.\n\n This very fact we shall explain under the verse, **Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body৷৷.**\n\n \n***(11)***\n.\n\n And, in the context dealing with the conclusion of the purport of the whole Scripture, we shall explain this elaborately under the verse, **৷৷.\n\nin brief indeed, O son of Kunti, ৷৷.\n\nwhich is the supreme consummation of Knowledge**  \n***(ibid.\n\n 50)***\n It is needless here to expatiate further, Hence we conclude.\n\n The next verse, **\n***(Hear about)***\n৷৷.\n\nwhat that field is, **.summarizing the purport of the chapter dealing with the **field** taught in the verses begining from **This body৷৷.\n\n'.\n\n, is being presented.\n\n For it is proper to introduce briefly the subject-matter that is sought to be explained."

This being so, the Knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence, or it should be an object of a cognition involving the idea of non-existence.\n\n Reply: No, because, by virtue of Its being super-sensuous, It is not an object of cognition involving either, of the two ideas.\n\n Indeed, any object perceivable by the senses, such as pot.can be either an object of cognition involving the idea of existence, or it can be an object of cognition involving the idea of non-existence.\n\n But this Knowable, being supersensuous and known from the scriptures, which are the sole means of  \n***(Its)***\n knowledge, is not, like pot.an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas.\n\n \n\nTherefore It is called neither being nor non-being.\n\n As for your objection that it is contradictory to say, **It is the Knowable, but it is neither called being nor non-being, **-it is not contradictory; for the Upanisad says, **That  \n***(Brahman)***\n is surely different from the known and, again, It is above the unknown**  \n***(Ke.\n\n.4)***\n.\n\n Objection: May it not be that even the Upanisad is contradictory in its meaning?

Reply: No, since the Upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized.\n\n [The Upanisadic text is not to be rejected on the ground that it is paradoxical, for it is meant to present Brahman as indentical with one**s own inmost Self] But, **৷৷.\n\nwhether there exists anything in the other world, **.is merely an arthavada [See note on.4.\n\n Here, the passage, **৷৷.\n\nwhether there exists৷৷.\n\n, **.is to be interpreted as an arthavada emphasizing, the need of raising a shed, irrespective of any other consideration.Tr] connected with an injunction.\n\n From reason who it follows that Brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being, non-being, For, every word used for expressing an object, when heard by listeners, makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension of its significance with the help of genus, action, ality and relation; not in any other way, because that is not a matter of experience.\n\n To illustrate this: a cow, or a horse, \n***(is comprehended)***\n through genus; cooking or reading, through action; white or black, through ality; a rich person or an owner of cows, through relation.\n\n But Brahman does not belong to any genus.\n\n Hence it is not expressible by words like **being**.; neither is It possessed of any alitity with the help of which It could be expressed through alifying words, for It is free from alities; nor can It be expressed by a word implying action, It being free from actions-which accords with the Upanisadic text, **Partless, actionless, calm**  \n***(Sv.\n\n.19)***\n.\n\n Nor has It any relation, since It is one, non-dual, not an object of the senses, and It is the Self.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word.\n\n And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, **From which, words trun back**  \n***(Tai.\n\n..1)***\n, \n\nTherefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word.\n\n And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, **From which, words turn back**  \n***(Tai.\n\n..1)***\n, Since the Knowable  \n***(Brahman)***\n is not an object of the word or thought of **being**, there arises the apprehension of Its nonexistence.\n\n Hence, for dispelling that apprehension by establishing Its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures, the Lord says:"

Reply: No, for the next adducing the reason is meant for eulogy.\n\n Just as, **From renunciation immediately  \n***(follows)***\n Peace**  \n***(12)***\n, is a mere eulogy of renunciation of the fruits of action, it having been enjoined on Arjuna who was unenlightened and incapable of undertaking the various alternatives  \n***(paths)***\n as stated earlier, so also is this sentence, **Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely**  \n***(11)***\n, meant for eulogizing the renunciation of the resorts of all actions.\n\n No one can point an exception to the proposition that **having given up all actions mentally, \n***(the embodied man of self-control)***\n continues happily৷৷.\n\nwithout doing or causing  \n***(others)***\n to do anything at all**  \n***(see.13)***\n.\n\n \n\nTherefore these alternative veiws regarding sannyasa and tyaga are concerned only with those who are alified for rites and duties.\n\n But the enlightened ones who have realized the supreme Truth are competent only for steadfastness in Knowledge, which is characterized by renunciation of all actions; not for anything else.\n\n Hence, they do not come within the purview of the alternative veiws.\n\n \n\nThus has this been pointed out by us in connection with the text, **৷৷.\n\nhe who knows this One as indestructible৷৷.\n\n'  \n***(.21)***\n as also in the beginning of the third chapter."

Reply: There is not such fault, because, the Self being changeless by nature, there is no possiblity of Its becoming united with the locus.For it is only a changeful entity that can possibly be united with another, or come to have agentship through combination.\n\n But, for the changeless Self there can be no combination with anything whatsoever.\n\n Hence, agentship through combination is not logic.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the absoluteness of the Self being natural, the word kevalam is merely a reiteration of an established fact.\n\n And the changelessness of the Self is well known from the Upanisads, the Smrtis and logic.\n\n As to that, in the Gita itself this has been established more than once in such texts as, **It is said that৷৷.\n\nThis is unchangeable**  \n***(.25)***\n, **Actions are being done by the gunas themselves**  \n***(see.27)***\n, **this ৷৷.\n\nsupreme Self does not act৷৷.\n\nalthough existing in the body**  \n***(31)***\n, and in the Upanisads also in such texts as, **It thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were**  \n***(Br...7)***\n.\n\n And from the standpoint of reason also, the royal path is to hold that the true nature of the Self is that It is partless, independent of others and changeless.\n\n Even if mutability  \n***(of the Self)***\n be accepted, It should have a change that is Its own.\n\n The functions of the locus.cannot be attributed to the agency of the Self.\n\n Indeed, an action done by someone else cannot be imputed to another by whom it has not been done! As for what is imputed  \n***(on somody)***\n through ignorance, that is not his.\n\n As the ality of silver is not of nacre, or as surface or dirt attributed through ignorance to the sky by foolish people is not of the sky, similarly, the changes in the locus.also are verily their own, and not of the Self.\n\n Hence it has been well said that the enlightened person **does not kill, nor is he bound**, becuase of the absence of his being tainted by the idea that actions are done by himself.\n\n [Some translate this portion thus: **৷৷.\n\nbecause of the absence of the thought **I am doing**, and also due to the taintlessness of the mind**; or, **৷৷.\n\nin the absence of egotism and of all taint in the mind**.Tr] After having declared, **This One does not kill, nor is It killed**  \n***(.19)***\n; having stated the immutability of the Self through such texts as, **Never is this One born**  \n***(.20)***\n, , which adduce the reason for this; having briefly stated at the commencement of the Scripture-in, **he who knows this One as indestructible**  \n***(.21)***\n-that the enlightened man has no eligibility for rites and duties; and having deliberated in various places on that  \n***(cessation)***\n which has been mooted in the middle  \n***(of the Scripture)***\n, the Lord, by way of summarizing the purport of the Scripture, concludes here by saying that the enlightened person **does not kill, nor does he become bound.\n\n' If this be so, then it becomes established that the three kinds of results of actions, viz the undesirable.do not accrue to the monks, since it is reasonable that, because of the illogicality of their entertaining the idea of being embodied, all actions resulting from ignorance become abandoned  \n***(by them)***\n.\n\n And hence, as a conseence of a reversal of this, it becomes inevitable that the results do accrue to others.\n\n \n\nThus, this is how the purport of the scripture Gita has been summed u.\n\n In order that this which is the essence of the teachings of all the Vedas should be.\n\n understood after deliberation by the learned ones possessing a sharp intellect, it has been explained by us in accordance with the scriptures and reasoning, in various places by dealing with it topically.\n\n Thereafter, now is being stated what promts actions:"

Counter-objection: What follows from this? Opponent: If it be that the duty to which one is born should not be renounced because it is impossible to relinish it totally, then the conclusion that can be arrived at is that complete renunciation  \n***(of duty)***\n is surely meritorious! Counter-objection: Truly so.\n\n But, may it not be that total relinishment is itself an impossibility? Is a person ever-changeful like the gunas of the Sankhyas, or is it that action itself is the agent, as it is in the case of the momentary five [Rupa  \n***(from)***\n, vedana  \n***(feeling)***\n, vijnana  \n***(momentary consciousness)***\n, sanjna  \n***(notion)***\n, samskara  \n***(mental impressions)***\n-these have only momentary existence.\n\n In their case there can be no distinction between action and agent, simply due to the fact of their being momentary] forms of mundane consciousness propounded by the Buddhists? In either case there can be no complete renunciation of action.\n\n Then there is also a third standpoint  \n***(as held by the Vaisesikas)***\n: When a thing acts it is active, and inactive when that very thing does not act.\n\n If this be the case here, it is possible to entirely give up actions.\n\n But the speciality of the third point of view is that a thing is not ever-changing, nor is action itself the agent.\n\n What then? A nonexistent action originates in an existing thing, and an existing action gets destroyed.\n\n The thing-in-itself continues to exist along with its power  \n***(to act)***\n, and that itself is the agent.\n\n This is what the followers of Kanada say.\n\n [Their view is that agentship consists in **possessing the power to act**, not in being the substratum of action] What is wrong with this point of view.\n\n Vedantin: The defect indeed lies in this that, this veiw is not in accord with the Lord**s view.\n\n Objection: How is this known? Vedantin: Since the Lord as said, **Of the unreal there is no being৷৷.\n\n, **.\n***(.16)***\n.\n\n The view of the followers of Kanada is, indeed, this that the non-existent becomes existent, and the existent becomes nonexistent.\n\n Objection: What defect can there be if it be that this view, even though not the view of the Lord, yet conforms to reason? Vedantin: The answer is: This is surely faulty since it contradicts all valid evidence.\n\n Objection: How? Vedantin: As to this, if things like a dvyanuka  \n***(dyad of two anus, atoms)***\n be absolutely nonexistent before origination, and after origination continue for a little while, and again become absolutely non-existent, then, in that acase, the existent which was verily nonexistent comes into being, [Here Ast.\n\n adds, **sadeva asattvam apadyate, that which is verily existent becomes nonexistent**.Tr] a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! If this be the view, then the non-enity that is to take birth is comparable to the horns of a hare before it is born, and it comes into being with the help of what are called material  \n***(inherent)***\n, non-mateial  \n***(non-inherent)***\n and efficient causes.\n\n But it cannot be said that nonexistence has origination in this way, or that it depends on some cause, since this is not seen in the case of nonexistent things like horns of a hare, If such things as pot.which are being produced be of the nature of  \n***(potentially)***\n existing things, then it can be accepted that they originate by depending on some cause which merely manifests them.\n\n [According to Vedanta, before origination a thing, a pot, remains latent in its material cause, clay for instance, with its name and form unexpressed, and it depends on other causes for the manifestation of name and form] Moreover, if the nonexistent becomes existent, and the existent becomes non-existent, then nobody will have any faith while dealing with any of the means of valid knowledge objects of such knowledge, because the conviction will be lacking that the existent is existent and the nonexistent is nonexistent! Further, when they speak of origination, they  \n***(the Viasesikas)***\n hold that such a thing as a dvyanuka  \n***(dyad)***\n comes to have relationship with its own  \n***(material)***\n causes  \n***(the two atoms)***\n and existence, and that it is nonexistent before origination; but later on, depending on the operation of its own causes, it becomes connected with its own causes, viz the atoms, as also with existence, through the inherent  \n***(or inseparable)***\n relationship called samavaya.\n\n After becoming connected, it becomes an existent thing by its inherent relationship with its causes.\n\n [The effect  \n***(dyad)***\n has inherent relationship with existence after its material causes  \n***(the two atoms)***\n come into association] It has to be stated in this regard as to how the nonexistent can have an existent as its cuase, or have relationship with anything.\n\n For nobody can establish through any valid means of knowledge that a son of a barren woman can have any existence or relationship or cause.\n\n Vaisesika: Is it not that relationship of a non-existent thing is not at all established by the Vaisesikas? Indeed, what is said by them is that only existent entities like dvyanuka.have the relationship in the form of samavaya with their own causes.\n\n Vedantin: No, for it is not admitted  \n***(by them)***\n that anything has existence before the  \n***(samavaya)***\n relationship  \n***(occurs)***\n.\n\n It is surely not held by the Vaisesikas that a pot.have any existence before the potter, \n***(his)***\n stick, wheel, start functioning.\n\n Nor do they admit that clay itself takes the shape of a pot.As a result, it has to be admitted  \n***(by them)***\n as the last aternative that nonexistence itself has some relationship! Vaisesika: Well, it is not contradictory even for a nonexistent thing to have the relationship in the form of inherence.\n\n Vedantin: No, because this is not seen in the case of a son of a barren woman.If the antecedent nonexistence  \n***(prag-abhava)***\n of the pot.alone comes into a relationship with its own  \n***(material)***\n cause, but not so the nonexistence of the son of a barren woman.though as nonexistence both are the same, then the distinction between the  \n***(two)***\n nonexistences has to be explained.\n\n Through such descriptions  \n***( of abhava, nonexistence)***\n as nonexistence of one, nonexistence of two, nonexistence of all, antecedent nonexistence, nonexistence after destruction, mutual nonexistence and absolute non-existence, nobody can show any distinction  \n***(as regards nonexistence itself)***\n! There being no distinction, \n***(therefore, to say that:)***\n **it is only the  \n\u003e antecedent nonexistence\n of the pot which takes the form of the pot through the  \n***(action of)***\n the potter and others, and comes into a relationship with the existing pot-halves which are its own  \n***(material)***\n causes and becomes fit for all empirical processes [Such as production, destruction,] but the  \n\u003e nonexistence after destruction\n of that very pot does not do so, though it, too, is nonexistence.\n\n Hence, the  \n\u003e nonexistence after destruction\n, [Etc.\n\n stands for **mutual nonexistence  \n***(anyonya-abhava)***\n** and **absolute nonexistence  \n***(atyanta-abhava)***\n**] are not fit for any empirical processes, whereas only the  \n\u003e antecedent nonexistence\n of things called dvyanuka.is fit for such empirical processes as origination.**-all this is incongruous, since as nonexistence it is indistinguishable, as are **absolute nonexistence** and **nonexistence after destruction**.\n\n Vaisesika: Well, it is not at all said by us that the **antecedent nonexistence** becomes existent.\n\n Vedantin: In that case, the existent itself becomes existent, as for instance, a pot**s becoming a pot, or a cloth**s becoming a cloth.\n\n This, too, like nonexistence becoming existent, goes against valid evidence.\n\n Even the theory of transformation held by the Sankhyas does not differ from the standpoint of the Vaisesikas, since they believe in the origination of some new attribute [ in the origination of a transformation that did not exist before] and its destruction.\n\n Even if manifestation and disappearance of anything be accepted, yet there will be contradiction with valid means of knowledge as before in the explanation of existence or nonexistence of manifestation and disappearance.\n\n Hery is also refuted the idea that origination.\n***(of an effect)***\n are merely particular states of its cuase.\n\n As thelast alternative, it is only the one entity called Existence that is imagined variously through ignorance to be possessed of the states of origination, destruction, like an actor  \n***(on a stage)***\n.\n\n This veiw of the Lord has been stated in the verse, **Of the unreal there is no being৷৷.**\n\n \n***(.16)***\n.\n\n For, the idea of existence is constant, while the others are inconstant.\n\n Objection: If the Self be immutable, then how does the **renunciation of all actions** become illogical? Vedantin: If the adjuncts  \n***(. body and organs)***\n be real or imagined through ignorance, in either case, action, which is their attribute, is surely superimposed on the Self through ignorance.\n\n From this point of view it has been said that an unenlightened person is incapable of totally renouncing actions even for a moment  \n***(cf.\n\n.5)***\n.\n\n The enlightened person, on the other hand, can indeed totally renounce actions when ignorance has been dispelled through Illumination; for it is illogical that there can  \n***(then)***\n remain any trace of what has been superimposed through ignorance.\n\n Indeed, no trace remains of the two moons, superimposed by the vision affected by  \n***(the disease called)***\n Timira when the desease is cured.\n\n This being so, the utterance, **having given up all actions mentally**  \n***(.13)***\n, as also, **Being devoted to his own duty**  \n***(45)***\n and **A human being achieves **success by adoring Him through his own duties  \n***(46)***\n, becomes justifiable.\n\n What was verily spoken of as the success arising from Karma  \n***(yoga)***\n, characterized as the fitness for steadfastness in Knowledge, -the fruit of that  \n***(fitness)***\n, characterized as **steadfastness in Knowledge** consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one  \n***(. a monk)***\n free from duties, has to be stated.\n\n Hence the  \n***(following)***\n verse is begun:"

Of the knowledge of Brahman.\n\n Of what kind is it? It is of the same kind as the realization of the Self.\n\n Of what kind is that? As is the Self.\n\n Of what nature is It? As has been described by the Lord and the Upanisadic texts, and established through reason.\n\n Objection: Is it not that knowledge takes the form of its object? But it is not admitted anywhere that the Self is an object, or even that It has form.\n\n Pseudo-Vedantin: Is it not heard of in such texts as, **radiant like the sun**  \n***(Sv.\n\n.8)***\n, **Of the nature of effulgence**  \n***(..2)***\n and **Self-effulgent**  \n***(Br...9)***\n, that the Self has form? Objection: No, because those sentences are meant for refuting the idea that the Self is of the nature of darkness.\n\n When the Self is denied of possessing forms of substance, ality, the contingency arises of the Self**s being of the nature of darkness.\n\n The sentences, **radiant like the sun, **.are meant for ruting this.\n\n And this follows from the specific denial of from by saying, **Formless**  \n***(Ka.\n\n..15)***\n, and from such texts as, **His form does not exist within the range of vision; nobody sees Him with the eye**  \n***(Ka.\n\n..9: Sv.\n\n.20)***\n, **soundless, touchless**  \n***(ka.\n\n..15)***\n, which show that the Self is not an object of perception.\n\n \n\nTherefore it remains unproved that there can be any knowledge which takes the form of the Self.\n\n How, then, can there be the knowledge of the Self? For, all knowledge that there can be with regard to objects assumes their respective forms.\n\n And it has been said that the Self has no form.\n\n Moreover, if both knowledge and the Self be formless, then how can there be the consummation [Firmness in Self-realization] of the  \n***(repeated)***\n contemplation on that  \n***(knowledge of the Self)***\n? Vedantin:.Since it can be established that the Self is supremely taintless, pure and subtle, and it can also be established that the intellect can have taintlessness.like the Self, therefore it stands to reason that the intellect can take a form resembling the consciousness of the Self.\n\n The mind becomes impressed with the semblance of the intellect; the organs become impressed with the semblance of the mind; and the body becomes impressed with the semblance of hte organs.\n\n Hence it is that the idea of the body itself being the Self is held by ordinary people.\n\n The Lokayatikas  \n***(materialists)***\n, who hold that the body is identical with consciousness, say that a person is a body endowed with consciousness; so also there are others who say that the organs are identical with consciousness; there are others who say that the mind is identical with consciousness, and still others who say that the intellect is identical with consciousness.\n\n Some accept as the Self the Unmanifest [The inmost Ruler  \n***(antaryamin)***\n, possessing a semblance of Consciousness], called the Undifferentiated, which is more internal than that  \n***(intellect)***\n and is within the domain of  \n***(primordial)***\n ignorance.\n\n Indeed, in every case, beginning from the intellect to the body, the cause of mis-conceived Selfhood is the semblance of the Consciousness that is the Self.\n\n Hence, knowledge about the Self is not a subject for injunction.\n\n What then? Only the eradication of the superimposition of name, form, which are not the Self, is what has to be undertaken, but not the knowledge of the Self that is Consciousness.\n\n For it is the Self which is experienced as possessed of the forms of all the various objects that are superimposed  \n***(on It)***\n through ignorance.\n\n It is evidently because of this that the Buddhists who uphold the view of  \n***(momentary)***\n consciousness have concluded that there is no substance at all apart from  \n***(momentary)***\n consciousness, and that it is not in need of any other valid proof since they hold that it is self-cognized.\n\n \n\nTherefore, what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on Brahman through ignorance, but no effort is needed for knowing Brahman  \n***(Consciousness)***\n, for It is ite self-evident! It is because the intellect is distracted by particular appearances of name and form imagined through ignorance that Brahman, even though self-evident, easily realizable, nearer than all else and identical with oneself, appears to be concealed, difficult to realize, very far and different, But to those whose intellect has become free from external appearances and who have obtained the grace of a teacher and serenity of mind, there is nothing more blissful, manifest, well known, easily realized and nearer to oneself than this Self.\n\n And thus it has been declared, **directly realizable, righteous, **.\n***(.2)***\n.\n\n \n\nHowever, some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot comprehend the entity called the Self since It is formless; hence, complete steadfastness in Knowledge is impossible.\n\n This is truly so for those who have not associated with a traditional line of teachers; who have not heard the Upanisads; whose intellects are too much engrossed with external objects; and who have not applied themselves diligently to the perfect means of knowledge.\n\n For those, on the other hand, who are the opposite of these, it is absolutely impossible to have the idea of reality with regard to empirical objects, which are within the realm of duality involving the knower and the known, because in their case there is no perception of any other thing apart from the Consciousness that is the Self.\n\n We have already said how this is certainly so and not otherw.\n\n It has been stated by the Lord also, **That during which creatures keep awake, it is night to the seeing sage**  \n***(.69)***\n.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the cessation of the perception of differences in the form of external things is alone the cause of resting in the reality of the Self.\n\n For, that which is called the Self is never an object which is not well known, attainable, rejectable or acceptable to anyone at any t.\n\n Were that Self to be indeed not self-evident, all activities would become meaningless.\n\n [According to Ast.\n\n the latter portion of this sentence is: svarthah sarvah pravrttayah vyarthah prasajyeran, all activities meant for one**s own benefit would become meaningless.Tr].\n\n For it cannot be imagined that they could be undertaken for unconscious objects like the body.Besides, it cannot be that pleasure is for pleasure**s sake, or that sorrow is for sorrow**s sake.\n\n Moreover, all empirical dealings are meant for culminating in the realization of the Self.\n\n [According to....26, **On the strength of the Upanisadic sanction of sacrifices.all religious activities as well are necessary৷৷.\n\n**, sacrifices.are meant for leading to the realization of the Self, without which they would become meaningless] \n\nTherefore, just as for knowing one**s own body there is no need of any other  \n***(external)***\n means of knowledge so also there is no need of any other means of knowledge, for the realization of the Self which is innermost  \n***(in relation to the body.)***\n.\n\n Hence it is established that steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self is a fact very well known to the discriminating people.\n\n Even to those who hold that knowledge is formless and not cognized by direct perception, cognition of an object is dependent on knowledge.\n\n Hence it has to be admitted that knowledge is as immediate as pleasure.And this follows also from the impossibility of a desire to know  \n***(knowledge)***\n.\n\n Had knowledge been not self-evident, it could have been sought for like any object of knowledge.\n\n And in that case, as [This is Ast.\n\n**s reading; others read tatha.Tr] a knower seeks to perceive through knowledge such objects of knowledge as pot.similarly the knower would have sought to perceive knowledge through another knowledge! But this is not the case.\n\n \n\nTherefore knowledge is ite self-revealing, and for the very same reason the knower also is self-revealed.\n\n Hence, effort is not needed for knowledge, but only for the removal of the notion of what is not-Self.\n\n [In place of anatma-buddhi-nivrttau, Ast.\n\n has **anatmani atma-buddhi-nivrttau, for the termination of thinking what is not the Self as the Self'.Tr] Conseently, steadfastness in Knowledge is easy of accomplishment.\n\n It is being stated how this supreme consummation of Knowledge is to be attained:"

Vedantin: Well, the resut will verily be this: The ascertainment of one of these as the cuase of the highest good.\n\n Hence this has to be investigated more extensively.\n\n Knowledge of the Self, however, is exclusively the cause of the highest good; for, through the removal of the idea of differences, it culminates in the result that is Liberation.\n\n The idea of distinction among action, agent and result is ever active with regard to the Self because of ignorance.\n\n This ignorance in the form, **My work; I am the agent; I shall do this work for that resut**, has been at work from time without beginning.\n\n The dispeller of this ignorance is this Knowledge regarding the Self-in the form, **I am the absolute, non agent, free from action and result; there is none else other than myself because, when it  \n***(Knowledge)***\n arises it despels the idea of differences which is the cause of engagement in action.\n\n The word **however** above is used for ruling out the other two alternatives.\n\n This refutes the two other alternative views by showing that the highest good cannot be attained through mere actions, nor by a combination of Knowledge and action.\n\n Besides, since Liberation is not a product, therefore it is illogical that it should have action as its means.\n\n Indeed, an eternal entity cannot be produced by either action of Knowledge.\n\n Objection: In that case, ever exclusive Knowledge is purposeless.\n\n Vedantin: No, since Knowledge, being the destroyer of ignorance, culminates in Liberation which is directly experienced result.\n\n The fact that Knowledge, which removes the darkness of ignorance, culminates in Liberation as its result is directly perceived in the same way as is the result of the light of a lamp which removes ignorance the form of sanke.and darkness from objects such as rope.Indeed, the result of light amounts to the mere  \n***(awareness of the)***\n rope, free from the wrong notions of snake.So is the case with Knowledge.\n\n As in the case of the acts like **cutting down**, **producing fire by friction**.in which accessories such as the agent and others operate, and which have perceivable results, there is no possiblity of  \n***(the agent.)***\n engaging in any other activity giving some other result apart from **splitting into two**, **seeing  \n***(or lighting of)***\n fire** etc, similarly, in the case of the agent and the other factors engaged in the **act** of steadfastness in Knowledge which has a tangible result, there is no possibility of  \n***(their)***\n engagement in any other action which has a result different from that in the form of the sole existence of the Self.\n\n Hence, steadfastness in Knowledge combined with action is not logic.\n\n Objection: May it not be argued that this is possible like the acts of eating and Agnihotra sacrifice.? [As such a common action as eating can go hand in hand with such Vedic rites as the Agnihotra-sacrifice, so, actions can be combined with Knowledge] Vedantin: No, since it is unreasonable that, when Knowledge which resutls in Liberation is attained, there can remain a hankering for results of actions.\n\n Just as there is no desire for an action or its result [Action, digging.; result, bathing ] in connection with a well, pond, when there is a flood all around, similarly when Knowledge which has Liberation for its result is attained there can be no possibility of hankering for any other result or any action which leads to it.\n\n Indeed, when somody is engaged in actions aimed at winning a kingdom, there can be no possibility of his engaging in any activity for securing a piece of land, or having a longing for it! Hence, action does not constitute the means to the highest good.\n\n Nor do Knowledge and action in combination.\n\n Further, Knowledge which has Liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of action, because, being the remover of ignorance, it is opposed  \n***(to action)***\n.\n\n Verily, darkness cannot be the dispeller of darkness.\n\n \n\nTherefore Knowledge alone is the means to the highest good.\n\n Objection: Not so, because from non-performance of nityakarmas one incurs sin.\n\n Besides, freedom  \n***(of the Self)***\n is etern.\n\n As for the view that Liberation is attainable through Knowledge alone, it is wrong.\n\n For, if nityakarmas [As also the occasional duties  \n***(naimittika-karmas)***\n] which are prescribed by the Vedas are not performed, then one will incur evil in the form of going to hell.Counter-objection: If this be so, then, since Liberation cannot come from action, will there not arise the contingency of there being no Liberation at all? Pseudo-Vedantin: Not so, for Liberation is etern.\n\n as a result of performing nityakarmas there will not be incurring of evil, and as a result of not doing any prohibited action  \n***(nisiddha-karma)***\n there will not be any possibility of birth in an undesirable body; from relinishing actions meant for desired results  \n***(kamya-karmas)***\n there will be no possibility of being born in some desirable body.\n\n Since there is no cause to produce another body when the present body falls after the results of actions that produced this body get exhausted by experiencing them, and since one does not have attachment.therefore Liberation consists in the mere continuance of the Self in Its own natural state.\n\n \n\nThus, Liberation is attained without effort.\n\n Objection: May it not be argued that, since in the case of actions done in many past lives-which are calculated to yield such results as attainment of heaven, hell, but have not commenced bearing results-there is no possiblity of their being experienced, therefore they cannot be exhausted? Pseudo-Vedantin: No, since the suffering of pain from the effort involved in the nityakarmas can reasonably be  \n***(considered to be)***\n the experiencing of their [ of actions done in past lives, which have not commenced bearing their fruits.Tr] results.\n\n Or, since the nityakarmas, like expiations, may be considered as being meant for eliminating the sins incurred earlier, and since actions that have begun bearing their fruits get exhausted merely through their being experienced, therefore Liberation is attained without effort-provided no fresh actions are performed.\n\n Vedantin: No, since there is the Upanisadic text, **Knowing Him alone, one goes beyond death; there is no other way to go by**  \n***(Sv.\n\n.8)***\n, which states that for Liberation there is no other path but enlightenment; also because there is the Upanisadic statement that Liberation for an unenlightened person is as impossible as the rolling up of the sky like leather  \n***(Sv.\n\n.20)***\n; and since it is mentioned in the Puranas and the Smrtis that Liberation follows only from Knowledge.\n\n  \n***(From your view)***\n it also follows that there is no possibility of the exhaustion of the results of virtuous deeds which have not as yet begun yielding their fruits.\n\n And, as there is the possibility of the persistence of sins which were incurred in the past but have not yet commenced yielding results, similarly there can be the possibility of the persistence of virtues which have not yet begun bearing fruits.\n\n And so, if there be no scope of their being exhausted without creating another body, then there is no possibility of Liberation.\n\n And since attachment, hatred and delusion, which are the causes of virtue and vice, cannot be eradicated through any means other than Knowledge, therefore the eradication of virtue and vice becomes impossible.\n\n Besides, since the Sruti [See...2.\n\n1 and Br...16-Tr] mentions that nityakarmas have heaven as their result, and there is the Smrti text, **Persons belonging to castes and stages of life, and engaged in their own duties** [**৷৷.\n\nattain to a high, immeasurable happiness.\n\n**-Tr]  \n***(A.\n\n Dh.\n\n Su....3)***\n, therefore the exhaustion of  \n***(the fruits of)***\n actions  \n***(through nityakarmas)***\n is not possible.\n\n As for those who say, **The nityakarmas, being painful in themselves, must surely be the result of evil deeds done in the past; but apart from being what they are, they have no other result because this is not mentioned in the Vedas and they are enjoined on the basis of the mere fact that one is alive**-\n***(this is)***\n not so, because actions which have not become operative cannot yield any result.\n\n Besides, there is no ground for experiencing a particular conseence in the form of pain [Pain involved in the performance of nityakarmas] The statement, that the pain one suffers from the effort involved in performing the nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in past lives, is false.\n\n Indeed, it does not stand to reason that the result of any action which did not become operative at the time of death to yield its fruit is experienced in a life produced by some other actions.\n\n Otherwise, there will be no reason why the fruit of some action that is to lead to hell should not be experienced in a life that is produced by such actions as Agnihotra.and is meant for enjoying the result in the form of heaven! Besides, that  \n***(pain arising from the effort in performing nityakarmas)***\n cannot be the same as the conseence in the form of the particular suffering arising from sin.\n\n Since there can be numerous kinds of sins with results productive of various kinds of sorrows, therefore, if it be imagined that their  \n***(sins**)***\n result will be merely in the form of pain arising from the effort in undertaking the nityakarmas, then it will certainly not be possible to suppose that they  \n***(the sins incurred in the past)***\n are the causes of such obstacles as the pairs of opposites  \n***(heat and cold,)***\n, disease.and that the result of sins incurred in the past will be only the pain arising from the exertion in performing nityakarmas, but not the sufferings like carrying stones on the head.Further, it is out of context to say this, that the pain resulting from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in the past.\n\n Objection: How? Vedantin: What is under discussion is that the sin committed in the past, which has not begun to bear fruit, cannot be dissipated.\n\n In that context you say that pain resulting from the effort in undertaking nityakarmas is the result of action which has begun bearing fruit, not of that which has not yet commenced yielding fruit! On the other hand, if you think that all sins committed in the past have begun yielding their results, then it is unreasonable to specify that the pain resulting from the exertion in performing the nitya-karmas is their only result.\n\n And there arises the contingency of the injunction to perform nityakarmas becoming void, because the sinful deed which has begun bearing fruit can ligically be dissipated only be experiencing its result.\n\n Further, if pain be the result of nityakarmas enjoined by the Vedas, then it is seen to arise from the very effort in undertaking nityakarmas-as in the case of excercise.To imagine that it is the result of something else is illogic.\n\n [The pain arising from bodily excercise is the result of the excercise itself, and not the result of any past sin! Similarly, the pain resulting from undertaking nityakarmas is the conseence of that performance itself, and need not be imagined to be the result of any past sin] And if the nityakarmas have been enjoined simply on the basis of a person**s being alive, it is unreasonable that it should be the result of sins committed in the past, any more than expiation is.\n\n An expiation that has been enjoined following a particular sinful act is not the result of that sin! On the other hand, if the suffering arising from expiation be the reslut of that very sin which is its cause, then the pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas, though prescribed merely on the fact of one**s being alive, may become the fruit of that very fact of one**s being alive-which was itself the occasion  \n***(for enjoining the nityakarmas)***\n- because both the nityakarmas and expiatory duties are indistinguishable so far as their being occasioned by something is concerned.\n\n Moreover, there is the other fact: There can be no such distinction that only the pain resulting from the performance of nityakarmas is the result of past sinful deeds, but not so the pain from performing kamya-karmas  \n***(rites and duties undertaken for desired results)***\n, because the pain in performing Agnihotra-sacrifice.is the same when it is performed as a nityakarma or as a kamya-karma.\n\n \n\nThus the latter also may be the result of past sinful acts.\n\n This being the case, it is untenable to assume on the ground of circumstantial inference that, since no result is enjoined in the Vedas for nityakarmas and since its prescription cannot be justified on any other ground, therefore pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful past deeds.\n\n \n\nThus, the  \n***(Vedic)***\n injunction being unjustifiable otherwise, it can be inferred that nityakarmas have got some result other than the pain arising from the effort in undertaking them.\n\n It also involves this contradiction: It is contradictory to say that through the performance of nityakarma a result of some other action is experienced.\n\n And when this is admitted, it is again a contradiction to say that that very experience is the result of the nityakarma, and yet that niyakarma has no result! Moreover, when Agnihotra and other sacrifices are performed for desirable results  \n***(Kamya-Agnihotra)***\n, then the Agnihotra.which are performed as nityakarma  \n***(Nitya-Agnihotra)***\n become accomplished simultaneously  \n***(on a account of its being a part ofthe former)***\n.\n\n Hence, since the Kamya-Agnihotra  \n***(as an act)***\n is dependent on and not different from the Nitya-Agnihotra, therefore the result of the Agnihotra and other sacrifices performed with a desire for results will get exhausted through the suffering involved in the exertion in undertaking it  \n***(the Nitya-Agnihotra)***\n.\n\n On the other hand, if the result of Kamya-Agnihotra.be different, viz heaven.then even the suffering arising from the exertion in performing them ought to be necessarily different  \n***(from the suffering involved in the Nitya-Agnihotra)***\n.\n\n And that is not the fact, because it contradicts what is directly perceived; for the pain resulting from the effort in performing only the Nitya-\n***(Agnihotra)***\n does not differ from the pain resulting from the exertion in undertaking the Kamya  \n***(Agnihotra)***\n.\n\n Besides, there is this other consideration: Actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited  \n***(by the scriptures)***\n produce immediate results.\n\n But those enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results; were they to do so, then there would be no effort even with regard to heaven.and injunctions concerning unseen results.\n\n And it cannot be imagined that only the fruit of  \n***(Nitya-)***\n Agnihotra.gets exhausted through the suffering arising from the effort in performing them, but the Kamya  \n***(Agnihotra)***\n has exalted results like heaven.merely as a conseence of the fact of desire for results, though as acts there is no essential difference between them  \n***(the Nitya and the Kamya)***\n and there is no additional subsidiary part, processes of performance, \n***(in the kamya-Agnihotra)***\n.\n\n \n\nTherefore, it can never be established that nitya-karmas have no unseen results.\n\n And hence, enlightenment alone, not the performance of nityakarmas, is the cuase of the total dissipation of actions done through ignorance, be they good or bad.\n\n For, all actions have for their origin ignorance and des.\n\n \n\nThus has it been established  \n***(in the following passages)***\n that action  \n***(rites and duties)***\n is meant for the ignorant, and steadfastness in Knowledge-after renunciation of all actions-is meant for the enlightened: **both of them do not know**  \n***(.19)***\n; **he who knows this One as indestructible, eternal**  \n***(.21)***\n; **through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis**  \n***(.3)***\n; **the ignorant, who are attached to work**  \n***(.26)***\n; **But৷৷.\n\nthe one who is a knower৷৷.\n\ndoes not become attached, thinking thus:  \n\u003e The organs rest on the objects of the organs\n**  \n***(.28)***\n; **The embodied man৷৷.\n\nhaving given up all actions mentally, continues**  \n***(.13)***\n; **Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, \n\u003e I certainly do not do anything\n**  \n***(.8)***\n; i.\n\ne; the unenlightened person thinks, **I do**; **For  \n***(the sage)***\n who wishes to ascend  \n***(to Dhyana-yoga)***\n, action is said to be the means৷৷.\n\nwhen he has ascended  \n***(when he is established in the Yoga of Meditation)***\n, inaction alone is said to be the means**  \n***(.3)***\n; **noble indeed** are all the three  \n***(classes of)***\n unenlightened persons, **but the man of Knowledge is the very Self.\n\n  \n***(This is)***\n My opinion**  \n***(.18)***\n; the unenlightened who perform their rites and duties, **who are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of going and returning**  \n***(.21)***\n; **becoming non-different from Me and meditative**  \n***(.22)***\n and endowed with steadfast devotion, they worship  \n***(Me)***\n the Self which has been described as comparable to space and taintless; and **I grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach Me**  \n***(10)***\n;.the unenlightened persons who perform rites and duties **do not reach Me.**\n\nThose who perform works for the Lord and who, though they be the most devout, are ignorant persons performing rites and duties, -they remain involved in practices which, in a descending order, culminate in giving up the fruit of actions  \n***(cf.\n\n 6-11)***\n.\n\n But those who meditate on the indefinable Immutable take recourse to the disciplines stated in the passages beginning with **He who is not hateful towards any creature**  \n***(13)***\n and ending with that Chapter, and also resort to the path of Knowledge presented in the three chapters beginning with the Chapter on the **field**.\n\n The three results of actions, viz the undesirable.\n***(cf.\n\n 12)***\n, do not accrue only to the mendicants belonging to the Order of Paramahamsas  \n***(the highest Order of monks)***\n-who have renounced all actions that originate from the five causes beginning with the locus  \n***(cf.\n\n 14)***\n, who possess the knowledge of the oneness and non-agentship of the Self  \n***(17, 20)***\n, who continue in the supreme steadfastness in Knowledge, who know the real nature of the Lord, and who have taken refuge in the unity of the real nature of the Lord with the Self.\n\n It does accrue to the others who are not monks, the ignorant persons who perform rites and duties.\n\n Such is this distinction made in the scripture Gita with regard to what is duty and what is not.\n\n Objection: May it not be argued that it cannot be proved that all actions are due to ignorance? Reply: No, \n***(it can be proved, )***\n as in the case of slaying a Brahmin.\n\n Although the nityakarmas are known from the scriptures, still they are meant only for the ignorant.\n\n As such an action as killing a Brahmin, even though known to be a source of evil from the scripture prohibiting it, is still perpetrated by one who has defects such as ignorance, passion,because impulsion to any action is otherwise not possible- so also is it with regard to the nitya, naimittika and kamya actions.\n\n Objection: May it not be held that impulsion to nityakarma.is not possible if the Self be not known as a distinct entity? [Unless one knows the Self to be distinct from the body.he will not perform the nityakarmas.meant for results in the other worlds, viz heaven.\n***(Tr.)***\n In place of vyatiriktatmani, Ast.\n\n reads **deha-vyatiriktatmani, the Self which is distinct from the body**] Reply: No, since it is seen that with regard to actions which are of the nature of motion and are accomplished by the not-Self, one engages in them with the idea, **I do.**\n\n[The actionless Self is not the agent of the movements of the body.Still agentship is superimposed on It through ignorance] Objection: Can it not be said that the notion of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body.occurs in a figurative sense; it is not false? Reply: No, since its effects [ the effects of the notion of egoism] also will become figurat.\n\n Objection: The notion of **I** with regard to the aggregate of one**s own body.occurs in a figurative sense.\n\n As with regard to one**s own son it is said  \n***(in the Veda)***\n, **It is you yourself who is called the son**  \n***(Sa. Br...26)***\n, and in common parlance also it is said, **This cow is my very life**, so is the case here.\n\n [As the use of the word **I** with regard to a son is figurative, so also with regard to the body] This is certainly not a false notion.\n\n \n\nHowever, a false notion  \n***(of identity)***\n occurs in the case of a stump and a man, when the distinction between them is not evident  \n***(due to darkness)***\n.\n\n Reply: A figuratively expressed notion cannot lead to an effect in the real sense, because that  \n***(notion)***\n is used for the eulogy of its basis with the help of a word of comparison which remains understood.\n\n As for instance, such sentences as, **Devadatta is a lion**, **The boy is a fire**-implying **like a lion**, **like a fire**, on the basis of the similarity of cruelty, the tawny colour,are meant only for eulogizing Devadatta and the boy who are the basis  \n***(. the subjects of the two sentences)***\n.\n\n But no action of a lion or a fire is accomplished because of the use of the figurative words or ideas.\n\n On the contrary, one experiences the evil effects of false notions.\n\n [\n\nTherefore the idea of **I** with regard to one**s body.does not occur in a secondary sense, but it does so falsely] And with regard to the subjects of the figurative notions, one understands, **This Devadatta cannot be a lion; this boy cannot be a f.**\n\nSimilarly, actions done by the aggregate of body.which is the **Self** in a figurative sense, cannot be held to have been done by the Self which is the real subject of the notion of **I**.\n\n For, actions done by the figurative lion or fire cannot be considered to have been accomplished by the real lion or f.\n\n Nor is any action of the real lion and fire accomplished through the  \n***(figurative)***\n cruelty or tawnyaness; for, their purpose is fully served by being used for eulogy.\n\n And those who are praised know, **I am not a lion; I am not fire; and neither is the work of a lion or fire m.**\n\nSo the more ligical notion is, **The action of the aggregate  \n***(of body.)***\n do not belong to me who am the real Self**, and not, **I am the agent; it is my work.**\n\nAs for the assertion made by some that the Self acts through Its own memory, deisre and effort, which are the causes of activity-that is not so, for they are based on false knowledge.\n\n Memory, desire, effort, indeed follow from the tendencies born from the experience of the desirable and the undesirable results of actions  \n***(which actions themselves arise from the notions of the **desirable** and the **undesirable**)***\n caused by false knowledge.\n\n [False knowledge gives rise to the ideas of the desirable and the undesirable.\n\n From these arise desire and repulsion.\n\n Actions which follow give rise to the experience of their desirable and undesirable results.\n\n Such experiences create impressions in the mind, from which are born memory ] Just as in this life virtue, vice and the experience of their results are cuased by the identification  \n***(of the Self)***\n with the aggregate of body.and attraction, repulsion, so also was it in the previous birth, and even in the life preceding that.\n\n \n\nThus it can be inferred that past and future mundane existence is without beginning and is a product of ignorance.\n\n And from this it becomes proved that the absolute cessation of mundane existence is caused by steadfastness in Knowledge, accompanied by renunciation of all rites and duties.\n\n Besides, since self-identification with the body is nothing but ignorance, therefore, when the  \n***(ignorance)***\n ceases, there remains so possibility of re-birth, and so, mundane existence becomes impossible.\n\n The identification of the Self with the aggregate of body.is nothing but ignorance, because in common life it is not seen that anybody who knows, **I am different from cattle.and the cattle.are different from me**, entertains the notion of **I** with regard to them.\n\n \n\nHowever, mistaken perceiving a stump to be a man, one may out of indiscrimination entertain the idea of **I** with regard to the aggregate of body.; not so when perceiving them as distinct.\n\n As for that notion of considering the son to be oneself-as mentioned in, **It is you yourself who is called the son**  \n***(Sa. Br...26)***\n- that is a metaphor based on the relationship between the begotten and the begetter.\n\n And no real action like eating.can be accomplished through something considered metaphorically as the Self, just as actions of the real lion or fire  \n***(cannot be accomplished)***\n by someone metaphorically thought of to be a lion or f.\n\n Objection: Since an injunction relating to an unseen result is valid, therefore, may it not be said that the purposes of the Self are accomplished by the body and organs which are figuratively considered to be the Self? Reply: No, since the thinking of them as the Self is the result of ignorance.\n\n The body, organs, are not the Self in a figurative sense.\n\n Objection: How then? Reply: Although the Self is devoid of relationship, still, by an ascription of relationship  \n***(to the Self)***\n, they  \n***(body.)***\n come to be regarded as the Self, verily through a false notion.\n\n For, this identification  \n***(of body.)***\n with the Self exists so long as the false notion is there, and ceases to exist when it is not there.\n\n So long as ignorance lasts, identification of the Self with the aggregate of body and organs is seen only in the case of non-discriminating, immature, ignorant poeple who say, **I am tall**, **I am fair**.\n\n But in the case of discriminating persons who possess the knowledge, **I am different from the aggregate of body.**, there does not arise the idea of egoism with regard to the body.at that time  \n***(. simultaneously with that knowledge)***\n.\n\n Hence, since it  \n***(. identification of the Self with the body.)***\n ceases in the absence of the false notion, therefore it is a creation of that  \n***(false notion)***\n, and not a figurative notion.\n\n It is only when the common and the uncommon features of the lion and Devadatta, or of fire and the boy, are known distinctly, that a figurative notion or verbal expression can occur; not when the common and the uncommon features are unknown.\n\n As for the argument that  \n***(the figurative notion should be accepted)***\n on the authority of the Vedas, we say, **No**, because their validity concerns unseen results.\n\n The validity of the Vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation between ends and means of Agnihotra.which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception; but not with regard to objects of direct perception.because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct perception.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is not possible to imagine that the idea of egism with regard to the aggregate of body.arising from an obviously of false knowledge, is a figurative notion.\n\n Surely, even a hundred Vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or non-luminous! Should a Vedic text say that fire is cold or non-luminous, even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different, for otherwise  \n***(its)***\n validity cannot be maintained; but one should not assume its meaning in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement.\n\n Objection: May it not be said that since actions are undertaken by one possessed of a false idea of agentship, therefore, when the agent ceases to be so [**According to you  \n***(the Vedantin)***\n, an ignorant man alone can be an agent.\n\n \n\nTherefore, when he becomes illumined, he will cease to be ignorant and conseently the Vedas will cease to be valid for him.**] the Vedas will become invalid? Reply: No, since the Vedas become logically meaningful in respect of knowledge of Brahman.\n\n [Though the Vedic injunctions about rituals.be inapplicable in the case of an enlightened person, still they have empirical validity before enlightenment.\n\n Besides, the Vedas have real validity with regard to the knowledge of Brahman] Objection: May it not be said that there arises the contingency of the Vedic texts enjoining knowledge of Brahman becoming as invalid as those texts enjoining rites and duties? Reply: No, since there cannot possibly be any notion which can remove  \n***(the knowledge of Brahman)***\n.\n\n Unlike the manner in which the idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body.is removed after the realization of the Self from hearing the Vedic injunctions regarding the knowledge of Brahman, the realization of the Self in the Self can never be removed in any way in that manner by anything whatsoever-just as the knowledge that fire is hot and luminous is irremovable- since  \n***(Self-)***\n realization is inseparable from its result  \n***(. cessation of ignorance)***\n.\n\n Besides, the Vedic texts enjoining rites  \n***(and duties)***\n.are not invalid, because they, through the generation of successively newer tendencies by eliminating the successively preceding tendencies, are meant for creating the tendency to turn towards the indwelling Self.\n\n [The Vedic injunctions make people up rituals.by giving up their earlier worldly tendencies.\n\n Thery their minds become purified.\n\n The purified mind then aspires to know the indwelling Self.\n\n \n\nThus, since the ritualistic injunctions are meant for making a person turn towards the knowledge ofthe indwelling Self, they are not invalid] Although the means be unreal  \n***(in itself)***\n, still it may be meaningful in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves, as are the eulogistic sentences  \n***(arthavada)***\n [See note on.4.Tr] occuring along with injunctions.\n\n Even in the world, when it becomes necessary to make to child or a lunatic drink milk.it is said that it will help growth of hair [Cuda, lit. hair on the top of the head; or single lock of hair left on the crown of the head after tonsure.\n\n See..].! Before the dawn of Knowledge, the  \n***(ritualistic)***\n Vedic texts concerned with a different situation [The situation obtaining before the dawn of Self-knowledge] are also as valid in themselves as are direct perception.occuring due to Self-identification with the body.On the other hand, as for your view **The Self, though inactive by Itself, acts through Its mere proximity; and that itself constitutes agentship of the Self in the primary sense.\n\n Just as it is well known that a king, though not himself engaged in a battle, is, merely by virtue of his being in charge, said to be fighting when his soldiers are fighting, and that he is victorious or defeated; similarly, as the ?nder of an army acts through his mere orders, and it is seen that the results of the actions accrue to the king or to the ?nder; or, just as the actions of the priests are ascribed to the sacrificer, -in that very manner are the actions done by the body.ought to be of the Self because the result of those actions accrues to the Self.\n\n And, as the agentship of a magnet which, in fact, is not active, is attributed to it in the primary sense because it causes a piece of iron to move, similar is the agentship of the Self**-that is wrong, since it will amunt to an inactive entity becoming an agent.\n\n Objection: May not agentship be of various kinds? Reply: No, for in the case of the **king' and others it is seen that they have agentship even in the primary sense.\n\n As for the king, he fights even through his personal engagement.\n\n And he has agentship in the primary sense by virtue of making  \n***(his)***\n warriors fight, distributing wealth, and also reaping the fruits of victory or defeat.\n\n Similarly, the agentship of a sacrificer is primary by virtue of his offering the main oblation and giving gifts due to the priests.\n\n \n\nTherefore it is understood that the agentship which is attributed to an inactive entity is figurat.\n\n If primary agentship consisting in their personal engagement is not perceived in the case of the king, a sacrificer and others, then it could be assumed that they have primary agentship owing to the mere fact of their presence, just as a magnet has by virtue of making the iron move.\n\n But in the case of the king and others it is not perceived that they have no personal engagement in that way.\n\n \n\nTherefore, even the agentship owing to mere presence is a figurative one.\n\n And if that be so, the connection with the result of such agentship will also be figurat.\n\n No action in the primary sense is performed by an agent figuratively thought to be so.\n\n Hence the assertion is certainly wrong that owing to the activities of the body.the actionless Self becomes an agent and experiencer.\n\n But everything becomes possible due to error.\n\n This is just as it happens in dream or in jugglery! Besides, in deep sleep, absorption in Brahman, where the current of the mistaken idea of Self-identity with the body.ceases, evils like agentship, enjoyership, are not perceived.\n\n \n\nTherefore this delusion of mundane existence is surely due to false knowledge; but it is not reality.\n\n Conseently, it is established that it ceases absolutely as a result of full enlightenment.\n\n Having summed up in this chapter the import of the whole of the scripture Gita, and having again summarized it specially here at the end  \n***(in verse 66)***\n for the sake of emphasizing the purport of the Scripture, now after that, the Lord states the rules for handing down the Scripture:"

Morevoer, if it be that the combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all, then it stands enjoined, ipso facto, on Arjuna as well.\n\n \n\nTherefore, if instruction had been given for practising both, then how could the estion about **either of the two** arise as in, **Tell me for certain one of these  \n***(action and renunciation)***\n by which I may attain the highest Good**  \n***(.2)***\n? Indeed, when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing, there can arise no such reest as, **Tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness**! Again, if it be imagined that Arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the Lord had said, even then the Lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: **The combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by Me.\n\n Why are you confused thus?** On the other hand, it was not proper to have answered, **Two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by Me it the days of yore, ** in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion.\n\n Nor even do all the statements about distinction.become logical if it were intended that Knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the Smrtis only.\n\n Besides, the accusation in the sentence, **Why then do you urge me to horrible action**  \n***(.1)***\n becomes illogical on the part of Arjuna who knew that fighting was a Ksatriya**s natural duty enjoined by the Smrtis.\n\n \n\nTherefore, it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the Gita there is any combination, even in the least, of Knowledge of the Self with rites and duties enjoined by the Srutis or the Smrtis.\n\n But in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment, and then got his mind purified through sacrifices, charities or austerities  \n***(see Br...22)***\n, there arises the knowledge about the supreme Reality that all this is but One, and Brahman is not an agent  \n***(of any action)***\n.\n\n With regard to him, although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them, yet, what may, appear as his diligent continuance, just as before, in those rites and duties for setting an example before people that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with Knowledge.\n\n Just as the actions of Lord Vasudeva, in the form of performance of the duty of a Ksatriya, do not get combined with Knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal  \n***(Liberation)***\n, similar is the case with the man of Knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentshi.\n\n Indeed, a man who has realized the Truth does not thingk **I am doing  \n***(this)***\n** nor does he hanker after its result.\n\n Again, as for instance, person hankering after such desirable things as heaven.may light up a fire for performing such rites as Agnihotra.which are the mans to attain desirable things; [The Ast.\n\n reading is: Agnihotradi-karma-laksana-dharma-anusthanaya, for the performance of duties in the form of acts like Agnihotra.Tr] then, while he is still engaged in the performance of Agnihotra.as the means for the desirable things, the desire may get destroyed when the rite is half-done.\n\n He may nevertheless continue the performance of those very Agnihotra.; but those performance of those very Agnihotra.; but those Agnihotra.cannot be held to be for this personal gain.\n\n Accordingly does the Lord also show in various places that, **even while perfroming actions, ** he does not act, **he does not become tainted**  \n***(.7)***\n.\n\n As for the texts, **৷৷.\n\nas was performed earlier by the ancient ones**  \n***(.15)***\n, **For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself**  \n***(.20)***\n, they are to be understood analytically.\n\n Objection: How so? Vedantin: As to that, if Janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of Reality, they did so for preventing people from going astray, while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that **the organs rest  \n***(act)***\n on the objects of the organs**  \n***(.28)***\n.\n\n The idea is this that, though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise, they remained established in realization along with actions; they did not give up their rites and duties.\n\n On the other hand, if they were not knowers of Reality, then the explanation should be this; Through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to God, Janaka and others remained established in perfection  \n***(samsiddhi)***\n either in the form of purification of mind or rise of Knowledge.\n\n This very idea [The idea that rites and duties become the cause of Knowledge through the purification of the mind] will be expressed by the Lord in, **\n***(the yogis)***\n undertake action for the purification of oneself  \n***(. of the heart, or the mind)***\n**  \n***(.11)***\n.\n\n After having said, **A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties** [By performing one**s own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to God, one**s mind becomes purified.\n\n Then, through Gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in Knowledge.\n\n From that steadfatness follows Liberation.\n\n \n\nTherefore rites and duites do not directly lead to Liberation.\n\n  \n***(See Common.\n\n under.12)***\n  \n***(46)***\n, He will again speak of the steadfastness in Knowledge of a person who has attained success, in the text, **\n***(Understand৷৷.\n\nfrom Me৷৷.\n\nthat process by which)***\n one who has achieved success attains Brahman**  \n***(50)***\n.\n\n So, the definite conclusion in the Gita is that Liberation is attained only from the knowledge of Reality, and not from its combination with action.\n\n And by pointing out in the relevant contexts the  \n***(aforesaid)***\n distinction, we shall show how this conclusion stands.\n\n That being so, Lord Vasudeva found that for Arjuna, whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [The ast.\n\n and.., have an additional word mithyajnanavatah, meaning **who had false ignorance**.Tr] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow, there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the Self.\n\n And desiring to rescue Arjuna from that, He said, **\n***(You grieve for)***\n those who are not to be grieved for, **.by way of introducing the knowledge of the Self.\n\n [In this Gita there are three distinct parts, each part consisting of six chapters.\n\n These three parts deal with the three words of the great Upanisadic saying, **Tattvamasi, thou art That', with a view to finding out their real meanings.\n\n The first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam  \n***(thou)***\n; the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat  \n***(that)***\n; and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat.\n\n The disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places]"

        "explanation": "21 In the mantra, **He who thinks of this One as the killer, ** having declared that  \n***(the Self)***\n does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing, and then in the mantra, **Never is this One born, **.having stated the reasons for  \n***(Its)***\n changelessness, the Lord sums up the purport of what was declared above: He who knows this One as indestructible, Yah, he who; veda, knows yah is to be thus connected with Veda ; enam, this One, possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra; as avinasinam, indestructible, devoid of the final change of state; nityam, eternal, devoid of transformation; ajam, birthless; and avyayam, undecaying; katham, how, in what way;\n***(and kam, whom;)***\n does sah, that man of realization; purusah, the person who is himself an authority [ above all injunctions and prohibitions.\n\n See -Tr]; hanti, kill, undertake the act of killing; or how ghatayati, does he cause  \n***(others)***\n to be killed, \n***(how does he)***\n instigate a killer! The intention is to deny both  \n***(the acts)***\n by saying, **In no way does he kill any one, nor does he cause anyone to be killed**, because an interrogative sense is absurd  \n***(here)***\n.\n\n Since the implication of the reason [The reason for the denial of killing.is the changelessness of the Self, and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization.Tr], viz the immutability of the Self, [The.. omits **viz the immutability of the Self**.Tr] is common  \n***(with regard to all actions)***\n, therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the Lord conveys as the only purport of this context.\n\n But the denial of  \n***(the act of)***\n killing has been cited by way of an example.\n\n Objection: By noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the Lord deny all actions  \n***(in his case)***\n by saying, **How can that person, **.? Vedantin: Has not the immutability of the Self been already stated as the reason [Some readings omit this word.Tr], the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions? Objection: It is true that it has been stated; but that is not a specific ground, for the man of realization is different from the immutable Self.\n\n Indeed, may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?! Vedantin: No, because of man of Knowledge is one with the Self.\n\n Enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses.\n\n \n\nTherefore, as the last laternative, the knower is the Immutable and is the Self which is not a part of the aggregate.\n\n \n\nThus, action being impossible for that man of Knowledge, the denial in, **How can that person৷৷.\n\n, **.is reasonable.\n\n As on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the Self and the modifications of the intellect, the Self, though verily immutable, is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound.presented by the intellect.in this very way, the Self, which in reality is immutable, is said to be the **knower** because of Its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the Self and non-Self, which  \n***(knowledge)***\n is a modification of the intellect [By buddhi-vrtti, modification of the intellect, is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object, along with its past impressions, the senses concerned, like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object.\n\n Consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object, is called objective knowledge.\n\n Thery, due to ignorance, the Self is imagined to be the perceiver because of Its connection with the vrtti, modification.\n\n  \n***(\n\n.)***\n The process is elsewhere described as follows: The vrtti goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness.\n\n Both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance.\n\n The vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot.\n\n In the case of knowledge of Brahman, it is admitted that the vrtti in the form, **I am Brahman**, does reach Brahman and destroys ignorance about Brahman, but it is not admitted that Brahman is revealed like a **pot**, for Brahman is self-effulgent.Tr] and is unreal by nature.\n\n From the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the Lord is that, actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened.\n\n Objection: Is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? For, the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless, like grinding something that has already been ground! This being so, the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened, and not for the enlightened one, does not stand to reason.\n\n Vedantin:.There can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed.\n\n As after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like Agnihotra.their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks, **Agnihotra.has to be performed by collecting various accessories; I am the agent, and this is my duty**, unlike this, nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the Self from such texts as, **Never is this One born, **.But apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the Self, his non-agency, in the form, **I am not the agent, I am not the enjoyer**, no other idea arises.\n\n \n\nThus, this distinction can be maintained.\n\n Again, for anyone who knows himself as, **I am the agent**, there will necessarily arise the idea, **This is my duty.**\n\nIn relation to that he becomes eligible.\n\n In this way duties are  \n***(enjoined)***\n [Ast.\n\n adds **sambhavanti, become possible**.Tr] for him.\n\n And according to the text, **both of them do not know**  \n***(19)***\n, he is an unenlightened man.\n\n And the text, **How can that person, **.concerns the enlightened person distinguished above, becuase of the negation of action  \n***(in this text)***\n.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the enlightened person distinguished above, who has realized the immutable Self, and the seeker of Liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties.\n\n \n\nTherefore, indeed, the Lord Narayana, making a distinction between the enlightened man of Knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties, makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text, **through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis**  \n***(.3)***\n.\n\n Similarly also, Vyasa said to his son, **\n\nNow, there are these two paths, **.[**\n\nNow, there are these two paths on which the Vedas are based.\n\n They are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties, and that by renunciation of them**  \n***(Mbh.\n\n Sa. 24.\n\n6)***\n.Tr] So also  \n***(there is a Vedic text meaning)***\n: **The path of rites and duties, indeed, is the earlier, and renunciation comes after that.**\n\n[Ast.\n\n says that this is not a otation, but only gives the purport of Tai, Ar.\n\n 6.Tr] The Lord will show again and again this very division: **The unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus:  \n\u003e I am the doer\n; but the one who is a knower of the facts  \n***(about the varieties of the gunas)***\n thinks, \n\u003e I do not act\n**  \n***(cf.\n\n.27, 28)***\n.\n\n So also there is the text, **\n***(The embodied man of selfcontrol, )***\n having given up all actions mentally, continues  \n***(happily in the town of nine gates)***\n**  \n***(.13)***\n.With regard to this some wiseacres say: In no person does arise the idea, **I am the changeless, actionless Self, which is One and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject**, on the occurrence of which  \n***(idea alone)***\n can renunciation of all actions be enjoined.\n\n That is not correct, because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as, **Never is this One born, **.\n***(20)***\n.\n\n They should be asked: As on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies, similarly, why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability, non-agentship, oneness, of that very Self? Objection: If it be said that this is due to Its being beyond the scope of any means  \n***(of knowledge)***\n? Vedantin: No, because the Sruti says, **It is to be realized through the mind alone, \n***(following the instruction of the teacher)***\n**  \n***(Br...19)***\n.\n\n The mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher, control of the body and organs, becomes the instrument for realizing the Self.\n\n Again, since there exist inference and scriptures for Its realization, it is mere bravado to say that Knowledge does not ar.\n\n And it has to be granted that when knowledge arises, it surely eliminates ignorance, its oppos.\n\n And that ignorance has been shown in, **I am the killer**, **I am killed**, and **both of them do not know**  \n***(see.19)***\n.\n\n And here also it is shown that the idea of the Self being an agent, the object of an action, or an indirect agent, is the result of ignorance.\n\n Also, the Self being changeless, the fact that such agentship.are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception, because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on, saying, **Do this.**\n\n\n\nThus, with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person, the Lord [Ast, adds vasudeva after **Lord**.Tr] says, **He who knows this One as indestructible, ** **how can that person, **.thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception.\n\n As regards the estion, **For what, again, is the man of enlightenment alified?**, the answer has already been give earlier in, **through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization**  \n***(.3)***\n.\n\n Similarly, the Lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in, **having given up all actions mentally, **.\n***(.13)***\n.\n\n Objection: May it not be argued that from the expression, **mentally**, \n***(it follows that)***\n oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced? Vedantin: No, because of the categoric expression, **all actions**.\n\n Objection: May it not be argued that **all actions** relates only to those of the mind? Vedantin: No, because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind, for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity.\n\n Objection: May it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body? Vedantin: No, because it has been specifically expressed: **without doing or causing  \n***(others)***\n to do anything at all**  \n***(.13)***\n.\n\n Objection: May it not be that this renunciation of all actions, as stated by the Lord, is with regard to a dying man, not one living? Vedantin: No, because  \n***(in that case)***\n the specific statement, **The embodied man৷৷.\n\ncontinues happily in the town of nine gates**  \n***(ibid.)***\n will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person, who neither acts nor makes others act, [The words **akurvatah akarayatah, \n***(of him)***\n who neither acts nor makes others act**, have been taken as a part of the Commentator**s arguement.\n\n But.. points out that they can also form a part of the next Objection.\n\n In that, case, the translation of the Objection will be this: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence  \n***(under discussion)***\n is Neither doing nor making others do, he rest by depositing  \n***(sannyasya, by renouncing)***\n in the body**, but not **he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.\n\n**?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions.\n\n Objection: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence  \n***(under discussion)***\n is, **\n***(he rests)***\n by depositing  \n***(sannyasya, by renouncing)***\n in the body**, \n***(but)***\n not **he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.\n\n**? Vedantin: No, because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the Self is changeless.\n\n Besides, the action of **resting** reires a location, whereas renunciation is independent of this.\n\n The word nyasa preceded by sam here means **renunciation**, not **depositing**.\n\n \n\nTherefore, according to this Scripture, viz the Gita, the man of realization is eligible for renunciation, alone, not for rites and duties.\n\n This we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the Self.\n\n And now we shall speak of the matter on hand: As to that, the indestructibility [Indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well] of the Self, has been postulated.\n\n What is it like? That is being said in, **As after rejecting wornout clothes, **."

The answer is: Because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action.\n\n Indeed, there can be no attainment of an end without  \n***(its)***\n means.\n\n And Karma-yoga is the means to the Yoga of Knowledge characterized by freedom from action, because it has been so established in the Upanisads and here as well.\n\n As for the Upanisads, it has been shown in the texts, **The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, \n***(charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects)***\n**  \n***(Br...22)***\n, whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of Knowledge under discussion, viz the Realm of the Self, that the Yoga of Karma is a means to the Yoga of Knowledge.And even here  \n***(in the Gita)***\n, the Lord will established that, **But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without  \n***(Karma-)***\nyoga**  \n***(.6)***\n; **By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work৷৷.\n\nfor the purification of themselves**  \n***(.11)***\n; **Sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise**  \n***(5)***\n, Objection: Is it not that in such texts as-**Extending to all creatures immunity from fear**  \n***(Na.\n\n Par.\n\n.43)***\n, \n***(one should take recourse to freedom from action)***\n- it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties? And in the world, too, it is a better known fact that freedom from action follows abstention from actions.\n\n Hence also arises the estion, **Why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action?' Reply: \n\nTherefore the Lord said: Na ca, nor; samadhi-gacchati, does he attain; siddhim, fulfilment steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, characterized by freedom from action; sannyasanat eva, merely through renunciation-even from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of Knowledge.\n\n What, again, is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with Knowledge, a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions? To this ery seeking to know the cause, the Lord says:"

For action cannot become inaction, nor inaction action.\n\n That being so, how can a witness have  \n***(such)***\n an incongruous perception? Vedantin: Is it not that [Ast.\n\n reads na in place of nanu.Tr] to an ordinary foolsih observer, that which is reality is inaction appears as action, and similarly, action itself as inaction? That being so, in order to show things as they are the Lord says, **He who finds inaction in action**, \n\nTherefore there is no incongruity.\n\n Besides, the alifications such as **intelligent**.\n***(thus)***\n become logic.\n\n And by saying, **there is something to be known**, is implied the perception of things as they are.\n\n Moreover, freedom from evil cannot follow from an erroneous perception; whereas it has been said, **by knowing which you will become free from evil**.\n\n \n\nTherefore, one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures, the Lord**s utterance, **he who finds inaction in action, **.is for dispelling their contrary perception.\n\n Not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle, like a plum in a bowl! Nor even has action inaction as its receptacle, because inaction is a negation of action.\n\n \n\nTherefore, action and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons-like seeing water in a mirage, or silver in nacre.\n\n Objection: Is it not that to every one action is action itself? Never is there an exception to this.\n\n Vedantin: That is not so, becuase when a boat is moving, motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat; an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near one**s eyes.\n\n Similarly, here also occurs the contrary perceptions, viz seeing action in inaction under the idea, **I am doing**, [Ast.\n\n omits **aham karomi iti, under the idea, \n\u003e I am doing\n**.Tr] and seeing, inaction in acion, -because of which it is said, **He who finds inaction in action, **.in order to eliminate them.\n\n As such, although this answer has been given more than once, still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of a totally opposite perception.\n\n And forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again, he repeatedly raises false issues and estions! And therefore, observing that the subject is difficult to understand, the Lord gives His answer again and again.\n\n The absence of action in the Self-well-known from the Vedas, Smrtis and logic, as stated in, **\n***(It is said that)***\n This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable**  \n***(.25)***\n, **Never is this One born, and never does It die**  \n***(.20; Ka.\n\n..18)***\n,has been and will be spoken of.\n\n The contrary perception of action in that actionless Self, in inaction, is very deep-rooted, owing to which **even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction.**\n\nAnd as a conseence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body.on the Self, there arises such ideas as, **I am an agent; this is my action; its result is to be enjoyed by me.**\n\nSimilarly, with the idea, **I shall remain iet, whery I shall be free from exertion, free from activity, and happy**, and superimposing on the Self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness, a man imagines, **I shall not do anything; I shall sit ietly and happily.**\n\nThat being so, the Lord says, **he who finds inaction in action, **.with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man.\n\n And here in this world, though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action, still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless, unchanging Self, as a result of which even a learned person things, **I act.**\n\n\n\nTherefore, in action  \n***(karmani)***\n, which is universally considered by all people to be inherent in the Self, like the perception of motion in the  \n***(stationary)***\n trees on the bank of a river-\n***(in that action)***\n he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction, like perceiving absence of motion in those trees-\n\n And, in inaction  \n***(akarmani)***\n in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the Self in the same way that actions are ascribed- in that action, he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea, **I am happily seated ietly, without doing anything**- \n\n he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction, is wise, is learned among men; he is engaged in yoga, he is a yogi, and a performer of all actions.\n\n And he, freed from evil, attains fulfilment.\n\n This is the meaning.\n\n This verse is interpreted by some in another way.\n\n How?  \n***(\n\nThus:)***\n **Since the daily obligatory duties  \n***(nityakarmas)***\n certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to God, therefore, in a secondary sense, they are said to be inaction.\n\n Again, the non-performance of these  \n***(nitya-karmas)***\n is inaction; since this produces an evil result, therefore it is called action, verily in a figurative sense.\n\n That being so, he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties  \n***(nitya-karmas)***\n owing to the obsence of their results-in the same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow, though in reality it is so-so also, in the non-performance of the daily obligatory duties, in inaction, he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc৷৷.**\n\nThis explanation is not logical, because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable, and the utterance of the Lord in the sentence, **৷৷.\n\nby knowing which you will become freed from evil**, will be contradicted.\n\n How? Even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nitya-karmas, it cannot, however, follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results.\n\n For it has not been enjoined  \n***(anywhere)***\n that knowledge of the nityakarmas  \n***(themselves)***\n, leads to the result of freedom from evil.\n\n Nor has this been stated here by the Lord Himself.\n\n Hery is refuted the **seeing of action in inaction** [As explained by others.Tr], for  \n***(according to the opponent)***\n **seeing of action in inaction** has not been enjoined here [Here, in the present verse] as a duty, but  \n***(what has been enjoined is)***\n merely that performance of the nityakarmas is obligatory.\n\n Moreover, no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from non-performance of nityakramas.\n\n Nor even has non-performance of nityakarmas.\n\n been enjoined as something that should be known.\n\n Besides, such results as freedom from evil, wisdom, engagement in yoga, and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction.\n\n Nor is this a eulogy of false perception.\n\n [The stated results accrue from correct knowledge, not from false perception; and correct knowledge alone is praise-worthy] Indeed, false perception is itself an abvious form of evil! How can it bring about liberation from another evil? Surely, darkness does not become the remover of darkness! Opponent: Well, the seeing of inaction in action, or the seeing of action in inaction-that is not a false perception.\n\n Vadantin: What then? Opponent: It is a figurative statement based on the existence or the non-existence of results.\n\n Vedantin: Not so, because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action, even in a figurative sense.\n\n Besides, nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of  \n***(in the scriptures)***\n and imagining something that is not.\n\n Further, it was possible  \n***(for the Lord)***\n to express in His own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas, and that by their non-performance one would have to go to hell.\n\n Under such circumstances, what was the need of the ambiguous statement, **He who sees inaction in action, **.which is misleading to others? This being the case, such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the Lord as meant for deluding people.\n\n Moreover, this subject-matter  \n***(performance of nityakarmas)***\n is not something to be protected with mystifying words.\n\n It is not even logical to say that the subject-matter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words.\n\n For, the subject-matter that was stated more clearly in, **Your right is for action alone**  \n***(.47)***\n, does not need any repetition.\n\n And everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be understood; anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known.\n\n Besides, neither is false knowledge worth aciring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing.\n\n Nor even can any evil, which is an entity, arise from the non-performance of nityakarmas, which is a non-entity, for there is the statement, **Of the unreal there is no being**  \n***(.16)***\n, and  \n***(in the Upanisad)***\n it has been pointed out, **How can existence originate from nonexistence?**  \n***(...2)***\n.\n\n Since emergence of the existent from the nonexistent has been denied, therefore anyone**s assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! And that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge.\n\n Further, the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions, they being naturally painful; and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally.\n\n Also, if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their non-performance  \n***(. of the nityakarmas)***\n, then that too is surely a source of evil.\n\n In either case, whether one undertakes them or not, the scriptures will be imagined to be useless.\n\n And there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when, after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless, you assert that they lead to Liberation.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the meaning of **He who finds inaction in action, **.is just what stands out literally.\n\n And the verse has been explained by us accordingly.\n\n The aforesaid perception of **inaction in action, is being praised:"

that also is brahma eva, surely Brahman.\n\n Brahma-karma-samadhina, by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective: Brahman Itself is the objective  \n***(karma)***\n; he who has concentration  \n***(samadhi)***\n on That is brahma-karma-samdhih.\n\n The goal to be reached by him is Brahman alone.\n\n \n\nThus, even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction, for it has been sublated by the realization of Brahman.\n\n This being so, in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off, who has renounced all activity, viewing his Knowledge as a  \n***(kind of)***\n sacrifice, too, becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization.\n\n That is, whatever is well known as ladle.in the context of a sacrifice, all that, in the context of the Self, is Brahman Itself to one who has realized the supreme Truth.\n\n If not so, then, since all in Brahman, it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle.as Brahman.\n\n \n\nTherefore, all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that Brahman Itself is all this.\n\n And this follows also from the absence  \n***(in him)***\n of the idea of accessories.\n\n [See note on.2-Tr] For the act called **sacarifice** is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories.\n\n All such acts as Agnihotra.are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering.to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures, and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results.\n\n But they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action, accessories and results, or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results.\n\n This  \n***(apparent)***\n  \n***(activity of the man of Knowledge)***\n, however, stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle.actions and results, which get destroyed by the Knowledge of Brahman.\n\n Hence, it is inaction to be sure.\n\n And thus has it been shown in, **He who finds inaction in action**  \n***(18)***\n, **he really does not do anything even though engaged in action**  \n***(20)***\n, **the organs act on the objects of the organs**  \n***(.28)***\n, **Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, \n\u003e I certainly do not do anything\n**  \n***(.8)***\n, While pointing out thus, the Lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions, accessories and results.\n\n And it is also seen in the case of rites such as Agnihotra undertaken for results  \n***(kamya)***\n, that the Agnihotra.cease to be  \n***(kamya)***\n rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed.\n\n Similarly, it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results.\n\n So, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle.actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman, even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction.\n\n Hence it was said, **gets totally destroyed.**\n\nHere some say: That which is Brahman is the ladle.It is surely Brahman Itself which exists in the five forms [Asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical case-ending, viz Nominative, Objective, Instrumental, Dative and Locat.\n\n  \n***(As for instance, the sacrificer, oblation, ladle, sacrificial fire, and Brahman.Tr.)***\n of accessories such as the ladle.and it is Itself which undertakes actions.\n\n There the ideas of ladle.are not eradicated, but the idea of Brahman is attributed to the ladle.as one does the ideas of Visnu.to images.or as one does the idea of Brahman ot name.Reply: True, this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna  \n***(Knowledge considered as a sacrifice)***\n.\n\n Here, however, after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana-yajna, and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna  \n***(sacrifice)***\n, Knowledge has been praised by the Lord in, **Jnana-yajna  \n***(Knowledge considered as a sacrifice)***\n is greater than sacrifices reiring materials**  \n***(33)***\n.\n\n And in the present context, this statement, **the ladle is Brahman**.is capable of presenting Knowledge as a sacrifice; otherwise, since Brahman is everything, it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle.as Brahman.\n\n But those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle.like superimposing the idea of Visnu and others on images.and of Brahman on name.for them the knowledge of Brahma stated  \n***(in the verse)***\n cannot be the intended subject-matter dealt with here, because according to them ladle.are the  \n***(primary)***\n objects of knowledge  \n***(in the context of the present verse)***\n.\n\n Besides, knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to Liberation as its result; and what is said here is, **Brahman alone in to be realized by him**.\n\n Also, it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of Liberation can be achieved without full realization.\n\n And it goes against the context-the context being of full realization.\n\n This is supported by the fact that  \n***(the subject of )***\n full realization is introduced in the verse, **He who finds inaction in action, ** and at the end  \n***(of this chapter)***\n the conclusion pertains to that very subject-matter.\n\n The chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in, **Jnana-yajna  \n***(Knowledge considered as a sacrifice)***\n is greater than sacrifices reiring materials**, **Achieving Knowledge, one৷৷.\n\nattains supreme Peace, **  \n***(39)***\n.That being so, it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle.like the superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images.\n\n \n\nTherefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained.\n\n As to that, after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in, the verses beginning with, **\n***(Other yogis undertake)***\n sacrifice to gods alone, **.for eulogizing that Knowledge:"
