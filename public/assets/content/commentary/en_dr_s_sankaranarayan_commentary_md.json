With this idea only, it has been said in the Adiparvan as - **The austerity is not dirt, nor the [Vedic] study, nor the natural ritual enjoined by the Vedas, and nor the act of earning wealth by all efforts.\n\n But, if they are struck by mind, they themselves become dirt.**\n\n \n***(MB, Adi.\n\n i, 210)***\n.\n\n [Here in this passage] dirt that which fetters.\n\n Natural : [That is, ordained ], such as - **Without expecting anything, a Brahman should learn the Vedas , together with their six subsidiaries** . By all effort : by the act that is suitable and is well known in the scriptures and in the worldly pract.\n\n By mind : by the mind that is yoked to the traid of the Strands, Sattva . [Those actions that] have been simply ruined [by that mind], are binding and not otherw.\n\n This is the idea here.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the acts like sacrifice , and the acts, like aciring [Wealth] , for that purpose, have to be perfored as being inevitable as long as the body exists.\n\n Or, perhaps, the word OM conveys [with regard to the Brahman] the idea of That in Which the entire universe has been totally calmed down.\n\n TAT conveys the idea of That of the nature of Sovereign Independence of Will, which is nothing but comprehending the rising waves in the form of the universe.\n\n And the word SAT denotes the act of manifestation by the Brahman - even though It is complete in Itself - as [the universe] having varied nature, a manifestation that causes differences  \n***(or duality)***\n expanding under the weight of its Sovereign Independenc of Will.\n\n Hence it has been said **In the sense of manifesting as beings and in the sense of manifesting perfectly [SAT is employed].**\n\n\n\nThus, having is front [as a casue] that aspect  \n***(the Soul)***\n of highly tranil nature; and having in the centre that aspect which is well connected with desire-waves , the desire to make gift, the desire to perform sacrifice and the desire to observe penance; this final body radiates  \n***(or dances)***\n filled with a group of activities, such as offering gift, performing sacrifice and observing austerity, and of what are conducive to them.\n\n This triad is indeed simultaneously the inherent nature of the Unhindered One  \n***(the Soul)***\n.\n\n So, what fruit could be there ? And to whom ? How ? Whence ? Where ? And by what means ? The act of person, with no faith, is an act of the Tamas and bears no fruit in any way and bears fruit which is nothing but the labour undertaken in bringing together the band of means [of those acts].\n\n Hence one should not on any account remain faithless.\n\n This is being said now :"

It is wrong to say that is the same as gaining the self by what is non-existent.\n\n For, to be of the nature of non-existence, is indeed to be devoid of every inherent nature and to be devoid of the very self.\n\n If a thing is devoid of the self and devoid of every nature, how is it possible to convert it into what has an intrinsic nature ?

For, what has gained a self, could never be non-existent and conseently it would be etern.\n\n Likewise, is the act of **going** also meant for the existent or the non-existent ?

Yet, if that destruction is altogether different [from the existent one . the pot], then what does it matter for what is existent ? But, it is not be seen [at that time] ?

Hence [to achieve this result the Lord] teaches also the means or device by **\n\nTherefore** : The Bhagavat surely, on His own accord, becomes [even at the time of death] the object of memory of that person from whose heart  \n***(mind)***\n the Bhagavat has never gone away in any cirucumstance connected with the mundane life also; who has [thus] renounced all his actions to the Bhagavat alone; and who is full of  \n***(fully absorbed in)***\n the Bhagavat.\n\n For this end, the means is to remain constantly absorbed in the thought of the Bhagavat.\n\n That is why He Says : **With whatever object the internal organ of a person is filled up always, that object alone is remembered by him at the time of death, and the state of that being alone is attained [by him].\n\n Hence, let a person, by all means, have Me alone as his goal and be desirous of attaining Me**.\n\n This is the idea here.\n\n The idea [intended here] is certainly not **What is remembered, without fail, at the last moment that being alone is attained by him**.\n\n Because in that case the attainment of the man of wisdom would also be just like that of an ignorant man.\n\n For, the former too [at the time of death] gets [complete] dulness of mind that is benumbed by the disorder  \n***(or defect)***\n of he elements existing in his entire body.\n\n Certainly it is not proper to accept this here.\n\n For, it would go agains the authority of the scriptures.\n\n For, the fact is- **He who has attained liberation simultaneously with realisation [of the Self], and whose sorrows [therefore] have been destroyed - he attains completely unity [with the Absolute] even though [at the time of death] he has lost his memory and abandons his body in a sacred place or in the house of a dog-cooker  \n***( man of a low tribe)***\n**.\n\n  \n***(PS, 83)***\n.\n\n \n\nTherefore the matter-of-fact statement  \n***(or explanation)***\n and injunction [that are meant here] are the following : If a person**s internal organ is absorbed incessantly in the thought of a particular being, the same being is attained by him at end after departure.\n\n It is immaterial whether [at the time of departure] that being is remembered or not.\n\n This secondary importance [of the remembrance] is indicated by the word api **also**.\n\n The word va **or** makes it clear that the rememberance does not exist in each and every case.\n\n The Sage  \n***(Vyasa)***\n himself clarifies his idea **Let a man always remain by all means keeping Me  \n***(the Absolute Lord)***\n as his supreme goal**.\n\n Since the Sage says : **\n\nTherefore at all times keep Me  \n***(the Absolute)***\n in your mind**.\n\n \n\nTherefore, the following is the combination of words [of the verse intended here] : If a person, remembering always, or at the last moment - the use of or denotes **or not remembering [at the last moment]** - a particular being, leaves his body, he attains that particular being alone.\n\n For, he is always absorbed in the thought of that being.\n\n But others [interpret the verses as follows] : When one leaves his body as the end, just at the moment of leaving the body , at that moment which is not cognizable to the perceivers like relatives, sons . [standing nearby]; at that moment that comes last after the limb-movements, like [heavy] breathing, exertion, hiccup, convulsive utterance , [have endred]; at that fraction of time when the bondage of pleasure, pain and bewilderment is weakened as a result of the weakening of the control of the bodily strength; at that time that goes by the term dehatyajana **the moment of casting the body off**; at that moment whatsoever being a person remembers, his nature becomes entriely identical with that being, favoured  \n***(taken as an object)***\n by the First Consiousness.\n\n the cause for remembering [the Lord] at that moment is to remanin ever absorbed in the thought of Him.\n\n The word tyajati [of verse 6] is to be construed as the seventh case [meaning **at the time of abandoning**].\n\n Hence, the purport [of the passage] is only what has been said above.\n\n What is the use of such a remembrance of Him at the last moment ? But, who told that [there] is a use [for it] ? But, the remembrance is certainly brought about as a natural course at the last moment.\n\n But this [proposition] would lead to an undersirable conseence.\n\n For, it has been observed that a person [usually] remberances at the last moment either the maintenance of his children, wife and relatives, or drinking of cold water and so on.\n\n So, he would become identical with those things.\n\n It is not so.\n\n The moment, you speak of, is not the last moment.\n\n For, at that moment the existence of body is being clearly felt.\n\n Really that last moment, which we would like to speak of, can**t be perceived by persons like you.\n\n In what form alone the remembrance should be there at the last moment is decided by [its cause], a potential mental impression certainly arising at that time - even though it is far off - according to the general principle : **The remembrance and the potential mental impression [that causes it] being identical in form, there should be a seential immediacy [between them], even though they are removed [from one another] by many births, by long distance and by long passage of time**.\n\n  \n***(YS, IV, 9)***\n.\n\n \n\nThus, depending on the potential mental impression, there arises remembrance of a particular being, and becuase of its remembrance one attains the identity of that being.\n\n \n\nHowever in the case of certain body the same [process] is accidentally indicated even at the stage of healthy body-condition.\n\n See for example, the remembrance of a deer , [both in the healthy conditions and in the dying moment] and the conseential attainment of the deerhood, as described in the Puranic literature.\n\n That is why api ca **and also** is employed in [the statement] like **and also at the time of journey.**\n\n\n\nTherefore, those who constantly think of the Bhagavat with intention **Let us become this Being**; they attain [in the following order] the identity with Absolute Lord, of the exclusive nature of Consciousness : [First] there arises the thought  \n***(smarana)***\n of the Lord at the moment when the bodily existence is felt; then at that unperceivable last moment the potential mental impression, born of the said thought, gives rise to the remembrance of the Lord by striking down all the other potential mental impressions, according to the principle : **The potential mental impression, born therefrom , make all other potential mental impressions powerless  \n***(Y.\n\n, I, 50)***\n.\n\n Then only at the moment of the fall of the body, because at that time the mental impression created by [the sense of] time has come to an end and because the differences of the objects like **this**, **that' , are not felt-at that moment he attains identity with the Lord.\n\n This much of discussion is enough.\n\n Without doubt  \n***(verse 7)***\n : one should not entertain any doubt in this regard."

Why ? By being votaries of gods, they attain the gods .  \n***(verse 26)***\n.\n\n It amounts to say that this [fact of attaining these gods] is itself nothing but moving away [from Me, the Self].\n\n On the other hand, those who realise My nature  \n***(. Me)***\n as being not different [from their Self], they offer sacrifices to Me alone, even though those sacrifices . are for the gods, goblins and manes.**\n\n[The Lord] is going to conclude [the present topic] as : **\n***(\n\nThus)***\n offering sacrifice to Me they attain Me alone.**\n\n \n***(IX-29, 35)***\n.\n\n But that alone is called a deity which is aimed at [according to injunction], for offering things  \n***(. oblation)***\n.\n\n Hence, how can a sacrifice be offered to one**s own Self, a category that cannot be aimed at ? \n\nFor example, there is the injunction: **The oblation [of rice] of the rite prayana, crooked in the milk, is intended for the deity Aditi**; and hence this Aditi becomes the object intended [in the sacrifice], because that particular deity is an adjunct of an injunction, and because it is included in the injunction as one to be aimed at.\n\n But [in the present case], there is no injunction that concerns the Self.\n\n Having [these objections] in mind [the Lord] says : [They offer sacrifice] to Me following non-injunction.\n\n The idea is this : An injunction is reired only in the case of a deity that is different from one**s own Self.\n\n For, the injunction is one of the nature of imparting the knowledge only of that particular thing which is not known [otherwise].\n\n But, one**s own Self, the Absolute Lord, is known, not following any injunction.\n\n For, the knowledge of the Self is not brought by injunction.\n\n Certainly no action is undertaken not aiming the Self.\n\n \n\nTherefore in all cases [of offerings], intended for the deities like Indra , this Self of one**s own is certainly intended , as the Self is, by nature, the illuminator of the entire Universe; as It is like a thread in a garland; and as It is illumining [on Its own accord], asserting Its superiority [over all others] and only serving as a background  \n***(bhittih, **a screen**, or **a wall**)***\n of the manifestations of the deity so intended by him [in the sacrifice].\n\n \n\nThus it is established by logic that even the votaries of gods offer sacrifices to Me  \n***(the Absolute)***\n alone, becuase **I** depends on no injunction.\n\n As far as these sacrificers are concerned, the principal effect of the sacrifice , attaining **Me**, is not intended by them as their own.\n\n On the other hand, they are very much satisfied with attaining the status of Indra , just as a priest is satisfied with limited fees.\n\n To indicate this, the parasmaipada form  \n***(yajanti)***\n [is used].\n\n For, it has been stated by myself  \n***(Ag.)***\n [else-where] as : **One, who knows the Vedas and does not know [to intend for] the status of  \n***(or the word)***\n Sambhu  \n***(the Absolute)***\n, would feel afflicted in despair.\n\n [For], aspiring for the heaven, and [hence] rejecting the status of [the actual] performer of of sacrifice  \n***(yajamana)***\n, [but at the same time] performing sacrifice for others  \n***(yajan)***\n, he has become a [mere] priest in the sacrif.\n\n Indeed, the divergently flowing floods of taste for action, without exception, - even though they flow from the Absolute consciousness - do not bestow [on the performer] the mighty ocean of Bliss of one**s own Self if they do not gain a complete stability' \n\nThus whosoever realises in the said manner, his sacrifice, though aimed at the deities like Indra, is in fact a sacrifice offered to the Absolute Lord.\n\n Whatever may be the other actions of his, they too become acts of worshipping his own Self, the Absolute Lord, as It alone is intended in all his action.\n\n This [the Lord] says :"
