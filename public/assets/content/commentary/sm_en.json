    "explanation": "**The Dilemma of King Dhritarashtra**\n\n### Verse Explanation: The King's Concerns\n\n1.1 The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu's sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question?\n\n#### The Blind King's Confusion\n\nThe blind King Dhritarashtra's fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.\n\n#### The Conflict Within Dhritarashtra\n\nThe words \"dharma\" and \"kurukṣhetra\" used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing. Kurukshetra is described as \"kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam\" in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means \"Kurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.\" Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma.\n\n#### Dhritarashtra's Fears\n\nDhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them.\n\n#### The King's Uncertainty\n\nHe felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires. He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n* King Dhritarashtra's concerns about his sons' actions on the battlefield\n* The conflict within Dhritarashtra due to his fondness for his sons and past injustices\n* The significance of Kurukshetra as a sacred land that nourishes dharma"

    "explanation": "**The Story of Duryodhana's Concerns**\n\n### Background Information\n\n1.2 Sanjay understood Dhritarashtra’s concern, who wanted an assurance that the battle would eventuate. Sanjay tried to allay his worry by informing that the Pandava army was standing in a military formation, ready for battle. Then he moved on to tell him what his son Duryodhana was doing on the battlefield.\n\n### The Personality of Duryodhana\n\nAs King Dhritarashtra was blind, his eldest son **Duryodhana** virtually ruled the kingdom of Hastinapur. In the Mahabharata, he is described as very **rude**, **egoistic**, **evil** and **cruel** by nature. Since his childhood, he had a strong dislike for the Pandavas and left no opportunity to demean them. He was aware that to rule over the entire kingdom of Hastinapur unchallenged he needed to eliminate them. However, standing on the battlefield, when he saw the large Pandava army, he was **baffled**. He had underestimated the Pandavas, the extent of military might they had gathered was way beyond his expectation.\n\n### Duryodhana's Approach to His Guru\n\nDuryodhana approached his guru **Dronacharya** with the pretense of offering respect, but his actual purpose was to palliate his own **nervousness**. His move towards his guru also reveals that the mammoth military formation of the Pandava army unnerved him and he was now fearful of the outcome of this war.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe next nine verses are spoken by **Duryodhana**."

    "explanation": "**The Unsettling Reminder**\n================================\n\nDuryodhana, the prince of Kauravas, requested his teacher, Dronacharya, to observe the military phalanx of the Pandava army. The leader of this army was Dhristadyumna, son of King Dhrupad.\n\n**A Past Mistake**\n-----------------\n\nMany years ago, Dronacharya had defeated King Drupad in a battle and taken away half of his kingdom. To avenge this defeat, King Drupad performed a sacrifice to obtain a son. Dhristadyumna was born out of the sacrificial fire, with a boon that he would kill Dronacharya in the future.\n\n**The Boon and Its Consequences**\n---------------------------------\n\nAlthough Dronacharya was aware of the boon, he humbly accepted Dhristadyumna as his pupil and imparted all of his knowledge impartially. Duryodhana reminded his teacher that Dhristadyumna was not only his pupil but also the son of King Drupad, with a promise to kill him in the future.\n\n**The Reminder's Purpose**\n-------------------------\n\nDuryodhana was subtly reminding Dronacharya of a past mistake to ensure that his teacher did not become lenient towards his pupils, especially in the heat of battle. He aimed to recreate the same circumstances that led to Dhristadyumna's birth, with a similar outcome."

Apart from being an exceptional warrior, he had an extraordinary boon. He could choose the time of his death, which meant he was practically invincible.\n\n### The Unbeatable Army and the Egoistic Rivalry\n---------------------------------------------\n\nDuryodhana felt that under Bheeshma's command, their army was undefeatable. On the other hand, the Pandava army was secured by Duryodhana's sworn enemy, Bheema. Hence, he started comparing his Grandfather Bheeshma's strength with his cousin Bheema.\n\n### The Tragic Irony of Fate\n---------------------------\n\n**\"Vinaash kale vipreet buddhi\"** \nas the proverb goes, which means that when the end draws near, egoistic people indulge in vainglory instead of being humble in evaluating their situation. This tragic irony of fate is reflected here in Duryodhana's self-aggrandizing statement that; their army's strength secured by Bheeshma was unlimited.\n\n### A Grandfather's Concerns\n---------------------------\n\nHowever, both Kauravas and Pandavas were Bheeshma's grandchildren and as the oldest living member of the Kuru family, he was concerned about their welfare. He was compassionate towards the Pandavas, but was bound by his ethical commitment towards the throne of Hastinapur and its subjects. Therefore, halfheartedly, he led the Kaurava army against them.\n\n### The Presence of Lord Krishna\n-------------------------------\n\nBheeshma was also aware that in this holy war, along with all the great warriors of the world, the Supreme Lord Krishna Himself was present. Lord Krishna was with the Pandavas, which meant \n**Dharma**\nwas on their side, and no power in the entire universe could make the side of \n**Adharma**\nwin.\n\n### The Unwavering Commitment\n------------------------------\n\nHe had vowed to protect the kingdom of Hastinapur and its subjects and to fulfill his responsibility towards them. Bheeshma led the Kaurava army, even though he was aware of their wrongdoings. This decision of Bheeshma accentuates his strength of character and enigmatic personality.\n\n**The Strength of Character**\n---------------------------\n\nIn the end, it was Bheeshma's unwavering commitment and strength of character that made him a true leader. His decision to lead the Kaurava army, despite being aware of their wrongdoings, showcases his ability to balance his personal feelings with his duty towards the kingdom and its subjects.\n\n**The Enigmatic Personality**\n---------------------------\n\nBheeshma's enigmatic personality is a testament to his exceptional character. He was a leader who could make difficult decisions, prioritize his duty over personal feelings, and maintain a sense of objectivity amidst chaos.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nGrandsire Bheeshma's story serves as a reminder of the importance of strength of character, compassion, and commitment. His leadership in the Kaurava army is a testament to his exceptional qualities as a leader and a person."

    "explanation": "**The Bhagavad Gita Verse: A Deliberate Attempt to Mislead Arjun**\n==================================================================\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a pivotal chapter in the epic Mahabharata, and it revolves around the conversation between Lord Krishna and Prince Arjun. In this chapter, Krishna employs a deliberate strategy to mislead Arjun.\n\n**Krishna's Address to Arjun**\n-------------------------\n\n1.25 Shree Krishna called Arjun “Parth, son of Pritha, another name for his mother Kunti.” Then he pointed at all the warriors like Bhishma, Drona and other kings on the Kaurava side and deliberately used the word “Kuru” to address them.\n\n**The Motive Behind Krishna's Actions**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIt was to remind Arjun that both Kauravas and Pandavas were all descendants of the great king Kuru. Therefore, the enemy he was so eager to kill was actually his own family and relatives.\n\n**The Seed of Delusion**\n------------------------\n\nThe Omniscient Lord was sowing the seed of delusion in Arjun’s mind, only to eliminate it later. He was preparing the ground for the gospel he was about to preach - The Bhagavad Geeta, which would benefit the future generations in the age of Kali.\n\n**The Significance of the Bhagavad Gita**\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis conversation between Krishna and Arjun marks the beginning of a profound spiritual journey. The Bhagavad Gita contains valuable teachings that transcend time and generations, offering insights into the nature of reality, duty, and selfless action. Its message continues to inspire and guide individuals towards a path of wisdom and spiritual growth."

The brave warrior who wanted to punish the Kauravas for all their wickedness a few minutes back suddenly became fearful.\n\n### The Devastating Reality\n\nComprehending the devastation this war would cause, his valor started to diminish.

He was filled with remorse and fearful of performing his duty of fighting this war. The cause for these sentiments was his attachment towards his bodily relatives. He became forgetful of his spiritual existence, that he was not just the body. His affection for his bodily relatives had blinded his consciousness.\n\n### Materialism and Attachment\n------------------------------\n\nIn the materialistic concept, we consider ourselves to be only the body, which is emotionally attached to all its bodily relatives. As this attachment is based on ignorance it carries with it the physical burdens of life like pain, sorrow, grief, and death.\n\n### The True Reality\n-------------------\n\nOnly the death of the physical body can end these materialistic attachments. We are more than just the physical body; our eternal souls are beyond life and death.\n\n### The Supreme Lord\n------------------\n\nTangled in the various attachments of the material world, we keep forgetting that the Supreme Lord is our only permanent relative. He is the Father, Mother, Friend, Master, and Beloved of our soul.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n==================\n\n*   Attachment to bodily relatives can lead to remorse and fear of performing one's duty.\n*   Materialism leads to ignorance, causing physical burdens like pain and death.\n*   True reality lies beyond the physical body; our eternal souls are beyond life and death.\n*   The Supreme Lord is our only permanent relative, guiding us through the material world."

In fact, before the battle, when both parties were mobilizing their armies; given a choice between the entire armed Yadu army and the unarmed Lord Shree Krishna; Arjun chose the Lord, as he had complete faith in him.\n\n## The Unlikely Behavior\n\nAt this point let us consider who Arjun really was. He was definitely not a novice, bereft of spiritual knowledge. His celestial father was Indra, the king of heaven. Arjun had been to his abode and received several boons from him and other celestial beings.\n\n## Past Life: Nar\n\nIn his past life, Arjun was **Nar**, part of the twin descensions the **Nar-Narayan**; where **Nar** was the perfected soul situated in transcendental knowledge and **Narayan** the Supreme Lord. Then why in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, a grand warrior of such stature was dropping his weapons? What was the cause of his misery?\n\n## The Lord's Plan\n\nFor the benefit of future generations, Shree Krishna wanted to bring forth the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita. By intentionally confusing Arjun, the Lord had created this opportunity. In this chapter, Arjun put forth to the Lord several arguments and justifications why he should not fight this war, and in the subsequent chapters Shree Krishna has elaborated upon why Arjun’s arguments were inappropriate, and the way forward."

This compassion is of two kinds.\n\n#### Types of Compassion\n\n*   One is the divine compassion that God and the saints feel toward the souls in the material realm, on seeing their suffering in separation to God.\n*   The other is the material compassion that we feel upon seeing the bodily distress of others.\n\n#### Imperfections of Material Compassion\n\nMaterial compassion is a noble sentiment that is not perfectly directed. It is like being obsessed with the health of the car while the driver sitting within is famished for food. Arjun is experiencing this second kind of sentiment. He is overwhelmed with material pity toward his enemies gathered for battle.\n\n#### A Reflection on Arjun's State\n\nThe fact that Arjun is overcome by grief and despair shows that he is himself in dire need of compassion. Therefore, the idea of his being merciful upon others is meaningless.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Address and Purpose\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna is addressed as **“Madhusudan”**. He had slayed the demon Madhu, and hence gotten the name **Madhusudan**, or “slayer of the Madhu demon.” Here, He is about to slay the demon of doubt that has arisen in Arjun's mind and is preventing him from discharging his duty.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Role\n\nBy addressing Arjun as **“Madhusudan”**, Shree Krishna emphasizes his own divine power and role in helping Arjun overcome his doubts. The use of this title also highlights the connection between Shree Krishna's actions and Arjun's inner struggles."

    "explanation": "**The Significance of the Term \"Ārya\" in Hinduism**\n\n### Definition and Connotation\n\nThe word `Ārya` in our sacred books does not refer to any race or ethnic group. The Manu Smṛiti defines an Aryan as a highly evolved and cultured person.\n\n### Connotation of \"Aryan\"\n\n“Aryan” connotes goodness, like the term “perfect gentleman.” This ideal state of being is the aim of the Vedic scriptures, which seek to induce humans to become Aryans in all respects.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Reprimand of Arjun\n\nShree Krishna finds Arjun’s present condition in conflict with that ideal, and so reprimands him by calling attention to his confusion in how to live up to this ideal state of being under the current circumstances.\n\n**The Bhagavad Gita: A New Beginning**\n\n### The Start of a New Cycle\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, or “Song of God,” effectively begins from here because Shree Krishna, who was quiet until now, starts speaking in this verse.\n\n### Inducing Arjun to Seek Knowledge\n\nThe Supreme Lord first begins by inducing in Arjun a hunger for knowledge. He does this by pointing out that his state of confusion is dishonorable and inappropriate for virtuous persons.\n\n### The Consequences of Delusion\n\nHe then goes on to remind Arjun of the consequences of delusion, which are:\n\n* Pain\n* Infamy\n* Failure in life\n* Degradation of the soul\n\n**Shree Krishna's Uncomfortable Reprimand**\n\n### A Different Approach than Comforting\n\nRather than comforting him, Shree Krishna is making Arjun uncomfortable about his current state. We all feel uncomfortable when we are confused because it is not the natural condition of the soul.\n\n### Channeling Discomfort into Knowledge\n\nThat feeling of discontentment, if properly channeled, can become a powerful impetus to search for true knowledge.\n\n### The Role of God in Inducing Turmoil\n\nThe suitable resolution of doubt helps a person acquire a deeper understanding than before. Thus, God sometimes deliberately puts a person in turmoil, so that he or she may be forced to search for knowledge to remove the confusion.\n\n### The Reward of Resolving Doubt\n\nAnd when the doubt is finally resolved, that person reaches a higher level of understanding."

One needs to be optimistic, enthusiastic, and energetic to overcome the negativities of the material mind, such as:\n\n*   Sloth\n*   The rut of habit\n*   Ignorance\n*   Attachment\n\nShree Krishna is a skillful teacher, and thus having reprimanded Arjun, He now enhances Arjun’s internal strength to tackle the situation by encouraging him.\n\n**The Connection to Mother Kunti**\n---------------------------------\n\nBy addressing Arjun as the son of Pritha (another name for Kunti), Shree Krishna invokes him to remember his mother Kunti. She had worshipped Indra, the chief of the celestial gods, and with his blessings Arjun was born. Hence, he was endowed with extraordinary might and valor, similar to that of Indra.\n\n**Invoking Arjun's Illustrious Parentage**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna is reminding him of this, encouraging him not to yield to this impotence, which does not befit his illustrious parentage. Again, He addresses Arjun as Parantapa, or conqueror of enemies, indicating to him to vanquish the enemy that has arisen within him, namely:\n\n*   The desire for dereliction of his dutiful action as a Kshatriya, or warrior class prince\n\n**The True Nature of One's Emotions**\n--------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna goes on to explain that the way he is feeling is neither moral duty nor true compassion; rather, it is:\n\n*   Lamentation\n*   Delusion\n\nIt has its roots in weakness of mind. If his behavior was truly based on wisdom and mercy, then he would experience neither confusion nor grief.\n\n**The Path to Enlightenment**\n-----------------------------\n\nIf one can overcome the weaknesses of mind and cultivate high spirits and morale, then they will be able to successfully tread the path of enlightenment. This requires one to be optimistic, enthusiastic, and energetic, and to vanquish the enemies that arise within."

But, Arjun refutes that line of thought here.\n\n### A Refutation of the Need to Fight\n\nHe says that he would prefer to live by begging than commit this heinous crime. He further believes that if he does indulge in this heinous act of fighting the war and kills his elders and relatives, his conscience will not allow him to enjoy any of the fruits of his action in this world, such as riches and power.\n\n**A Telling Example from Shakespeare's Macbeth**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nShakespeare’s play Macbeth carries a telling example of a person not being able to enjoy even the natural state of sleep due to guilty conscience, let alone enjoy any wealth and power that comes along by immoral conduct.\n\n### The Story of Macbeth\n\nMacbeth was a nobleman of Scotland. Once while travelling, the king of Scotland came to rest the night at his house. Macbeth’s wife incited him to murder the king and usurp his throne. Macbeth got swayed by her advice and assassinated the king, and thereafter, he and Lady Macbeth were crowned as the king and queen of Scotland.\n\n### The Consequences of Guilt\n\nHowever, for years after that, Macbeth would be found walking in his palace, fully awake at night. The author writes, “Macbeth hath killed sleep, and so Macbeth shall sleep no more.” The queen would be found repeatedly washing her hands, as if to remove imaginary blood stains.\n\n### Arjun's Commiseration\n\nIn this verse, Arjun commiserates that, if he did kill these noble elders, tainted with their blood, his conscience would not let him enjoy all the royal benefits of ruling the kingdom."

    "explanation": "**The Great Devotee Bheeshma**\n=====================================\n\nWhen evaluating the most suitable course of action, one considers various alternatives and their consequences. Arjun was debating whether it would be desirable to defeat the Kauravas or to be defeated by them. Both alternatives seemed like defeat, for if he did win the war by slaying the Kauravas, he would have no further desire to live.\n\nHowever, the fact was that Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. had acted ignobly by taking the side of the unrighteous Kauravas. The word _arthakām_ has been used for them, implying, \"attached to wealth and position,\" they had taken the side of the wicked Duryodhan. So, killing them in the war was a natural consequence. In fact, after the war, Bheeshma himself admitted that a teacher who acts ignobly is fit to be abandoned.\n\n**A Great Devotee of Lord Krishna**\n---------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (verse 9.22.19), Bheeshma was a great devotee of Shree Krishna. He was a master of his senses, and an icon of chivalry and generosity. He was a knower of the Absolute Truth, and had vowed to always speak the truth in his life. Even death could only come to him when he chose to accept it.\n\n**The 12 Great Personalities**\n-------------------------------\n\nFor various reasons, Bheeshma was enumerated amongst the twelve great personalities, or _Mahājans_, mentioned in the Bhāgavatam:\n\nswayambhūr nāradaḥ śhambhuḥ kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ\nprahlādo janako bhīṣmo balir vaiyāsakir vayam\n\n(6.3.20) [v1]\n\n\"These are the twelve great knowers of religious principles—the first-born Brahma, Sage Narad, Lord Shiv, the four Kumars, Bhagavan Kapil (son of Devahuti), Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlad Maharaj, Janak Maharaj, Grandfather Bheeshma, Bali Maharaj, Shukadev Muni, and Ved Vyas.\"\n\n**Bheeshma's Actions**\n----------------------\n\nHence, Bheeshma was an enlightened soul, whose actions could never be against the principles of dharma. However, his profound character was beyond mundane reasoning.\n\nEven though he fought on the side of the Kauravas, he said to Yudhishthir (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) before the war, \"I am obliged to combat on the side of unrighteousness, but I give you the boon that you will be victorious.\" Bheeshma knew that the righteous Pandavas, who had the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna on their side, could never lose.\n\nBy taking the side of _adharma_ (unrighteousness), he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war. He thus offered the biggest sacrifice of laying down his life, to assist the divine pastimes of Lord Krishna.\n\n**A Vow Broken**\n-----------------\n\nShree Krishna was well aware of Bheeshma's deep devotion toward him, despite his fighting from the side of the Kauravas. That is why he upheld Bheeshma's vow by breaking his own.\n\nBheeshma resolved on a particular day during the war, that before sunset on the next day, he would either kill Arjun, the foremost Pandava warrior, or else to save him, Shree Krishna would have to break his own vow of not lifting weapons in the battle of Mahabharat.\n\nPoets describe the vow that Bheeshma made:\n\nāju jo harihiṅ na śhastra gahāūñ,\ntau lājahuñ gaṅgā jananī ko śhāntanu suta na kahāūñ\n\n(Saint Soordas) [v2]\n\n\"If I do not make the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna lift weapons, then I will shame my mother Ganga, and I am not the son of King Shantanu.\"\n\n**The Battle of Mahabharat**\n-----------------------------\n\nBheeshma fought so valiantly that Arjun's chariot was shattered, and he was stranded on the ground. At that stage, Shree Krishna lifted the chariot wheel and came forward to prevent Bheeshma from killing Arjun. Bheeshma saw the Lord with the chariot wheel in his hand as a weapon, and broke into a big smile. He understood that _Bhaktavatsala Bhagavān_ (God who gives pleasure to his devotees) had broken his own vow to honor the vow of his devotee.\n\n**Bheeshma's Devotion**\n------------------------\n\nIn fact, Bheeshma's devotion to Lord Krishna had a very _rasik_ (full of sweetness) flavor to it. He used to meditate on Shree Krishna's pastimes in Vrindavan.\n\nThere, in the evening when the Lord would return to the village after grazing the cows in the forest, the dust raised from the hooves of the cows would deck his charming face, increasing its beauty and sweetness. During the battle of Mahabharat, the dust raised from the hooves of the horses too added to Shree Krishna's beauty, and he loved having _darśhan_ (divine vision) of his Lord there.\n\n**The Final Stage**\n-------------------\n\nIn the last stage of his life, as he lay for six months on the bed of arrows, he meditated on that very vision of God, offering the following prayer to Him:\n\nyudhi turaga-rajo-vidhūmra-viṣhvak-kacha-lulita-śhramavāry-alaṅkṛitāsye\nmama niśhita-śharair vibhidyamāna-tvachi vilasat-kavache ’stu kṛiṣṇa ātmā\n\n(Bhāgavatam 1.9.34)\n\n[v3]\n\n\"On the battlefield, Lord Krishna's flowing hair was covered with white dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and his face was covered with sweat beads because of his physical effort in driving the chariot. These were like ornaments enhancing the beauty of my Lord; and the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows further intensified the decorations. Let my mind meditate unto that Shree Krishna.\"\n\n**Bheeshma's Departure**\n------------------------\n\nLord Krishna reciprocated his loving devotion by himself coming to meet Bheeshma on his deathbed of arrows, and with the _darśhan_ of God in front of him, Bheeshma, the great _mahājan_, left his body of his own volition."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of a Spiritual Master in Hindu Philosophy**\n=====================================================================\n\nIn Chapter 2.7 of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun requests Shree Krishna to be his Guru. This is a pivotal moment in the text as it highlights the significance of a Spiritual Master in Hindu philosophy.\n\n**Arjun's Request to Shree Krishna**\n---------------------------------\n\nArjun, who is Shree Krishna's friend and cousin, requests him to be his Guru. Arjun pleads to Shree Krishna that he has been overpowered by \"kārpaṇya doṣh\", or the flaw of cowardice in behavior. He requests the Lord to become his Guru and instruct him about the path of auspiciousness.\n\n**The Need for a Spiritual Master**\n---------------------------------\n\nAll the Vedic scriptures declare in unison that it is through the medium of a Spiritual Master that we receive divine knowledge for our eternal welfare:\n\ntadvijñānārthaṁ sa gurumevābhigachchhet samitpāṇiḥ śhrotriyaṁ brahmaniṣhṭham\n\n(\"To know the Absolute Truth, approach a Guru who is both a knower of the scriptures and is practically situated on the platform of God-realization.\")\n\ntasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śhreya uttamam\n\n(\"Seekers of the Truth should surrender themselves to a Spiritual Master who has understood the conclusion of the scriptures and taken complete shelter of God, leaving aside all material considerations.\")\n\n**The Ramayan's Perspective**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\nguru binu bhava nidhi tarai na koī, jauṅ biranchi sankara sama hoī.\n\n(\"Not even the most elevated of spiritual aspirants can cross over the material ocean without the grace of the Guru.\")\n\nShree Krishna states this himself in the Bhagavad Gita in verse 4.34:\n\n\"Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\"\n\n**Shree Krishna's Experience**\n---------------------------\n\nTo demonstrate the need for accepting a Guru to gain knowledge, Shree Krishna himself took this step. In his youth, he went to the hermitage of Sandipani Muni to learn sixty-four sciences from him. His classmate, Sudama, remarked regarding this:\n\nyasya chchhando mayaṁ brahma deha āvapanaṁ vibho\n\n(\"O Shree Krishna, the Vedas are like your body, manifested from the knowledge that you possess (hence, what requirement do you have for making a Guru). Yet, you too pretend you need to learn from a Guru; this is only your divine leela (pastime).\")\n\nShree Krishna is in fact the first Guru of the world, because he is the Guru of Brahma, the first-born in this material world. He performed this leela for our benefit, to teach by his example that we souls, who are under the influence of Maya, will need a Guru to dispel our ignorance.\n\n**Arjun's Surrender to Shree Krishna**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Arjun takes the step of surrendering to Shree Krishna as his disciple, and requests his Guru to enlighten him regarding the proper course of action.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the importance of a Spiritual Master in Hindu philosophy. A Guru can provide divine knowledge, dispel ignorance, and guide us on the path of auspiciousness. Shree Krishna's example demonstrates that even a divine being can benefit from the guidance of a Guru, and we should follow his example by seeking the guidance of our own Gurus."

Since Arjun's problems are looming bigger than his feeble intellectual abilities, his material knowledge is insufficient in saving him from the ocean of grief that he finds himself in. Having accepted Shree Krishna as his Guru, Arjun now pours out his heart to him, to reveal his pitiable state.\n\n### A Universal Struggle\n\nArjun's situation is not unique. This is invariably the situation we sometimes find ourselves in as we go through the journey of life. We want happiness, but we experience misery; we desire knowledge, but are unable to lift the cloud of ignorance; we crave perfect love, but repeatedly meet with disappointment.\n\n### The Limitations of Material Knowledge\n\nOur college degrees, acquired knowledge, and mundane scholarships do not provide solutions to these perplexities of life. We need divine knowledge to solve the puzzle of life.\n\n### The Path to Enlightenment\n\nSuch is the path Arjun has decided to take.

Arjun is lamenting, for what he feels are very valid reasons. But, rather than commiserating with him, Shree Krishna takes the wind out of his arguments. He says, “Arjun, though you may feel you are speaking words of wisdom, you are actually speaking and acting out of ignorance. No possible reason justifies lamentation. The Pundits—those who are wise—never lament, neither for the living nor for the dead. Hence the grief you visualize in killing your relatives is illusory, and it proves that you are not a Pundit.”\n\n**The Wisdom of Grandsire Bheeshma**\n---------------------------------\n\nOne does not need to go far into the Gita to find a wise person above lamentation, for Grandsire Bheeshma himself was the perfect example. He was a sage who had fathomed the mysteries of life and death, and risen above the dualities of circumstances. Serene in any eventuality, he had even consented to taking the side of the wicked, if it served the Lord.

    "explanation": "**The Significance of Gnothi Seauton**\n=====================================\n\nOn the gate of the temple of Apollo at Delphi are inscribed the words, **Gnothi Seuton**, or \"Know Thyself\". Even Socrates, the wise old man of Athens, was fond of encouraging people to inquire into the nature of the self. A local legend goes like this:\n\n### Socrates and the Question of Identity\n\nOnce, Socrates was walking on the street, absorbed in deep philosophic contemplation, when he accidentally bumped into someone. That man blurted in annoyance, \"Can't you see where you walk? Who are you?\" Socrates answered with amusement, \"My dear fellow, I have been pondering over that question for the last forty years. If you ever come to know who I am, please let me know.\"\n\n**The Vedic Tradition and the Nature of the Self**\n=====================================================\n\nIn the Vedic tradition, whenever divine knowledge is imparted, it usually begins with knowledge of the self. Shree Krishna follows this same approach in the Bhagavad Gita, with a piece of information that would have swept Socrates off his feet. Shree Krishna begins by explaining that the entity that we call the \"self\" is really the soul, not the material body, and is eternal, just as God himself is eternal.\n\n**The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad and the Concept of Eternal Creation**\n====================================================================\n\nThe above verse states that creation is a combination of three entities—God, soul, and Maya—and all the three entities are eternal. If we believe the soul is eternal, then it follows logically that there is life after death of the material body. Shree Krishna talks about this in the next verse.\n\n**The Implication of Eternal Creation**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIf we accept that creation is eternal and involves three essential entities, it logically follows that there is a continuation of life after death of the material body. This idea is supported by Shree Krishna's teachings in the Bhagavad Gita, which explores the nature of the self and the consequences of an eternal creation."

    "explanation": "**The Principle of Reincarnation**\n=====================================\n\nWith immaculate logic, Shree Krishna establishes the principle of transmigration of the soul from lifetime to lifetime. He explains that in one lifetime itself, we change bodies from childhood to youth to maturity and then to old age. In fact, modern science informs us that cells within the body undergo regeneration—old cells die away and new ones take their place. It is estimated that within seven years, practically all the cells of the body change.\n\nFurther, the molecules within the cells change even more rapidly. With every breath we inhale, oxygen molecules are absorbed into our cells via the metabolic processes, and molecules that were heretofore locked within the cells are released as carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that in one year’s time, about ninety-eight percent of our bodily molecules change.\n\nAnd yet, despite the continual change of the body, we perceive that we are the same person. That is because we are not the material body, but the spiritual soul seated within.\n\n**The Concept of Deha and Dehi**\n-------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, the word \"deha\" means \"the body\" and \"dehi\" means \"possessor of the body,\" or the soul. Shree Krishna draws Arjun’s attention to the fact that, since the body is constantly changing, in one lifetime itself, the soul passes through many bodies. Similarly, at the time of death, it passes into another body.\n\nActually, what we term as \"death\" in worldly parlance is merely the soul discarding its old dysfunctional body, and what we call \"birth\" is the soul taking on a new body elsewhere. This is the principle of reincarnation.\n\n**Reincarnation Across Cultures and Philosophies**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nMost Oriental philosophies accept this concept of reincarnation. It is an integral part of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In Buddhism, the Buddha made references to his past lives repeatedly.\n\nMany people do not know the extent to which reincarnation was a part of the belief system of the Occidental philosophies as well. In ancient classical Western religious and philosophic circles, famous thinkers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates accepted reincarnation to be true.\n\nTheir views were also reflected in Orphism, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Manichaenism, and Gnosticism. Within the mainstream Abrahamic faiths, mystics of the three major religions also supported reincarnation.\n\nExamples include Jews who studied the Kabbalah, the Christian Cathars, and Muslim Shia sects such as the Alawi Shias and the Druze.\n\n**Historical References to Reincarnation**\n----------------------------------------\n\nFor example, amongst Occidental religions, Josephus, the great ancient Jewish historian, used language in his writings that seem to ascribe belief in some form of reincarnation among the Pharisees and Essenes of his day.\n\nCertainly the Jewish Kabbalah prescribes to the idea of reincarnation as gilgul neshamot, or the \"rolling of the soul.\"\n\nThe great Sufi mystic, Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi declared:\n\n\"I died out of the stone and I became a plant;\nI died out of the plant and became an animal;\nI died out of the animal and became a man.\n\nWhy then should I fear to die?\nWhen did I grow less by dying?\nI shall die out of man and shall become an angel!\" [v10]\n\n**Christianity and Reincarnation**\n---------------------------------\n\nMany of the early Christians believed in the concept of reincarnation. Christian history informs us that, in the 553 AD, the Council of Nicaea, a conclave, was held to discuss the principle of reincarnation, and it was thereafter declared a heresy.\n\nApparently, this decision increased the authority of the Church over the lives of the people. Until then, it was commonly accepted.\n\nJesus indirectly proclaimed this doctrine when he told his disciples that John the Baptist was Elijah the Prophet reincarnated (Matthew 11:13-14, Matthew 17:10-13).\n\nThis is also mentioned in the Old Testament (Malachi 4:5). Origen, the most learned of the Christian Fathers, declared: \"Every man receives a body for himself according to his deserts in former lives [v11].\"\n\nSolomon’s Book of Wisdom says: \"To be born in sound body with sound limbs is a reward of the virtues of the past lives.\" (Wisdom of Solomon 8:19-20) [v12]\n\n**Contemporary Views on Reincarnation**\n--------------------------------------\n\nBelief in reincarnation is also found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia.\n\nMoving to more recent centuries and civilizations, reincarnation has been affirmed by Rosicrucians, Spiritism, Theosophists, and New Age followers.\n\nEven more recently, it has even been studied in serious scientific circles at major universities, exemplified by the works of Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker, both at the University of Virginia.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nWithout accepting the concept of rebirth, it is difficult to make sense out of the suffering, chaos, and incompleteness of the world.\n\nHence, many famous western thinkers believed in this principle. Virgil and Ovid regarded this doctrine as self-evident.\n\nThe German philosophers Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, and Lessing accepted it. Amongst the more recent philosophers, Hume, Spencer, and Max Mueller, all recognized it as an incontrovertible doctrine.\n\nAmong Western poets, Browing, Rosetti, Tennyson, and Wordsworth, to mention just a few, all believed in it.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Explanation**\n------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna has previously declared that the wise do not lament. But the fact remains that we do experience happiness and distress.\n\nWhat is the reason for it? He now explains this concept."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Sensations**\n=====================================\n\n### Introduction to the Five Senses\n---------------------------------\n\nThe human body houses five senses—the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing—and these, in contact with their objects of perception, give rise to sensations of happiness and distress.\n\n### The Transitory Nature of Sensations\n---------------------------------------\n\nNone of these sensations is permanent. They come and go like the changing seasons.\n\n*   **Seasonal Variations**: A person can experience pleasure from cool water in the summer, but discomfort when the same water is cold in the winter.\n*   **Transitory Perceptions**: Both the feelings of happiness and distress experienced through the senses are transient.\n*   **Tolerance is Key**: If we permit ourselves to be affected by these sensations, we will sway like a pendulum from side to side.\n\n### The Role of Discrimination\n---------------------------------\n\nA person of discrimination should practice tolerating both the feelings of happiness and distress without being disturbed by them.\n\n### Vipassanā: The Technique of Tolerance\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe technique of **Vipassanā**, which is the primary technique of self-realization in Buddhism, is based on this principle of tolerance of sense perceptions.\n\n### Eliminating Desire Through Vipassanā\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIts practice helps eliminate desire, which is the cause of all suffering.\n\n*   **The Four Noble Truths**: According to Buddhist philosophy, desire is the root of suffering.\n*   **The Vedic Connection**: This principle is rooted in the vast and profound Vedic philosophy.\n\n### Conclusion\n--------------\n\nBy understanding and embracing the transitory nature of sensations, we can cultivate tolerance and eventually eliminate desire. This is a fundamental principle in Buddhism that has been widely discussed.\n\n**Vipassanā: The Mindfulness of All Phenomena**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe practice of **Vipassanā** helps develop this understanding, enabling us to observe our thoughts, feelings, and actions without attachment or aversion.\n\n**The Power of Self-Realization**\n------------------------------------\n\nThrough **Vipassanā**, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.\n\n### The End Result\n-----------------\n\nThe elimination of desire is a direct consequence of practicing **Vipassanā**, leading to an increase in happiness and well-being."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Purpose of Discrimination**\n=====================================================\n\nIn the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that both the sensations of happiness and distress are fleeting. He now encourages Arjun to rise above these dualities through discrimination. In order to develop this discrimination, we first need to understand the answers to two important questions:\n\n### Understanding Our Aspirations\n\n1. Why do we aspire for happiness?\n2. Why doesn’t material happiness satisfy us?\n\n**The Answer to the First Question**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe answer to the first question is very simple. God is an ocean of infinite bliss, and we souls are his tiny parts. This basically means that we are tiny fragments of an infinite ocean of bliss.\n\n**An Analogy**\n-------------\n\nSwami Vivekananda would address people by saying, “O ye children of immortal bliss.” Just as a child is drawn to his or her mother, each part is naturally drawn toward its whole. Similarly, being infinitesimal parts of the ocean of bliss, we souls too are drawn to this bliss.\n\n**The Purpose of Our Actions**\n-----------------------------\n\nHence, everything we do in the world is for the sake of happiness. We all may have different views regarding where happiness lies or what form it might take, but all living beings seek nothing apart from it.\n\n**Understanding the Second Question**\n--------------------------------------\n\nNow, let’s understand the answer to the second question. The soul, being a tiny part of God, is divine in nature like God himself.\n\n**The Characteristics of Divine Happiness**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHence the happiness that the soul seeks is also divine. Such happiness must possess the following three characteristics:\n\n*   It must be infinite in extent.\n*   It must be permanent.\n*   It must be ever-fresh.\n\n**The Reality of Divine Happiness**\n--------------------------------------\n\nSuch is the happiness of God, which is described as sat-chit-ānand, or eternal-sentient-ocean of bliss. However, the happiness we experience from the contact of the senses with their objects is the reverse; it is temporary, finite, and insentient.\n\n**The Limitations of Material Happiness**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThus, the material happiness that we perceive through the body can never satisfy the divine soul.\n\n**The Path to Discrimination**\n------------------------------\n\nWith this discrimination, we must practice to tolerate the perception of material happiness. Similarly, we must tolerate the sensation of material distress.\n\n**The Ultimate Goal**\n-------------------\n\nOnly then will we rise above these dualities and the material energy will no longer bind us.\n\n**Further Discussion**\n----------------------\n\nThis second aspect is discussed in detail in many future verses, such as 2.48, 5.20, etc.\n\n**Rising Above Dualities**\n-------------------------\n\nWith the practice of discrimination, we can rise above these dualities and become free from the material energy that binds us."

This concept is rooted in the eternal nature of Brahman, which is described as Sat-Chit-Ānand.\n\n### The Three Entities\n\n#### 1. God (Brahman)\n\n*   According to the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad, God is everlasting and can be referred to as Sat-Chit-Ānand (eternal-full of knowledge-ocean of bliss).\n*   The soul is also Sat, but it is tiny (Aṇu) and can be described as Aṇu Sat, Aṇu Chit, and Aṇu ānand.\n*   Maya, the entity from which the world has been made, is eternal (Sat) but gives rise to temporary objects and phenomena.\n\n### The Nature of the World\n\n*   While the world is fleeting (Asat) and gives rise to temporary objects, it is not non-existent (Mithyā).\n*   The idea that the world is Mithyā is contradicted by the fact that God pervades every atom of the world.\n\n### What does it mean for God to be all-pervading?\n\n*   According to the Taittirīya Upaniṣhad, God is all-pervading in the world.\n*   This means that even God-realized Saints cannot deny the existence of the world, as they still need to eat and interact with their surroundings.\n\n### The World is Asat but not Mithyā\n\n*   Shree Krishna explains that the world is fleeting (Asat) and temporary, but not non-existent (Mithyā).\n*   This understanding is rooted in the eternal nature of Brahman and its pervasiveness throughout the world.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The concept of Sat-Chit-Ānand presents a profound understanding of the nature of reality.\n*   The idea that the world is Asat but not Mithyā highlights the complexity and depth of Indian philosophical thought.\n\n**References**\n\n*   Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad\n*   Taittirīya Upaniṣhad\n*   Bhagavad Gita (2.6.4)"

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Relationship Between Body and Soul**\n===========================================================\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, Shree Krishna explains that the soul pervades the body by spreading its consciousness throughout it. This concept establishes a strong relationship between the body and the soul, highlighting their interconnectedness.\n\n**The Soul's Consciousness**\n-------------------------\n\nThe soul is sentient and possesses consciousness, while the body is made from insentient matter devoid of consciousness. However, the soul passes on the quality of consciousness to the body by residing in it. This means that the soul's consciousness spreads throughout the body, making it a unified entity.\n\n**Location of the Soul**\n----------------------\n\nSome raise a question regarding the location of the soul, citing verses from the Vedas that state it resides in the heart:\n\n> hṛidi hyeṣha ātmā (Praśhnopaniṣhad 3.6) [v18]\n> sa vā eṣha ātmā hṛidi (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 8.3.3) [v19]\n\nThe word `hṛidi` indicates that the soul is seated in the region of the heart. Yet, consciousness spreads throughout the body.\n\n**The Soul's Infusion into the Body**\n-----------------------------------\n\nVed Vyas explains this concept, stating:\n\n> avirodhaśhchandanavat (Brahma Sūtra 2.3.23) [v20]\n> “Just as applying sandalwood to your forehead cools the entire body, similarly, the soul, although residing locally in the heart, infuses its consciousness throughout the body.”\n\n**The Spread of Consciousness**\n------------------------------\n\nAnother way to understand how consciousness spreads into the body is by comparing it to fragrance. Just as a flower's fragrance can infuse the entire garden, the soul's consciousness can make the dead matter of the body sentient by pervading its consciousness.\n\n> vyaktireko gandhavat (Brahma Sūtra 2.3.26) [v21]\n> “Fragrance is a quality of the flower. But the garden where the flower grows also becomes fragrant.”"

This may seem like an exaggeration, but it's a matter of fact.\n\n### The Cycle of Transformation\n\nOur bodies are composed of various foods that we consume, such as vegetables, fruits, grains, lentils, and grass. Cows graze on the grass and produce milk, which we humans consume and eventually transform into our own bodies.\n\nAnd at the time of death, when the soul departs, the body can have one of three endings:\n\n*   **Burning**: The body is burnt, and it's converted to ashes. This process transforms the mud into a new form.\n*   **Burial**: The body is buried, and insects eat it, transforming it into mud.\n*   **River**: The body is thrown into a river, where sea creatures consume it and excrete waste that merges with the mud of the seabed.\n\n**The Cycle Continues**\n\nThis cycle is a reminder that everything in our world is interconnected and constantly changing. We are made of mud, and we eventually return to being part of the mud.\n\n**A Message from the Bible**\n\nAs stated in Genesis 3:19, \"For dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\" This phrase refers to our material bodies.\n\n**The Divine Soul**\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that within the material body lies an eternal and imperishable entity – the divine soul, our real self.\n\n### Quotes\n\n*   \"For dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\" - Genesis 3:19\n*   \"Within that material body is an eternal imperishable entity, which is not made of mud.

Similarly, in the illusion that we are the body, we fear the experience of death.\n\n**The Fear of Death**\n-------------------\n\nFor the enlightened soul whose illusion has been dispelled, this fear of death vanishes. One may ask that if nobody can kill anyone, then why is murder considered a punishable offense?\n\n**The Body as a Vehicle**\n---------------------------\n\nThe answer is that the body is the vehicle of the soul, and destroying any living being's vehicle is violence, which is forbidden. The Vedas clearly instruct:\n\nmā hinsyāt sarvabhūtāni\n[v24]\n\n\"Do not commit violence toward anyone.\" In fact, the Vedas even consider killing of animals as a crime. However, there are occasions where the rules change and even violence becomes necessary.\n\n**Exceptions to Violence**\n---------------------------\n\nFor example, in cases where a snake is approaching to bite, or if one is attacked with lethal weapons, or one's life sustenance is being snatched away, then violence is permitted for self-protection.\n\n**Arjun's Dilemma**\n-------------------\n\nIn the present situation, what is appropriate for Arjun, violence or non-violence, and why?

    "explanation": "**The Nature of the Soul: Rebirth and Karma**\n\n### Shree Krishna's Explanation\n\nContinuing to explain the nature of the soul, Shree Krishna reiterates the concept of rebirth, comparing it to an everyday activity. When garments become torn and useless, we discard them in favor of new ones, but in doing so we do not change ourselves. In the same manner, the soul remains unchanged, when it discards its worn-out body and takes birth in a new body elsewhere.\n\n### The Nyāya Darśhan's Argument\n\nThe Nyāya Darśhan gives the following argument to prove the existence of rebirth:\n\n**Argument 1: Observing a Baby's Emotions**\n\njātasya harṣhabhayaśhoka sampratipatteḥ \n(3.1.18) [v27]\n\nIt states that if you observe a little baby, you will find it sometimes becomes happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes fearful, without any apparent reason. According to the Nyāya Darśhan, the little baby is remembering its past life, and hence experiencing these emotions. However, as it grows up, the impressions of the present life are imprinted so strongly upon its mind, that they erase most past memories.\n\n**Argument 2: The Baby's Ability to Suckle**\n\nstanyābhilāṣhāt \n(3.1.21) [v28]\n\nIt says that a newborn baby has no knowledge of language. How then can a mother teach her baby to suckle her breast when she inserts it in the baby's mouth? However, the newborn child has drunk milk in infinite past lifetimes, even in animal forms, from the breasts, teats, and udders of innumerable mothers. Hence, when the mother puts her breast in the baby's mouth, it automatically starts suckling based on past practice.\n\n### The Implications of Not Believing in Rebirth\n\nWithout accepting the concept of rebirth, the disparity between human beings becomes inexplicable and irrational. For example:\n\n**The Case of a Man Born Blind**\n\nLet us suppose one man is blind from birth. If that person asks why he was punished in this way, what logical answer can be given to him? If we say it was a result of his karmas, he may argue that the present life is the only life he has, and therefore, there are no past karmas at the time of birth that should afflict him. If we say it was the will of God, it would also seem implausible, since God is all-merciful and would not unnecessarily want anyone to be blind. The only logical explanation is that the person was born blind as a consequence of karmas from past lives.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, from common sense and on the authority of the scriptures we are obliged to believe in the concept of rebirth. Without accepting this concept, the disparity between human beings becomes inexplicable and irrational. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that rebirth is a fundamental aspect of life."

During the period of their exile in the forest, one day while wandering the five Pandavas were thirsty and came across a well.\n\n#### The Well of Death\n\nYudhishthir asked Bheem to go and fetch water for all of them. When Bheem reached the well, a yakṣha (semi-celestial being) began speaking from inside the well, “I will only let you take the water if you first answer my questions.” Bheem paid no heed and proceeded to draw water. The yakṣha pulled him in.\n\nAfter some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water. When Arjun reached the well, the yakṣha asked him too, “I have already seized your brother. Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.” Arjun also paid no heed, and the yakṣha pulled him into the well. The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate. Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well.\n\n#### The Yakṣha: Disguise of Yamraj\n\nOnce again, the yakṣha said, “Answer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.” Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions. The yakṣha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise.\n\n#### The Power of Wisdom\n\nThe yakṣha asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir.

Sage Narad instructed Yudhishthir along similar lines, in Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam:\n\n\"Whether you consider the personality to be an eternal soul or to be a temporary body, or even if you accept it as an inconceivable mixture of soul and body, you should not lament in any way. The cause for lamentation is only attachment that arises out of illusion.\"\n\n**The Three Bodies: Gross, Subtle, and Causal**\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn the material realm, each individual soul is bound by three bodies:\n\n### Gross Body\n Consists of the five gross elements of nature:\n- Earth\n- Water\n- Fire\n- Air\n- Space\n\n### Subtle Body\n Consists of eighteen elements:\n- Five life-airs\n- Five working senses\n- Five knowledge senses\n- Mind\n- Intellect\n- Ego\n\n### Causal Body\n Consists of the account of karmas from endless past lives, including the:\n- Sanskārs (tendencies) carried forward from previous lives\n\n**The Transcendence of Death**\n==========================\n\nAt the time of death, the soul discards its gross body and departs with the subtle and causal bodies. God again gives the soul another gross body according to its subtle and causal bodies, and sends the soul into a suitable mother's womb for the purpose.\n\nAfter the soul gives up one gross body, there is a transitional phase before it receives a new gross body. This could be a few seconds in duration or a few years long.\n\nSo before birth, the soul existed with the unmanifest subtle and causal bodies. After death, it still exists in the unmanifest state. It only becomes manifest in the middle.\n\nSo death is no reason for grief."

    "explanation": "**The Science of Work**\n=======================\n\n### Motivation and Karmas\n\n2.38 Having motivated Arjun from the mundane level, Shree Krishna now moves deeper into the science of work. Arjun had expressed his fear that by killing his enemies he would incur sin. Shree Krishna addresses this apprehension.\n\nHe advises Arjun to do his duty, without attachment to the fruits of his actions. Such an attitude to work will release him from any sinful reactions.\n\n### Attachment and Karmas\n\nWhen we work with selfish motives, we create karmas, which bring about their subsequent karmic reactions.\n\nThe Māṭhar Śhruti states:\n```latex\npuṇyena puṇya lokaṁ nayati pāpena pāpamubhābhyāmeva manuṣhyalokam \n[v34]\n“If you do good deeds, you will go to the celestial abodes; if you do bad deeds, you will go to the nether regions; if you do a mixture of both, you will come back to the planet Earth.” In either case, we get bound by the reactions of our karmas. Thus, mundane good deeds are also binding. They result in material rewards, which add to the stockpile of our karmas and thicken the illusion that there is happiness in the world.\n```\n### Binding Nature of Karmas\n\nHowever, if we give up selfish motives, then our actions no longer create any karmic reactions. For example:\n\n*   Murder is a sin, and the judicial law of every country of the world declares it to be a punishable offence. But if a policeman in the discharge of his duty kills the leader of a gang of bandits, he is not punished for it. If a soldier kills an enemy soldier in battle, he is not punished for it. In fact, he can even be awarded a medal for bravery.\n*   The reason for apparent lack of punishment is that these actions are not motivated by any ill-will or personal motive; they are performed as a matter of duty to the country.\n\n### God's Law\n\nGod’s law is quite similar. If one gives up all selfish motives and works merely for the sake of duty toward the Supreme, such work does not create any karmic reactions.\n\n### Attitude and Outcome\n\nSo Shree Krishna advises Arjun to become detached from outcomes and simply focus on doing his duty. When he fights with the attitude of equanimity, treating victory and defeat, pleasure and pain as the same, then despite killing his enemies, he will never incur sin.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis subject is also repeated later in the Bhagavad Gita, in verse 5.10:\n```latex\n“Just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water, those who dedicate all their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin.”\n```\n\n### Further Explanation\n\nHaving declared a profound conclusion about work without attachment, Shree Krishna now says that he will explain the science of work in detail, to reveal the logic behind what he has said."

    "explanation": "**Sānkhya Darshan: A Philosophical Framework**\n=====================================================\n\n### Overview of Sānkhya Philosophy\n\n2.39 The word `Sānkhya` comes from the roots `Sāṅ`, meaning “complete,” and `khyā`, meaning “to know.” So `Sānkhya` means the “complete analytical knowledge of something.”\n\n### Enumerating Entities in Cosmos\n\nThe Sankhya Darshan, which is one of the six philosophical treatises in Indian philosophy, makes an analytical enumeration of the entities in cosmos. It lists twenty-four entities:\n\n* `Pañch-mahābhūta` (earth, water, fire, air, and sky)\n* `Pañch tanmātrā` (the five abstract qualities of matter—taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight)\n* `Pañch karmendriya` (five working senses)\n* `Pañch jñānendriya` (five knowledge senses)\n* Mind\n* `Ahankār` (the entity created by the evolution of `mahān`)\n* `Mahān` (the entity created by evolution of `prakṛiti`)\n* `Prakṛiti` (the primordial form of the material energy)\n\n### The Entity Created by Evolution\n\nApart from these is `puruṣh` or the soul, which tries to enjoy `prakṛiti`, and gets bound in it.\n\n### The Science of Working Without Desire for Rewards\n\nShree Krishna has just explained to Arjun another form of `Sānkhya`, which is the analytical knowledge of the immortal soul. He now says that he is going to reveal the science of working without desire for rewards.\n\nThis requires detachment from the fruits of actions. Such detachment comes by practicing discrimination with the intellect.\n\n### The Yog of the Intellect\n\nHence, Shree Krishna has interestingly called it `buddhi yog`, or “Yog of the Intellect.”\n\n### The Role of Intellect in Detachment\n\nIn subsequent verses (2.41 and 2.44), he goes on to explain how the intellect plays an important role in bringing the mind to a state of detachment."

    "explanation": "**The Great Danger of Not Utilizing Human Form**\n\n2.40 The great danger we face is that we may not get the human form in the next life, and instead go into the lower species of life, such as animals, birds, the nether regions, etc. We cannot be complacent that the human form will remain reserved for us, for the next birth will be determined by our karmas and level of consciousness in this life.\n\n**Understanding the Species Below Human Beings**\n\nThere are 8.4 million species of life in existence. The species below human beings—animals, birds, fishes, insects, birds, etc.—do not have an evolved intellect as we humans do. Yet, they also perform commonplace activities such as eating, sleeping, defending, and mating.\n\n**The Misuse of Human Faculty**\n\nHuman beings have been endowed with the faculty of knowledge, for a higher purpose, so that they may utilize it to elevate themselves. If humans utilize their intellects merely for doing the animalistic activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, in a deluxe way, it is a misuse of the human form. For example:\n\n*   If someone makes eating as the primary pleasure of life, then the body of a pig becomes more suitable for such a person, and thus, that individual receives a pig’s body in the next life.\n*   If someone makes sleeping the goal of life, then God deems that the body of a polar bear is more suitable for such activity and allots it in the succeeding life.\n\n**The Warning from the Vedas**\n\nThe Vedas state:\n\n*   \"O human being, the human birth is a rare opportunity. If you do not utilize it to achieve your goal, you will suffer great ruin.\" (Kenopaniṣhad 2.5)\n*   \"If you do not strive for God-realization in this life, you will continue to rotate in the 8.4 million species of life for many births.\" (Kaṭhopaniṣhad 2.3.4)\n\n**The Rewards of Spiritual Practice**\n\nHowever, once we commence on the journey of spiritual practice then even if we do not complete the path in this life, God sees that our intention to do so existed. Therefore, he grants us the human birth again, to enable us to continue from where we had left off. In this way, we avert the great danger.\n\n**The Benefits of Spiritual Practice**\n\nAlso, Shree Krishna says that no loss ever comes from endeavor made on this path. This is because whatever material assets we accumulate in the present life have to be left behind at the time of death. But if we make any spiritual advancement on the path of Yog, God preserves it, and gives us the fruits in the next life, enabling us to start off from where we had left.\n\n**Working Without Attachment**\n\nThus, having informed Arjun about its benefits, Shree Krishna now begins instructing him about the science of working without attachment."

    "explanation": "**The Attachment Function**\n==========================\n\n### Understanding Attachment\n-----------------------------------\n\n2.41 Attachment is a function of the mind. Its manifestation is that the mind repeatedly runs toward the object of its attachment, which could be persons, sensual objects, prestige, bodily comfort, situations, and so on. So if thoughts of some person or object repeatedly come to the mind, it is a possible indication of the mind being attached to it. However, if it is the mind that gets attached, then why is Shree Krishna bringing the intellect into the topic of attachment? Is there any role of the intellect in eliminating attachment?\n\n### The Role of Intellect\n-------------------------\n\nWithin our body is the subtle \nantaḥ karaṇ\n, which we also colloquially refer to as the heart. It consists of the mind, the intellect, and the ego. In this subtle machine, the intellect is superior to the mind. It makes decisions while the mind creates desires and gets attached to the object of affection as determined by the intellect. For instance, if the intellect decides that money is the source of happiness, the mind hankers for wealth. If the intellect decides that prestige is the most important thing in life, the mind craves for reputation and fame. In other words, the mind develops desires in accordance with the knowledge of the intellect.\n\n### Intellect vs. Mind\n-----------------------\n\nThroughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect. While sitting at home, we adopt informal postures in which the mind finds comfort. Yet, we adopt appropriate formal postures while sitting in the office. It is not that the mind enjoys the formality of the office—given its way, it would rather embrace the informality of home. However, the intellect decides that formal behavior is necessary in the office. So the intellect controls the mind, and people sit formally all day long, following the decorum of the workplace, against the nature of the mind. Similarly, the mind does not enjoy doing office work—if it had its way, it would rather sit at home and watch television. But the intellect rules that working in office is necessary to earn a living. Therefore, the intellect again reins in the natural tendency of the mind, and people work eight hours a day, or longer.\n\n### Conclusion\n-------------\n\nThe above examples illustrate that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind. Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction.\n\n### Detaching the Mind from Fruits of Actions\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBuddhi yog is the art of detaching the mind from the fruits of actions, by developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work is meant for the pleasure of God. Such a person of resolute intellect cultivates single-minded focus on the goal, and traverses the path like an arrow released from the bow. This resolve becomes so strong in higher stages of \nsādhanā\n that nothing can deter the \nsādhak\n from treading the path. He or she thinks, “Even if there are millions of obstacles on my path, even if the whole world condemns me, even if I have to lay down my life, I will still not give up my \nsādhanā\n.” But those whose intellect is many-branched find their mind running in various directions. They are unable to develop the focus of mind that is required to tread the path to God.\n\n### Key Points\n-------------\n\n*   The intellect can control the mind and guide it in the proper direction.\n*   Cultivating the intellect with proper knowledge is essential for detaching the mind from fruits of actions.\n*   A resolute decision of the intellect is necessary for treading the path to God, even in the face of obstacles."

They engage their intellects in enhancing their income and contemplating how to increase their material possessions and maximize their enjoyment.\n\n### The Consequences of Materialistic Thoughts\n\n*   These individuals become bewildered in their pursuit of material possessions.\n*   They are unable to develop the firm resolve required for traversing the path to God-realization.\n\n**The Impact on Spiritual Growth**\n\nIn this manner, those who are consumed by materialistic thoughts and desires are unable to cultivate the necessary mental clarity and focus required for spiritual growth.\n\n### The Limitations of Materialistic Minds\n\n*   They are unable to comprehend the true nature of reality.\n*   Their attachment to material possessions and sensual enjoyment prevents them from experiencing spiritual liberation.\n\n**The Need for Spiritual Awareness**\n\nIn contrast, those who are aware of the true nature of reality are able to transcend materialistic desires and cultivate a deeper understanding of the universe.\n\n### The Path to Spiritual Realization\n\n*   This path requires the development of a firm resolve and mental clarity.\n*   It involves letting go of material possessions and sensual enjoyment, and cultivating a deeper connection with the divine.\n\n**The Importance of Spiritual Awareness**\n\nSpiritual awareness is necessary for achieving true liberation and understanding the nature of reality."

    "explanation": "**The Three Modes of Material Nature**\n=====================================\n\nThe material energy binds the divine soul to the bodily conception of life, by its three constituent modes. These modes of material nature are:\n\n*   **Sattva** (mode of goodness)\n*   **Rajas** (mode of passion)\n*   **Tamas** (mode of ignorance)\n\n### Variability in the Relative Proportion of the Three Modes\n\nThe relative proportion of the three modes varies for every individual, due to their **sanskārs** (tendencies) from countless past lives. This means that everyone has different inclinations and tendencies.\n\n### Accommodating Different Types of People\n\nThe Vedic scriptures accept this disparity and give suitable instructions for all kinds of people. If the **śhāstras** did not contain instructions for worldly-minded people, they would have gone further astray.\n\n### Material Rewards for Ritualistic Ceremonies\n\nThe Vedas offer material rewards for the performance of rigorous rituals, helping them rise from the mode of ignorance to passion, and from passion to goodness.\n\n### Two Kinds of Knowledge in the Vedas\n\nThe Vedas contain both kinds of knowledge:\n\n*   **Ritualistic ceremonies for the materially attached**\n*   **Divine knowledge for spiritual aspirants**\n\n### Understanding Shree Krishna's Statement\n--------------------------------------\n\nWhen Shree Krishna tells Arjun to reject the Vedas, the statement needs to be understood in the context of the preceding and following verses. He is implying that Arjun should not be attracted by the section of the Vedas that propounds rules, regulations, and ceremonies for material rewards.\n\n### Elevating Oneself to the Level of Absolute Truth\n\nInstead, he should use the divine section of the Vedic knowledge to elevate himself to the level of Absolute Truth."

    "explanation": "**The Vedas: A Spiritual Guide**\n=====================================\n\n### The Ultimate Goal of the Vedic Mantras\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Vedas contain 100,000 mantras, describing varieties of rituals, practices, prayers, ceremonies, and gems of knowledge. All these are given with only one aim—to help unite the soul with God.\n\n**The Quotes**\n-------------\n\n### Bhāgavatam 1.2.28-29\n> \"The goal of all the Vedic mantras, the ritualistic activities, spiritual practices, sacrifices, cultivation of knowledge, and performance of duties, is to help the soul reach the divine feet of God.\"\n\n### Bhāgavatam 11.11.32\n> \"The Vedas prescribe varieties of social and ritualistic duties for individuals. But those who grasp their underlying motive, and rejecting all intermediate instructions, wholeheartedly fulfill their duty toward me, I consider them to be the highest devotees.\"\n\n### The Explanation\n-------------------\n\nThe Vedas are not merely a collection of rituals and practices, but a spiritual guide that aims to help the soul unite with God. On the surface, the Vedas may appear to provide material allurements to attract those who are materially-minded. However, this is only a sugar-coated exterior that hides the true purpose of the Vedas.\n\nThe underlying motive of the Vedas is to help the soul gradually detach from the world and become attached to God. This can be achieved by attaching the mind to God, which is the ultimate goal of all the Vedic mantras. Shree Krishna advises Uddhav that those who grasp this underlying motive and reject all intermediate instructions will wholeheartedly fulfill their duty toward him.\n\nIn essence, the Vedas are a spiritual guide that aims to help the soul reach the divine feet of God. It is up to the individual to grasp this underlying motive and fulfill their duty toward God, thereby becoming a true devotee."

    "explanation": "**The Bhagavad Gita: Verse 2.47**\n=====================================\n\nThis verse is extremely popular and widely recognized, even among school children in India. It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted when discussing the topic of karm yog.\n\n**Four Instructions Regarding the Science of Work**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe verse provides four instructions regarding the science of work:\n\n*   Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results.\n*   The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment.\n*   Even while working, give up the pride of doership.\n*   Do not be attached to inaction.\n\n**Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. A number of factors come into play in determining the results, including:\n\n*   Our efforts\n*   Destiny (our past karmas)\n*   The will of God\n*   The efforts of others\n*   The cumulative karmas of the people involved\n*   The place and situation (a matter of luck)\n\nIf we become anxious for results, we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. Therefore, Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and focus solely on doing a good job.\n\n**A Humorous Acronym: NATO or Not Attached to Outcome**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsidering its application to a simple everyday activity such as playing golf, when people play golf they are often engrossed in the fruits—whether their score is under par, over par, etc. If they could merely focus on playing the shots to the best of their ability, they would find it the most enjoyable game of golf they have ever played. Additionally, with their complete focus on the shot being played, their game would be raised to a higher level.\n\n**The Fruits of Your Actions are Not for Your Enjoyment**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo perform actions is an integral part of human nature. Having come into this world, we all have various duties determined by our family situation, social position, occupation, etc. While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results—the results are meant for the pleasure of God. The individual soul is a tiny part of God, and hence our inherent nature is to serve him through all our actions.\n\n**A Sanskrit Quote**\n---------------------\n\n\"God is the Master of the entire creation; all moving and non-moving beings are his servants.\" \n\nMaterial consciousness is characterized by thoughts such as:\n\n*   \"I am the proprietor of all that I possess. It is all meant for my enjoyment. I have the right to enhance my possessions and maximize my enjoyment.\"\n\nSpiritual consciousness, on the other hand, is characterized by thoughts such as:\n\n*   \"God is the owner and enjoyer of this entire world. I am merely his selfless servant. I must use all that I have in the service of God.\"\n\n**Even While Working, Give Up the Pride of Doership**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna wants Arjun to give up kartritwābhimān, or the ego of being the doer. He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions.\n\n**Why We Must Give Up the Ego of Being the Doer**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOur senses, mind, and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our disposal. As a result, only with the help of the power we receive from him, are we able to work. For example, the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves, but they get energized by someone's hand, and then they perform even difficult tasks.\n\n**Do Not Be Attached to Inaction**\n--------------------------------\n\nAlthough the nature of the living being is to work, often situations arise where work seems burdensome and confusing. In such cases, instead of running away from it, we must understand and implement the proper science of work, as explained by Shree Krishna to Arjun. However, it is highly inappropriate if we consider work as laborious and burdensome, and resort to inaction. Becoming attached to inaction is never the solution and is clearly condemned by Shree Krishna.\n\n**A Summary of the Verse**\n---------------------------\n\nAll the above thoughts are very nicely summarized in the following popular Sanskrit verse:\n\n\"Whatever I have achieved and whatever I wish to achieve, I am not the doer of these. O Madhusudan, you are the real doer, and you alone are the enjoyer of their results.\""

    "explanation": "**The Virtue of Equanimity**\n=====================================\n\nThe equanimity that enables us to accept all circumstances with serenity is so praiseworthy that Shree Krishna calls it Yog, or union with the Supreme. This equipoise comes from implementing the knowledge of the previous verse.\n\n### Understanding Effort and Results\n\nWhen we understand that the effort is in our hands, not the results, we then concern ourselves only with doing our duty. The results are for the pleasure of God, and so we dedicate them to him. Now, if the results are not to our expectations, we calmly accept them as the will of God. In this way, we are able to accept fame and infamy, success and failure, pleasure and pain, as God’s will.\n\n### The Practical Solution to Life's Vicissitudes\n\nThe verse is a very practical solution to the vicissitudes of life. If we are sailing in the ocean in a boat, it is natural to expect the waves of the ocean to shake the boat. If we get disturbed each time a wave rocks the boat, our miseries would be endless.\n\n### Accepting the Uncontrollable\n\nAnd if we do not expect the waves to arise, we would be expecting the ocean to become something other than its natural self. Waves are an inseparable phenomenon of the ocean. Similarly, as we wade through the ocean of life, it throws up all kinds of waves that are beyond our control.\n\n### The Importance of Surrender\n\nIf we keep struggling to eliminate negative situations, we will be unable to avoid unhappiness. But if we can learn to accept everything that comes our way, without sacrificing our best efforts, we will have surrendered to the will of God, and that will be true Yog.\n\n### Embracing Both Equally\n\nWhen we learn to embrace both equally, we develop the equanimity that Shree Krishna talks about. In this way, we are able to accept everything that life throws at us, and find inner peace in doing our duty."

    "explanation": "**The Dual Aspects of Work**\n\nWork has two fundamental aspects: our external activity and our internal attitude toward it.\n\n### Example 1\n\nLet us consider an example in which a temple is being built in the holy land of Vrindavan. The workers are engaged in a sacred activity, but their attitude is mundane. They are concerned with the salary they receive and will switch jobs if another contractor offers higher wages.\n\nOn the other hand, there is an ascetic living in Vrindavan who engages in _kār sevā_ (voluntary work) as a service to God. The external work performed by the sadhu and the workers is the same, but the internal attitudes are poles apart.\n\n**Advice from Shree Krishna to Arjun**\n\nShree Krishna advises Arjun to move higher in his internal motivation toward work. He declares that those who work with the motivation of self-enjoyment are miserly, while those who are detached from the fruits and dedicate their work to a higher cause are superior. Those who offer the fruits to God are truly in knowledge.\n\n**Understanding Misery**\n\nThe word _kṛipaṇa_ (miserly) has been used here. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam describes a _kṛipaṇa_ as follows:\n\n> \"A _kṛipaṇa_ is one who thinks that the ultimate reality consists only of sense objects produced from the material energy.\"\n>\n> \"A _kṛipaṇa_ is one who has no control over the senses.\"\n\n### Characteristics of Misery\n\nAs we can see, those who are _kṛipaṇa_ (miserly) have a limited understanding of the ultimate reality. They are controlled by their senses and are driven by a desire for material gains.\n\n**Examples of Misery**\n\nWe can see this character in individuals who are driven by a desire for material wealth and power. They may be successful in their careers, but they are lacking in true fulfillment.\n\n*   Bill Gates, having renounced his position in Microsoft Corporation, now dedicates his energy in the service of society.\n*   Bill Clinton, after having had his fill of power and position as the President of USA, now preaches the glories of service to humankind.\n\n### Perfection of Service\n\nTheir engagement in service is praiseworthy, but it is still imperfectly oriented. That service attitude becomes perfect when we learn to do our works for the pleasure of God, dedicating all the fruits to him.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, work has two fundamental aspects: our external activity and our internal attitude toward it. By understanding this duality, we can move higher in our internal motivation and achieve true fulfillment.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   Work has two fundamental aspects: external activity and internal attitude.\n*   A _kṛipaṇa_ (miserly) is one who thinks that the ultimate reality consists only of sense objects produced from the material energy.\n*   A _kṛipaṇa_ is one who has no control over the senses.\n*   True fulfillment can be achieved by dedicating our works to God and serving others for the pleasure of God."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Attachment-Free Action**\n=============================================\n\nWhen we let go of attachment to results, people often wonder whether our performance will decline. Shree Krishna explains that this is not the case. Working without personal motivation actually makes us more skillful than before.\n\n**The Example of a Sincere Surgeon**\n------------------------------------\n\nConsider the example of a sincere surgeon who cuts people with his knife while operating upon them. He performs his duty with equanimity, and is undisturbed irrespective of whether the patient survives or dies. This is because he is merely doing his duty unselfishly, to the best of his ability, and is not attached to the results. Hence, even if the patient dies while being operated upon, the surgeon does not feel guilty of murder.\n\n**The Attachment Effect**\n------------------------\n\nHowever, if the same surgeon's only child needs to be operated upon, he does not have the courage to do so. Because of attachment to the results, he fears he will not be able to perform the operation skillfully, and so he seeks the help of another surgeon. This shows that attachment to results does not make us more skillful; rather, the attachment affects our performance adversely.\n\n**The Power of Attachment-Free Action**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nInstead, if we work without attachment, we can do so at our maximum skill level, without feeling nervous, jittery, scared, tense, or excited.\n\n**Arjun's Personal Example**\n---------------------------\n\nLikewise, Arjun's personal example also illustrates the point that giving up attachment to the fruits does not adversely affect performance. Before hearing the Bhagavad Gita, he intended to engage in war with the desire of winning a kingdom. After hearing the Bhagavad Gita from Shree Krishna, he was fighting because it was his duty to God, and Shree Krishna would be pleased by it.\n\n**The Change Within Arjun**\n---------------------------\n\nHe was still a warrior; however, his internal motivation had changed. The fact that he did his duty without attachment did not make him any less competent than before. In fact, he fought with greater inspiration because his work was directly in service of God.\n\n**The Key to Skillful Action**\n---------------------------\n\nIn conclusion, giving up attachment to results does not reduce the quality of our work. Instead, it makes us even more skillful than before. By working without attachment, we can achieve our maximum potential and perform with equanimity, regardless of the outcome."

    "explanation": "**The Futility of Seeking Happiness through Material Works**\n====================================================================\n\n2.51 Shree Krishna continues to expound on the topic of working without attachment to the fruits of actions, and states that it leads one to the state beyond suffering. The paradox of life is that we strive for happiness, but reap misery; we crave love, but meet with disappointment; we covet life, but know we are moving toward death at every moment.\n\n**The Conditioning of Misery**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Bhāgavatam states:\n\nsukhāya karmāṇi karoti loko na taiḥ sukhaṁ vānyad-upāramaṁ vā\nvindeta bhūyas tata eva duḥkhaṁ yad atra yuktaṁ bhagavān vaden naḥ\n(v44)\n\n“Every human being engages in fruitive works to get happiness, but finds no satisfaction. Instead, these activities only aggravate the misery.” As a result, practically everyone in this world is unhappy. Some suffer from the miseries of their own body and mind; others are tormented by their family members and relatives; some suffer from scarcity of wealth and the paucity of the necessities of life.\n\n**The Blind Pursuit of Material Growth**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMaterially minded people know they are unhappy, but they think that others ahead of them must be happy, and so they continue running in the direction of material growth. This blind pursuit has been going on for many lifetimes and yet there is no sight of happiness.\n\n**The Path to True Happiness**\n------------------------------\n\nNow, if people could realize that nobody has ever achieved happiness by engaging in fruitive works, they would then understand that the direction in which they are running is futile, and they would think of doing a U-turn toward spiritual life.\n\n**The Power of Spiritual Knowledge**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThose whose intellects have become steadfast with spiritual knowledge understand that God is the Supreme Enjoyer of everything. Consequently, they renounce attachment to the fruits of their actions, offer everything to him, and serenely accept everything that comes as his prasād (mercy). In doing so, their actions become free from karmic reactions that bind one to the cycle of life and death.\n\n**The Liberating Effect of Spiritual Knowledge**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBy understanding this fundamental principle, individuals can break free from the cycle of suffering and misery. They can then embark on a path of spiritual growth, leading to true happiness and fulfillment."

    "explanation": "**The Attachment to Worldly Enjoyments and Vedic Rituals**\n\n2.52 Shree Krishna had previously said that people who are attached to worldly enjoyment get attracted to the flowery words of the Vedas, which propagate ostentatious rituals for gaining worldly opulences and attaining the celestial abodes (verses 2.42–2.43). However, one whose intellect is illumined with spiritual knowledge no longer seeks material sense pleasures, knowing them to be harbingers of misery.\n\n**The Effects of Spiritual Knowledge**\n\nSuch a person then loses interest in Vedic rituals. The Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states:\n\n**\"Realized Sages and Vedic Rituals\"**\n\nparīkṣhya lokānkarmachitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛitaḥ kṛitena \n(1.2.12)[v45]\n\n### Understanding the Temporary Nature of Pleasures\n\n“Realized sages go beyond Vedic rituals, after understanding that the pleasures one attains from fruitive karmas, in this life and in the celestial abodes, are temporary and mixed with misery.”\n\n### The Loss of Interest in Vedic Rituals\n\nThis quote highlights the importance of understanding the temporary nature of worldly pleasures. When one's intellect is illuminated with spiritual knowledge, they lose interest in Vedic rituals and the attachment to material sense pleasures. This realization leads to a deeper understanding of the true nature of existence and the fleeting nature of worldly pleasures."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Significance of Spiritual Growth**\n=====================================================\n\nAs individuals advance on the spiritual path, their relationship with God becomes stronger. They begin to see the Vedic rituals they were previously performing as cumbersome and time-consuming. This leads them to wonder whether they are obligated to continue with these rituals, alongside their devotion.\n\n**The Doubt and Its Resolution**\n-------------------------------\n\nSuch individuals will find the answer to their doubt in this verse. Shree Krishna states that to be fixed in spiritual growth without being allured to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offense. Rather, it is a higher spiritual state.\n\n**The Sage's Perspective**\n-------------------------\n\nMadhavendra Puri, the famous 14th-century sage, emphasizes this sentiment very emphatically. A Vedic Brahmin and ritualistic practitioner himself, he took to the renounced order (sanyās) and dedicated himself fully to devotion. In his later life, he wrote:\n\n\"sandhyā vandana bhadramastu bhavate bhoḥ snāna tubhyaṁ namaḥ\nbho devāḥ pitaraśhchatarapaṇa vidhau nahaṁ kṣhamaḥ kṣhamyatām\nyatra kvāpi niṣhadya yādava kulottaasya kansadviṣhaḥ\nsmāraṁ smāramaghaṁ harāmi tadalaṁ manye kimanyena me \n[v46]\"\n\n\"I wish to apologize to all kinds of rituals as I have no time to respect them.

Now, wherever I sit, I remember the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, the enemy of Kansa, and that is sufficient to release me from material bondage.\"\n\n**Shree Krishna's Explanation**\n---------------------------\n\nShree Krishna uses the word \nsamādhāv-achalā\n in this verse to refer to the state of steadfastness in divine consciousness. The word \nSamādhi\n has been formed from the roots \nsam\n (equilibrium) and \ndhi\n (intellect), meaning, “a state of total equilibrium of the intellect.” One who is steadfast in the higher consciousness, unmoved by material allurements attains that state of \nSamādhi\n, or perfect Yog.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n-----------------\n\n*   Spiritual growth leads to a stronger relationship with God\n*   The Vedic rituals may become cumbersome and time-consuming as one advances on the spiritual path\n*   To be fixed in spiritual growth without being allured to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offense, but a higher spiritual state\n*   The state of steadfastness in divine consciousness is referred to as \nsamādhāv-achalā\n and attained through perfect Yog"

In this section, we will delve into the 16 questions posed by Arjun to Lord Krishna, seeking enlightenment on various aspects of yoga and spirituality.\n\n**The Sixteen Questions**\n\nArjun's questions to Krishna span multiple topics, including yoga, karma, devotion, and the nature of reality. Here are the questions with brief explanations:\n\n### **The Nature of the Mind**\n\n1. \"What is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness?\" (verse 2.54)\nKrishna's response highlights the importance of steady intellect and trance in achieving enlightenment.\n\n### **Karmic Actions**\n\n2. \"If you consider knowledge superior to fruitive works, then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war?\" (verse 3.1)\nThis question addresses the relative importance of knowledge and action in achieving spiritual growth.\n\n### **The Nature of Sin**\n\n3. \"Why is a person impelled to commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force?\" (verse 3.36)\nKrishna's explanation reveals the complexity of human nature and the power of karma.\n\n### **The Origins of Knowledge**\n\n4. \"You were born much after Vivasvan. How am I to understand that in the beginning you instructed this science to him?\" (verse 4.4)\nThis question highlights the debate between knowledge and action, with Krishna clarifying his role as a teacher.\n\n### **The Benefits of Yoga**\n\n5. \"You praised the path of renunciation of actions, and again you praised work with devotion. Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial?\" (verse 5.1)\nKrishna responds by emphasizing the importance of devotion and the role of yoga in achieving spiritual growth.\n\n### **The Challenges of Yoga**\n\n6. \"O Krishna, the mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind.\" (verse 6.34)\nKrishna acknowledges the challenges of yoga and offers guidance on how to overcome them.\n\n### **The Fate of Unsuccessful Yogis**\n\n7. \"What is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but whose mind deviates from God due to untamed passions, and is unable to reach the highest perfection in this life?\" (verse 6.37)\nKrishna's response provides insight into the consequences of failure in yoga and the importance of maintaining faith.\n\n### **The Nature of Brahman**\n\n8. \"What is Brahma and what is karma? What is Adhibhūta, and who are the Ādhidaiva? Who is Ādhiyajña and how does he dwell in this body?\" (verse 8.1-2)\nThis question explores the nature of Brahman, karma, and other fundamental concepts.\n\n### **The Cosmic Form**\n\n9. \"Please describe to me your divine opulences, by which you pervade all the worlds.\" (verse 10.16)\nKrishna's response reveals the divine nature of his cosmic form.\n\n### **The Cosmic Form**\n\n10. \"I long to see your cosmic form, O Supreme divine Personality.\" (verse 11.3)\nArjun's desire to see the cosmic form highlights his devotion and curiosity.\n\n### **The Nature of Time**\n\n11. \"You, who existed before all creation, I wish to know who you are, for your nature and workings mystify me.\" (verse 11.31)\nKrishna's response clarifies his role as the creator and sustainer of time.\n\n### **The Nature of Devotion**\n\n12. \"Between those who are steadfastly devoted to your personal form and those who worship the formless Brahma, whom do you consider to be more perfect in Yog?\" (verse 12.1)\nKrishna responds by emphasizing the importance of devotion and personal connection with God.\n\n### **The Nature of Reality**\n\n13. \"I wish to know about Prakṛiti (Nature) and Puruśh (the enjoyer). What is the field of activities, and who is the knower of the field? What is the nature of knowledge, and the object of knowledge?\" (verse 13.1)\nKrishna's explanation reveals the complexity of nature, the self, and reality.\n\n### **The Nature of Knowledge**\n\n14. \"What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the bondage of the guṇas?\" (verse 14.21)\nKrishna's response highlights the characteristics of those who have transcended the three guṇas (qualities).\n\n### **The Nature of Injunctions**\n\n15. \"Where do they stand who disregard the injunctions of the scriptures, but still worship with faith?\" (verse 17.1)\nKrishna's response emphasizes the importance of following injunctions and maintaining faith.\n\n### **The Nature of Renunciation**\n\n16. \"I wish to understand the nature of sanyās (renunciation), and how it is distinct from tyāg, or renouncing the fruits of actions.\" (verse 18.1)\nKrishna's explanation reveals the distinction between renunciation and the pursuit of material rewards.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nArjun's 16 questions to Krishna represent a comprehensive inquiry into the nature of reality, the self, and spiritual growth. Through these questions, we gain insight into the complexities of yoga, devotion, and the ultimate truth."

    "explanation": "**The Essence of Chapter 2: Shree Krishna's Discourse on Divine Love**\n\nShree Krishna begins answering Arjun’s questions here, and continues till the end of the chapter. Each fragment is naturally drawn towards its whole; just as a piece of stone is drawn by the force of gravitation towards the earth. The individual soul is a fragment of God, who is infinite bliss. Hence, the soul is a fragment of the ocean of infinite bliss, and it experiences the natural urge for bliss.\n\n**The Concept of Divine Love**\n\nWhen it strives to relish the bliss of the soul from God, it is called “Divine Love.” But when, in ignorance of its spiritual nature, it thinks of itself as the body, and seeks to relish the bliss of the body from the world, it is called “lust.”\n\n**The Illusion of Material Pleasures**\n\nThis world has been called \nmṛiga tṛiṣhṇā\n in the scriptures, meaning “like the mirage seen by the deer.” The sun rays reflecting on the hot desert sand create an illusion of water for the deer. It thinks there is water ahead of it and runs to quench its thirst. But the more it runs toward the water, the more the mirage fades away. Its dull intellect cannot recognize that it is running after an illusion.\n\n**The Futility of Chasing Illusions**\n\nSimilarly, the material energy Maya too creates an illusion of happiness, and we run after that illusory happiness in the hope of quenching the thirst of our senses. But no matter how much we try, happiness keeps fading further away from us.\n\n**The Nature of the Soul's Thirst**\n\nA person who desires the world and its pleasures is like a deer chasing an illusion. The Garuḍ Purāṇ states:\n\nchakradharo ’pi suratvaṁ suratvalābhe sakalasurapatitvam\nbhavtirum surapatirūrdhvagatitvaṁ tathāpi nanivartate tṛiṣhṇā\n (2.12.14) [v47]\n“A king wishes to be the emperor of the whole world; the emperor aspires to be a celestial god; a celestial god seeks to be Indra, the king of heaven; and Indra desires to be Brahma, the secondary creator. Yet the thirst for material enjoyment does not get satiated.”\n\n**The Reality of Spiritual Aspirations**\n\nBut when one learns to turn the mind away from material allurements and renounces the desires of the senses, such a person comes in touch with the inner bliss of the soul and becomes transcendentally situated. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad goes to the extent of saying that one who has renounced desires becomes like God:\n\nyadā sarve pramuchyante kāmā ye ’sya hṛidi śhritaḥ\natha martyo ’mṛito bhavatyatra brahma samaśhnute (2.3.14)\n[v48]\n“When one eliminates all selfish desires from the heart, then the materially fettered \njīvātmā\n (soul) attains freedom from birth and death, and becomes Godlike in virtue.”\n\n**The Essence of Transcendental Existence**\n\nShree Krishna states in the above verse that a transcendentally situated person is one who has given up selfish desires and cravings of the senses, and is satisfied in the self."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Concept of Sage of Steady Wisdom**\n======================================================\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna describes sages of steady wisdom as:\n\n### Characteristics of a Sage\n\n*   **Vīta rāga** (free from craving for pleasure)\n*   **Vīta bhaya** (free from fear)\n*   **Vīta krodha** (devoid of anger)\n\nAn enlightened person does not allow the mind to harbor the material frailties of lust, anger, greed, envy, etc. Only then can the mind steadily contemplate on transcendence and be fixed in the divine.\n\n### The Process of Torture\n\nIf one permits the mind to brood over miseries, then the contemplation on the divine ceases and the mind is dragged down from the transcendental level. The process of torture works in the same manner.\n\nMore than the present pain itself, it is the memories of past pain and apprehensions of future pain that torment the mind. But when the mind drops these two and has to simply grope with the present sensation, the pain surprisingly shrinks to a manageable (within the limits of tolerance) size.\n\n### Historical Example\n\nIt is well known that historically Buddhist monks adopted a similar technique for tolerating torture from invading conquerors.\n\n### The Role of the Mind\n\nSimilarly, if the mind craves external pleasures, it runs to the objects of enjoyment, and is again diverted from divine contemplation. So a sage of steady wisdom is one who does not allow the mind to hanker for pleasure or lament for miseries.\n\n### Perpetuating Anger and Fear\n\nFurther, such a sage does not permit the mind to succumb to the urges of fear and anger. In this way, the mind becomes situated on the transcendental level.\n\n### The State of Transcendence\n\nThe contemplation on the divine ceases, and the mind is fixed in the transcendental state. This is achieved by dropping the attachments to material desires, past pain, and future fears.\n\n### The Mind's Attitude\n\nOnly when the mind is free from these attachments can it steadily contemplate on transcendence. The process of torture, or any form of suffering, cannot drag the mind down from this state; it can only make it more resilient.\n\n### Mindfulness and Awareness\n\nA sage of steady wisdom understands the power of mindfulness and awareness. They recognize that these qualities are essential for maintaining a peaceful and detached state, even in the face of adversity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a sage of steady wisdom is one who has achieved a state of freedom from the material frailties of lust, anger, greed, envy, etc. They are able to maintain their peace and detachment in the face of adversity, and can steadily contemplate on transcendence."

    "explanation": "**The Essence of \"Sthita Prajña\"**\n=====================================\n\nRudyard Kipling, a famous British poet, has encapsulated the essence of this verse on \"Sthita Prajña\" (Sage of steady intelligence) in his famous poem “If.” Here are a few lines from the poem:\n\n### Key Principles of \"Sthita Prajña\"\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\n*   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,\n*   If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n    And treat those two impostors just the same…\n*   If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n*   If all men count with you, but none too much:\n\n### Filling the Unforgiving Minute\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\n\n### The State of Enlightenment\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!\n\n**The Shared Human Desire**\n==========================\n\nThe popularity of this poem shows the natural urge in people to reach the state of enlightenment, which Shree Krishna describes to Arjun. One may wonder how an English poet expressed the same state of enlightenment that is described by the Supreme Lord. The fact is that the urge for enlightenment is the intrinsic nature of the soul. Hence, knowingly or unknowingly, everyone craves for it, in all cultures around the world.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Response**\n=========================\n\nShree Krishna is describing it here, in response to Arjun’s question. This verse provides a glimpse into the universal desire for self-realization and spiritual growth, transcending cultural and linguistic boundaries."

    "explanation": "### The Futility of Fulfilling Desires\n#### A Verse from the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam\n\n2.58 Attempting to quench the cravings of the senses by supplying them with their desired objects is like trying to dowse a fire by pouring clarified butter on it. The fire may be smothered for a moment, but then it flares up with redoubled intensity. Hence, the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states that desires never go away when they are fulfilled; they only come back more strongly:\n\nna jātu kāmaḥ kāmānām upabhogena śhāmyati\nhaviṣhā kṛiṣhṇa-vartmeva bhūya evābhivardhate \n(9.19.14) [v49]\n\n**Fulfilling Desires Does Not Extinguish Them**\n>\"Fulfilling the desires of the senses does not extinguish them, just as offering oblations of butter in the fire does not extinguish it; instead, it makes the fire blaze even stronger.\" \n\nThese desires can be compared to an itch in the body. The itch is troublesome and creates an irresistible urge to scratch. But scratching does not solve the problem. For a few moments, there is relief, and then the itch returns with greater force. Instead, if someone can tolerate the itch for some time, it begins losing its sting, and dies down slowly. That is the secret for getting peace from the itch.\n\n### The Same Logic Applies to Desires\nThe mind and senses throw up myriad desires for happiness, but as long as we are in the game of fulfilling them, happiness remains illusory, like a mirage. But when we learn to discard all these desires, to find happiness in God, the mind and senses make peace with us.\n\n### The Power of Discernment\nSo an enlightened sage intelligently masters the senses and the mind. The illustration used in this verse is that of the turtle. Whenever it encounters danger, the turtle protects itself by drawing its limbs and head inside its shell. After the danger passes, the turtle again extracts its limbs and head and continues on its way.\n\n**Retracting and Extracting the Mind and Senses**\nThe enlightened soul possesses similar control over the mind and senses and can retract and extract them according to the needs of the situation. This control enables us to experience peace and happiness, unshaken by external events or influences."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Desire**\n==========================\n\nWhen one gives up eating, as in a fast, the desires of the senses become feeble. Similarly, in sickness one loses interest toward the objects of enjoyment. These states of dispassion are temporary, for the seed of desire remains within the mind.\n\n### The Seed of Desire\n\nWhat is this seed of desire? It is the intrinsic nature of the soul for the divine bliss of God, of whom it is a tiny fragment. Until it gets that divine bliss, the soul can never be contented, and the search for happiness will continue.\n\n### Temporary Restrainment\n\nSpiritual aspirants (Sādhaks) may forcibly restrain their senses with their will power, but such restraint is temporary because it does not extinguish the internal flame of desire. However, when the soul engages in devotion toward God, and gets divine bliss, it experiences the higher taste for which it had been craving since infinite lifetimes.\n\n**The Taittirīya Upaniṣad**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Taittirīya Upaniṣad states:\n\n```rāsa vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā ʼnandī bhavati\n```\n\n\"God is all-bliss. When the soul attains God, it becomes satiated in bliss.\" Then, one naturally develops dispassion toward the lower sensual pleasures. This detachment that comes through devotion is firm and unshakeable.\n\n**The Path of Sublimation**\n---------------------------\n\nThus, the Bhagavad Gita does not teach a dry suppression of desires, instead it teaches the beautiful path of sublimation of desires by directing them toward God.\n\n### The Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n\nThe Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa expressed this principle very eloquently, when he said:\n\n\"Devotion is love for the highest; and the lowest shall fall away by itself.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n==============\n\nIn conclusion, the seed of desire is an intrinsic nature of the soul that longs for divine bliss. While temporary restraint may be possible, it does not extinguish the flame of desire. Instead, devotion toward God leads to a higher taste and firm detachment from lower sensual pleasures."

    "explanation": "**The Senses: A Challenge to Spiritual Growth**\n=====================================================\n\n**The Wild Nature of the Senses**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe senses are like wild horses that have been newly harnessed. They are impetuous and reckless, and hence, disciplining them is an important battle that sādhaks have to fight within themselves. Therefore, those desirous of spiritual growth should carefully strive to tame the indulgent senses, which are colored with lust and greed, or else they have the power to sabotage and derail the spiritual process of even the most well-intentioned yogis.\n\n**A Story from the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere is a story in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam that perfectly illustrates this statement (canto 9, chapter 6). The story revolves around a great sage named Saubhari. He is mentioned in the Rig Veda, where there is a mantra called Saubhari Sutra. There is also a scripture called the Saubhari Samhita, indicating that he was not just an ordinary sage.\n\n**Saubhari's Achievements**\n-------------------------\n\nSaubhari had attained such control over his body that he used to submerge himself in the river Yamuna and meditate under water. His ability to control his body was so great that he could even submerge himself in the water and meditate. One day, while meditating under water, he saw two fish mating. This sight carried away his mind and senses, and the desire for sexual association arose in him.\n\n**A Plea to King Mandhata**\n-------------------------\n\nSaubhari approached the king of Ayodhya, Mandhata, and asked for the hand of one of the fifty princesses. The king was in a dilemma as he knew that Saubhari was a powerful sage, and refusing his request might incur a curse. On the other hand, consenting to the request might ruin the life of one of his daughters.\n\n**The King's Plan**\n-----------------\n\nTo avoid this situation, the king thought to himself, \"An old man wanting to get married!\" In this way, he could save himself from the sage's curse. However, Saubhari was aware of the king's intention and told him that he would return the following day.\n\n**Saubhari's Cunning Plan**\n-------------------------\n\nThat evening, Saubhari used his yogic powers to turn himself into a handsome young man. The next day, when he presented himself at the palace, all the fifty princesses chose him as their husband. The king was bound by his word and was compelled to marry all his daughters to the sage.\n\n**The Consequences of Saubhari's Actions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs time passed, the king was concerned about the fights that would take place amongst the fifty sisters. To avoid this situation, Saubhari used his yogic powers again and created fifty palaces for his wives. In this manner, thousands of years passed by.\n\n**The Puranas' Account**\n-------------------------\n\nAccording to the Puranas, Saubhari had many children from each of his wives. Those children had further children, until a tiny city had been created.\n\n**Saubhari's Realization**\n-------------------------\n\nAfter thousands of years, Saubhari came to his senses and exclaimed:\n\n\"O humans! Those of you, who make plans to attain happiness through material acquisitions, be careful. Look at my degradation—where I was and where am I now. I created fifty bodies by my yogic powers, and lived with fifty women for thousands of years. And yet, the senses did not experience fulfillment; they only kept hankering for more. Learn from my downfall and be warned not to venture in this direction.\"\n\n**A Message to Humanity**\n---------------------------\n\nThis story serves as a warning to those who are seeking spiritual growth. The senses are like wild horses that need to be harnessed and disciplined. Those who fail to do so may find themselves on a path of destruction, just like Saubhari."

    "explanation": "**The Vedic Understanding of Mental Diseases**\n=====================================================\n\nIn the Vedic scriptures, Anger, Greed, Lust, etc. are considered as **mānas rog**, or diseases of the mind.\n\n### The Diseases of the Mind\n\nWe are all aware of the diseases of the body—even a single bodily ailment has the power to make one’s whole day miserable—but we do not realize that we are being continuously tormented by multiple mental ailments.\n\nAnd since we do not recognize lust, anger, greed, etc. as mental diseases, we do not try to cure them.\n\n**Psychology: A Branch of Human Knowledge**\n------------------------------------------\n\nPsychology is a branch of human knowledge that attempts to analyze these ailments and propose solutions to them.\n\nHowever, both the analysis and the solution presented by western psychology leave much to be desired, and appear to be gross approximations of the reality of the mind.\n\n### Attachment as the First Mental Disease\n\nIn this and the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna has given perfect and penetrating insight into functioning of the mind.\n\nHe explains that when we repeatedly contemplate that there is happiness in some object, the mind becomes attached to it.\n\n**The Example of a Class**\n\nFor example, in a class there are a number of boys and girls, and they interact innocuously with each other.\n\nOne day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, “I would be very happy if she were mine.”\n\nAs he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her.\n\n**The Consequences of Attachment**\n\nHe tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her.\n\nHis friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her.\n\nWhy is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her?\n\n**The Chain of Mental Diseases**\n\nThe fact is that he repeatedly thought that there was happiness in the girl, and so his mind became attached to her.\n\nNow attachment seems quite innocuous by itself.\n\nBut the problem is that from attachment comes desire. If one is attached to drinks, the desire for drinks comes repeatedly to the mind.\n\nIf one is attached to cigarettes, then thoughts of the pleasure of smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow in the mind, creating a craving for them.\n\n**The Second Mental Disease: Desire**\n\nIn this way, attachment leads to desire.\n\nOnce desire develops, it gives birth to two more problems—greed and anger.\n\n**Greed: The Fulfillment of Desire**\n\nGreed comes from the fulfillment of desire.\n\n**The Ramayan and the Bhagavatam**\n\nJimi pratilābha lobha adhikāī (Ramayan) [v54] “If you satisfy desire, it leads to greed.”\n\nThus desire is never eliminated by satiating it:\n\nyat pṛithivyāṁ vrīhi-yavaṁ hiraṇyaṁ paśhavaḥ striyaḥ\nna duhyanti manaḥ-prītiṁ puṅsaḥ kāma-hatasya te (Bhāgavatam 9.19.13) [v55]\n\n“If one person were to get all the wealth, luxuries, and sensual objects in the world, that person’s desire would still not be satiated.\n\nHence, knowing it to be the cause of misery, an intelligent person should renounce desire.”\n\n**The Consequences of Unfulfilled Desire**\n\nOn the flip side what happens if the fulfillment of desire is obstructed? It gives rise to anger.\n\nBear in mind that anger does not arise by itself. It is created from the obstruction of desire; and desire arises from attachment, while attachment comes from contemplation of the sense objects.\n\n**The Chain of Mental Diseases**\n\nIn this manner, we see how the simple act of contemplating the pleasures of sense objects leads downward to the twin diseases of greed and anger."

    "explanation": "**The Impact of Anger on Judgment**\n\nAnger impairs judgment, just as the morning mist creates a hazy covering on the sunlight. In anger, people commit mistakes that they later regret, because the intellect gets clouded by the haze of emotions.\n\n### A Personal Reflection\n\nPeople say, “He is twenty years elder to me. Why did I speak in this manner to him? What happened to me?”\n\n### The Consequences of Anger\n\nWhat happened was that the faculty of judgment was affected by anger, and hence the mistake of scolding an elder was made.\n\n**The Effects on Memory**\n\nWhen the intellect is clouded, it leads to bewilderment of memory. The person then forgets what is right and what is wrong, and flows along with the surge of emotions.\n\n### The Downward Descent\n\nThe downward descent continues from there, and bewilderment of memory results in destruction of the intellect.\n\n**The Importance of Preserving Intellect**\n\nAnd since the intellect is the internal guide, when it gets destroyed, one is ruined.\n\n**The Path of Descent**\n\nIn this manner, the path of descent from divinity to impiety has been described beginning with contemplation on the sense objects to the destruction of the intellect."

    "explanation": "**The Natural Urge for Happiness**\n\n2.64\nThe entire downward spiral leading to ruin begins with contemplating happiness in sense objects. Now, the urge for happiness is as natural to the soul as thirst is to the physical body. It is impossible to think \"I will not contemplate happiness anywhere,\" because it is unnatural for the soul.\n\n**The Simple Solution**\n\nThe simple solution then is to envision happiness in the proper direction, i.e. in God. If we can repeatedly revise the thought that happiness is in God, we will develop attachment toward him. This divine attachment will not degrade the mind like material attachment; rather, it will purify it.\n\n**The Purifying Power of Devotion**\n\nGod is all-pure, and when we attach our mind to him, the mind will also become pure. This is in contrast to material attachment and desire, which can lead to degradation of the mind.\n\n**Spiritual Attachment is Not Bad**\n\nThus, whenever Shree Krishna asks us to give up attachment and desire, he is referring only to material attachment and desire. Spiritual attachment and desire are not to be given up; in fact, they are most praiseworthy. They are to be cultivated and increased for purification of the mind.\n\n**The Greater the Desire, the Purer the Mind**\n\nThe greater the burning desire we develop for God, the purer our mind will become. The jñānīs who propound the worship of the undifferentiated attributeless Brahman do not understand this point when they recommend giving up all attachments.\n\n**Contradiction in the Teachings of Krishna**\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna states: \"Those who attach their minds to me with unadulterated devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and attain the level of the supreme Brahman.\" (Bhagavad Gita 14.26)\n\n**Contradiction in the Teachings of Krishna (continued)**\n\nHe repeatedly urges Arjun to attach his mind to God in many verses ahead, such as 8.7, 8.14, 9.22, 9.34, 10.10, 12.8, 11.54, 18.55, 18.58, 18.65, etc.\n\n**The Coin of Attachment and Aversion**\n\nAttachment and aversion are two sides of the same coin. Aversion is nothing but negative attachment. Just as, in attachment, the object of attachment repeatedly comes to one’s mind; similarly, in aversion, the object of hatred keeps popping into the mind.\n\n**The Same Effect**\n\nSo attachment and aversion to material objects both have the same effect on the mind—they dirty it and pull it into the three modes of material nature. When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss.\n\n**The Mind Free from Attachment and Aversion**\n\nOn experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them. Thus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita prajña is free from both attachment and aversion."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Grace**\n==========================\n\n**What is Grace?**\n-----------------\n\nGrace is like a divine energy that floods into a person’s personality. By grace, God who is sat-chit-ānand\nbestows his divine knowledge, divine love, and divine bliss. This entrenches the intellect, like the North Star, in the love, bliss, and knowledge of God.\n\n**The Effects of Grace**\n-----------------------\n\nBy God’s grace, when we experience the higher taste of divine bliss, the agitation for sensual happiness is extinguished. Once that hankering for material objects ceases, one goes beyond all suffering and the mind becomes tranquil.\n\n**The Intellect's Transformation**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn that state of internal fulfillment, the intellect becomes firm in its decision that God alone is the source of happiness and is the final goal of the soul. Previously, the intellect was accepting this only on the basis of knowledge as stated in the scriptures, but now it gets the experience of perfect peace and divine bliss.\n\n**The Intellect's Conviction**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis convinces the intellect beyond any shadow of doubt, and it becomes steadily situated in God."

Previously, Shree Krishna said “Know God; know peace.” In this verse, he says “No God; no peace.” A person who has not learnt to discipline the mind and senses can neither meditate upon God nor experience his divine bliss.\n\n**The Consequences of Not Disciplining the Senses**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nWithout the higher taste, it becomes impossible to renounce the lower taste, and such a person keeps hankering for material happiness, like the bee finds it impossible to renounce the nectar of the flower:\n\n*   The bee remains attached to the flower, refusing to fly away as it thinks there is still time for it to close.\n*   It continues to indulge in the nectar, thinking that tomorrow morning the flower will open again.\n\n### The Story of the Bee\n-----------------------------\n\nThis popular verse in Sanskrit literature relates a bee's story. The bee was sitting on a lotus flower, drinking its nectar. As the sun began setting, the petals of the flower began shutting. But the bee was so attached to enjoying the object of its senses that it refused to fly off.\n\n**The Parable of the Bee**\n-------------------------\n\nIn the same way, we can see old age coming as a sure sign of death, but like the bee, we remain engrossed in enjoying worldly pleasures.\n\n*   It thought, “There is still time for the flower to close. Let me suck some more nectar while I can.”\n*   It became dark and the lotus flower closed, trapping the bee.\n*   The bee thought, “Never mind! Let me remain inside my beloved flower for tonight. Tomorrow morning, when its petals open again, I will fly away.”\n\n### The Lesson of the Bee\n-------------------------\n\n“A bee has the power to cut through wood. But look at the attachment to the sense objects that the bee which can cut through wood is stuck inside the soft petals of the lotus.” \n\nIn the meantime, an elephant came, broke the lotus from the stem, and swallowed it. The bee along with the lotus went into the stomach of the elephant. The bee was thinking, “My beloved lotus is going somewhere, and I am happily going along with it.” It died shortly thereafter.\n\n**The Human Condition**\n------------------------\n\nSimilarly, we humans too remain engrossed in the gratification of the senses, and do not heed to the message of the Saints to engage in devotion to God. Finally, time overtakes us in the form of death.\n\n### The Three-Fold Miseries of Maya\n--------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna says that those who refuse to discipline the senses and engage in devotion continue to be rocked by the three-fold miseries of Maya. Material desires are like an itching eczema, and the more we indulge in them, the worse they become.\n\n*   How can we be truly happy in this state of material indulgence?"

The weakness of elephants is the sense of touch. The hunter uses this to trap the male elephant by using the female elephant as bait to draw it into the pit.

    "explanation": "**The Cycle of Intellect, Mind, and Senses**\n\nIn the context of spiritual growth, enlightened souls exert control over their intellect through transcendental knowledge. This purified intellect is then utilized to regulate the mind, which in turn helps to curb the influence of the senses.\n\nHowever, in a state conditioned by material attachments, the cycle reverses. The senses exert pressure on the mind, causing it to override the intellect's guidance. As a result, the intellect loses its direction and becomes derailed from the path of true welfare.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Perspective**\n\nAccording to Shree Krishna, this cycle can be reversed by purifying the intellect with spiritual knowledge.

He had not slept in thirty-five years. He would stand in his room, resting on a hanging rope under his armpits. He used the rope to help him remain in the standing position.\n\n**His Motivation**\n\nOn being asked what his motivation was for this destructive kind of austerity, he would quote this verse of the Bhagavad Gita:\n\n> \"What all beings see as night, the enlightened sage sees as day.\"\n\n**A Misunderstanding?**\n\nSo to practice it, he had given up sleeping at night. What a misunderstanding of the verse! From all that standing, his feet and lower legs were swollen, and so he could practically do nothing except stand.\n\n**Let Us Understand the True Meaning**\n\nThose who are in mundane consciousness look to material enjoyment as the real purpose of life. They consider the opportunity for worldly pleasures as the success of life, or \"day,\" and deprivation from sense pleasures as darkness, or \"night.\"\n\n**The Contrast**\n\nOn the other hand, those who have become wise with divine knowledge, see sense enjoyment as harmful for the soul, and hence view it as \"night.\" They consider refraining from the objects of the senses as elevating to the soul, and hence look on it as \"day.\"\n\n**The Paradox**\n\nUsing those connotations of the words, Shree Krishna states that what is night for the sage is day for the worldly-minded people, and vice versa.\n\n**A Key to Understanding**\n\nBy understanding this paradox, we can gain a deeper insight into the true nature of reality and our place in it. It is only by recognizing this distinction that we can truly begin to see the world in a new light."

All the rivers of the world constantly empty themselves into the oceans, which neither overflow nor get depleted.\n\n**The Power of Non-Action**\n---------------------------\n\nShree Krishna uses the word `āpūryamāṇaṁ` (filled from all sides) to describe that even the rivers pouring all their water during the rainy season into the ocean cannot make it flow over. This illustrates the concept of non-action (or **ācarya vairagya**), where a realized individual remains quiescent and unmoved in both conditions:\n\n### Two Conditions for a Realized Sage\n\n*   While utilizing sense objects for bodily necessities\n*   Being bereft of them\n\n### The Significance of Non-Action\n----------------------------------\n\nOnly such a sage who has transcended the cycles of birth and death can attain **Śhānti**, or true peace."

Either way, we get trapped. So the path to inner peace does not lie in fulfilling desires, but instead in eliminating them.\n\n*   **A Waste of Time**: Greed for material advancement is a great waste of time.\n*   **An Endless Chase**: It is an endless chase. In developed countries, very few people are deprived of enough to eat and wear, and yet they remain disturbed; this is because their hankering is still unsatisfied.\n*   **True Wealth**: Thus, those who possess the wealth of contentment possess one of the biggest treasures of life.\n\n### Greed\n------\n\nGreed is a significant obstacle to inner peace. \n\n*   **A Never-Ending Cycle**: Greed for material advancement is a never-ending cycle that consumes our lives.\n*   **Unsatisfaction**: In developed countries, very few people are deprived of enough to eat and wear, and yet they remain disturbed; this is because their hankering is still unsatisfied.\n*   **The Treasure of Contentment**: Those who possess the wealth of contentment possess one of the biggest treasures of life.\n\n### Ego\n-----\n\nMost of the quarrels that erupt between people stem from the ego. Mark H McCormack, author of What They Don’t Teach You At Harvard Business School writes: “Most corporate executives are one giant ego, with a couple of arms and legs sticking out.”\n\n*   **A Source of Conflict**: The ego is a source of conflict in relationships.\n*   **Statistics Reveal**: Statistics reveal that a majority of executives, who lose their jobs in the senior management level, do so not because of professional incompetence, but because of interpersonal issues.\n*   **The Way to Peace**: The way to peace is not to nurture and increase pride, but to get rid of it.\n\n### Proprietorship\n-----------------\n\nThe feeling of proprietorship is based upon ignorance because the whole world belongs to God. We came empty-handed in the world, and we will go back empty-handed. How then can we think of worldly things as ours?\n\n*   **A Sense of Ownership**: The feeling of proprietorship is a sense of ownership, which is based upon ignorance.\n*   **The Whole World Belongs to God**: The whole world belongs to God, and we came empty-handed in the world.\n*   **A Humbling Reality**: We will go back empty-handed, and this is a humbling reality that we must accept."

When the soul purifies the heart (the mind and intellect are sometimes jointly referred to as the heart), God bestows his divine grace, as mentioned in verse 2.64.\n\n**The Gifts of Divine Grace**\n---------------------------\n\nBy his grace, he grants divine knowledge, divine bliss, and divine love to the soul. All these are divine energies that are given by God to the soul at the time of God-realization.\n\n**Liberation from Maya's Bondage**\n----------------------------------\n\nAt the same time, he liberates the soul from the bondage of Maya. The sañchit karmas (account of karmas of endless lifetimes) are destroyed. The avidyā, ignorance within, from endless lifetimes in the material world, is dispelled.\n\n**The End of Material Influences**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe influence of tri-guṇas, three modes of material nature, ceases. The tri-doṣhas, three defects of the materially conditioned state come to an end. The pañch-kleśhas, five defects of the material intellect, are destroyed.\n\n**The Destruction of Material Sheaths**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe pañch-kośhas, five sheaths of the material energy, are burnt. And from that point onward, the soul becomes free from the bondage of Maya for the rest of eternity.\n\n**The State of Liberation**\n---------------------------\n\nWhen this state of God-realization is achieved, the soul is said to be jīvan mukt, or liberated even while residing in the body.\n\n**The Afterlife**\n-----------------\n\nThen, at the time of death, the liberated soul finally discards the corporeal body, and it reaches the Supreme Abode of God.\n\n**Rig Veda's Perspective**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Rig Veda states:\n```latex\ntadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśhyanti sūrayaḥ \n(1.22.20) [v60]\n```\n\"Once the soul attains God, it always remains in union with him. After that, the ignorance of Maya can never overpower it again.\"\n\n**The Concept of Nirvāṇa and Mokṣha**\n------------------------------------\n\nThat state of eternal liberation from Maya is also called nirvāṇa and mokṣha.

The first is the acquisition of knowledge through the analytical study of the nature of the soul and its distinction from the body. Shree Krishna refers to this as **sāṅkhya yog**.\n\nPeople with a philosophic bend of mind are inclined toward this path of knowing the self through intellectual analysis.\n\n### Working in the Spirit of Devotion (Karma Yoga)\n\nThe second path is the process of working in the spirit of devotion to God, or **karma yog**. Shree Krishna also calls this **buddhi yog**, as explained in the previous verse.\n\nWorking in this manner purifies the mind, and knowledge naturally awakens in the purified mind, thus leading to enlightenment.\n\n### The Two Paths: Contemplation and Action\n\nAmongst people interested in the spiritual path, there are those who are inclined toward contemplation and then there are those inclined to action.\n\n*   **Contemplative Path**: Those who are inclined towards contemplation are drawn to the path of introspection and self-reflection.\n*   **Action-Oriented Path**: On the other hand, those inclined towards action are driven by a desire to serve and contribute to the world around them.\n\n### Embracing Both Paths\n\nHence, both these paths have existed ever since the soul's aspiration for God-realization has existed.

In this explanation, we will delve into the subtleties of these two paths.\n\n**Karm Yog: The Discipline of Work**\n\nThe first line of this verse refers to the karm yogi (follower of the discipline of work), and the second line refers to the sanikhya yogi (follower of the discipline of knowledge).\n\n*   **Karm Yog: Freedom from Karmic Reactions**\n    In the first line, Shree Krishna says that mere abstinence from work does not result in a state of freedom from karmic reactions. The mind continues to engage in fruitive thoughts, and since mental work is also a form of karma, it binds one in karmic reactions, just as physical work does.\n    *   A true karm yogi must learn to work without any attachment to the fruits of actions.\n    *   This requires cultivation of knowledge in the intellect. Hence, philosophic knowledge is also necessary for success in karm yog.\n*   **Sanikhya Yog: The Discipline of Knowledge**\n    In the second line, Shree Krishna declares that the sanikhya yogi cannot attain the state of knowledge merely by renouncing the world and becoming a monk.\n    *   One may give up the physical objects of the senses, but true knowledge cannot awaken as long as the mind remains impure.\n    *   The mind has a tendency to repeat its previous thoughts. Such repetition creates a channel within the mind, and new thoughts flow irresistibly in the same direction.\n    *   Out of previous habit, the materially contaminated mind keeps running in the direction of anxiety, stress, fear, hatred, envy, attachment, and the whole gamut of material emotions.\n*   **The Interplay between Knowledge and Action**\n    It is said that devotion without philosophy is sentimentality, and philosophy without devotion is intellectual speculation.\n*   **Action and Knowledge: Necessary Components**\n    Action and knowledge are necessary in both karm yog and sanikhya yog.

    "explanation": "**The True Nature of Action**\n=====================================\n\nSome people believe that action refers only to professional work, and not to daily activities such as eating, drinking, sleeping, waking, and thinking. They think that when they renounce their profession, they are not performing actions. However, Shree Krishna has a different perspective.\n\n**Shree Krishna's View on Action**\n-----------------------------------\n\nAccording to Shree Krishna, all activities performed with the body, mind, and tongue are considered actions. He tells Arjun that complete inactivity is impossible even for a moment. If we simply sit down, it is an activity; if we lie down, that is also an activity; if we fall asleep, the mind is still engaged in dreaming. Even in deep sleep, the heart and other bodily organs are functioning.\n\n**The Three Guṇas**\n------------------\n\nShree Krishna declares that for human beings, inactivity is an impossible state to reach. The body-mind-intellect mechanism is compelled by its own make-up of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) to perform work in the world. These three guṇas are natural inclinations that drive us to act.\n\n**A Similar Perspective from the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam contains a similar verse:\n\n`na hi kaśhchit kṣhaṇam api jātu tiṣhṭhaty akarma-kṛit\nkāryate hy avaśhaḥ karma guṇaiḥ svābhāvikair balāt\n(6.1.53)[v1]`\n\n\"Nobody can remain inactive for even a moment. Everyone is forced to act by their modes of nature.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n==============\n\nIn conclusion, as Shree Krishna and the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam remind us, inactivity is an impossible state to reach. Our natural inclinations and bodily functions drive us to act, making it a fundamental aspect of our existence."

    "explanation": "**The Dangers of Hypocritical Renunciation**\n\n3.6\nAttracted by the lure of an ascetic life, people often renounce their work, only to discover later that their renunciation is not accompanied by an equal amount of mental and intellectual withdrawal from the sensual fields. This creates a situation of hypocrisy where one displays an external show of religiosity while internally living a life of ignoble sentiments and base motives.\n\n**The Consequences of Hypocritical Renunciation**\n\nHence, it is better to face the struggles of the world as a karm yogi, than to lead the life of a false ascetic. Running away from the problems of life by prematurely taking sanyās is not the way forward in the journey of the evolution of the soul.\n\n**A Sarcastic Warning from Saint Kabir**\n\nSaint Kabir stated sarcastically:\n\n\"O Ascetic Yogi, you have donned the ochre robes, but you have ignored dyeing your mind with the color of renunciation. You have grown long locks of hair and smeared ash on your body (as a sign of detachment). But without the internal devotion, the external beard you have sprouted only makes you resemble a goat.\"\n\n**A Lesson from Shree Krishna**\n\nShree Krishna states in this verse that people who externally renounce the objects of the senses while continuing to dwell upon them in the mind are hypocrites, and they delude themselves.\n\n**The Story of Tavrit and Suvrit**\n\nThe Puranas relate the story of two brothers, Tavrit and Suvrit, to illustrate this point. The brothers were walking from their house to hear the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam discourse at the temple. On the way, it began raining heavily, so they ran into the nearest building for shelter.\n\n**A Test of Devotion**\n\nTo their dismay, they found themselves in a brothel, where women of disrepute were dancing to entertain their guests. Tavrit, the elder brother, was appalled and walked out into the rain, to continue to the temple. The younger brother, Suvrit, felt no harm in sitting there for a while to escape getting wet in the rain.\n\n**Different Approaches**\n\nTavrit reached the temple and sat for the discourse, but in his mind he became remorseful, “O how boring this is! I made a dreadful mistake; I should have remained at the brothel. My brother must be enjoying himself greatly in revelry there.” Suvrit, on the other hand, started thinking, “Why did I remain in this house of sin? My brother is so holy; he is bathing his intellect in the knowledge of the Bhāgavatam. I too should have braved the rain and reached there. After all, I am not made of salt that I would have melted in a little bit of rain.”\n\n**A Tragic Conclusion**\n\nWhen the rain stopped, both started out in the direction of the other. The moment they met, lightning struck them and they both died on the spot. The Yamdoots (servants of the god of Death) came to take Tavrit to hell. Tavrit complained, “I think you have made a mistake. I am Tavrit. It was my brother who was sitting at the brothel a little while ago. You should be taking him to hell.” The Yamdoots replied, “We have made no mistake. He was sitting there to avoid the rain, but in his mind he was longing to be at the Bhāgavatam discourse. On the other hand, while you were sitting and hearing the discourse, your mind was yearning to be at the brothel.”\n\n**A Lesson from Tavrit's Experience**\n\nTavrit was doing exactly what Shree Krishna declares in this verse; he had externally renounced the objects of the senses, but was dwelling upon them in the mind. This was the improper kind of renunciation.\n\n**The Proper Kind of Renunciation**\n\nThe next verse states the proper kind of renunciation."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Karm Yogi**\n=====================================\n\nThe word \"karm yog\" has been used in this verse. It consists of two main concepts:\n\n*   **Karm** (Occupational duties)\n*   **Yog** (Union with God)\n\nA **karm yogi** is one who performs worldly duties while keeping the mind attached to God. Such a **karm yogi** is not bound by karma even while performing all kinds of works. This is because what binds one to the law of karma is not actions, but the attachment to the fruits of those actions.\n\n*   **Attachment vs. Non-attachment**\n\n    A **karm yogi** has no attachment to the fruits of action. On the other hand, a false renunciant renounces action, but does not forsake attachment, and thus remains bound in the law of karma.\n\n**A Superior Approach**\n==========================\n\nShree Krishna says here that a person in household life who practices **karm yog** is superior to the false renunciant who continues to dwell on the objects of the senses in the mind.\n\n**Contrasting Renunciants**\n==========================\n\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj contrasts these two situations very beautifully:\n\n*   **Mana Hari Meṅ Tana Jagat Meṅ** (When the mind is attached to God and the world)\n*   **Karmayog Tehi Jāna** (Know it to be **karm yog**)\n*   **Tana Hari Meṅ Mana Jagat Meṥ** (When the mind is attached to God, but dwells on the world)\n*   **Yaha Mahāna Ajñāna** (And this is great ignorance)\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n================\n\nThe Bhakti Śhatak verse 84 emphasizes the importance of **karm yog**. When one works in the world with the body but keeps the mind attached to God, it is considered **karm yog**. Conversely, when one engages in spirituality with the body but keeps the mind attached to the world, it is considered hypocrisy.\n\n**Verse 3**\n==============\n\n[v3]\n\n\"When one works in the world with the body, but keeps the mind attached to God, know it to be **karm yog**. When one engages in spirituality with the body, but keeps the mind attached to the world, know it to be hypocrisy.\"\n\nBy understanding the concept of **karm yog**, one can distinguish between genuine spiritual practice and superficial renunciation."

Hence, the Vedas prescribe duties for humans, to help them discipline their mind and senses.\n\n**The Pitfalls of Laziness**\n-------------------------\n\nLaziness is described as one of the biggest pitfalls on the spiritual path:\n\nālasya hi manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥ\nnāstyudyamasamo bandhūḍ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati\n\n“Laziness is the greatest enemy of humans, and is especially pernicious since it resides in their own body.

These obligatory actions are called:\n\nnitya karm\n\nTo neglect these basic maintenance activities is not a sign of progress, but an indication of slothfulness, leading to emaciation and weakness of both body and mind.\n\n### The Benefits of Caring for the Body\n\nOn the other hand, a cared for and nourished body is a positive adjunct on the road to spirituality. Thus, the state of inertia does not lend itself either to material or spiritual achievement.\n\n**Embracing Duties for Spiritual Growth**\n--------------------------------------\n\nFor the progress of our own soul, we should embrace the duties that help elevate and purify our mind and intellect."

    "explanation": "**The Dual Nature of Work**\n=====================================\n\nA knife in the hands of a robber is a weapon for intimidation or committing murder, but in the hands of a surgeon it's an invaluable instrument used for saving people's lives. The knife itself is neither murderous nor benedictory; its effect is determined by how it's used. Similarly, work in itself is neither good nor bad. Depending upon the state of the mind, it can be either binding or elevating.\n\n**The Effect of Work on the Mind**\n-----------------------------------\n\nAs Shakespeare said: “For there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” This philosophy applies to work as well. The effect of our work depends on the state of our mind. Work done for the enjoyment of our senses and the gratification of our pride is the cause of bondage in the material world. On the other hand, work performed as yajña (sacrifice) for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord liberates one from the bonds of Maya and attracts divine grace.\n\n**The Two Modes of Action**\n---------------------------\n\nWe are forced to work in one of the two modes. Since our nature is to perform actions, we cannot remain without working for even a moment as our mind cannot remain still. If we do not perform actions as a sacrifice to God, we will be forced to work to gratify our mind and senses. However, when we perform work as a sacrifice, we look upon the whole world and everything in it as belonging to God, and therefore meant for utilization in his service.\n\n**The Example of King Raghu**\n-------------------------------\n\nA beautiful ideal for this was established by King Raghu, the ancestor of Lord Ram. Raghu performed the Viśhwajit sacrifice, which requires donating all of one's possessions in charity. He thought that just as clouds gather water from the Earth, not for their enjoyment, but to shower it back upon the Earth, similarly all he possessed as a king had been gathered from the public in taxes, not for his pleasure, but for the pleasure of God.\n\n**The Donations of King Raghu**\n-------------------------------\n\nAfter the yajña, Raghu donated all his possessions to his citizens. He then donned the rags of a beggar and held an earthen pot, going out to beg for his meal. While resting under a tree, he heard a group of people discussing, “Our king is so benevolent. He has given away everything in charity.” Raghu was pained on hearing his praise and spoke out, “What are you discussing?” They answered, “We are praising our king. There is nobody in the world as charitable as him.” Raghu retorted, “Do not ever say that again. Raghu has given nothing.” They said, “What kind of person are you who are criticizing our king? Everyone knows that Raghu has donated everything he owned.” Raghu replied, “Go and ask your king that when he came into this world did he possess anything? He was born empty-handed, is it not? Then what was his that he has given away?”\n\n**The Spirit of Karma Yogi**\n-----------------------------\n\nThis is the spirit of karma yog, in which we see the whole world as belonging to God, and hence meant for the satisfaction of God. We then perform our duties not for gratifying our mind and senses, but for the pleasure of God. Lord Vishnu instructed the Prachetas in this fashion:\n\n“The perfect karma yogis, even while fulfilling their household duties, perform all their works as yajña to me, knowing me to be the Enjoyer of all activities. They spend whatever free time they have in hearing and chanting my glories. Such people, though living in the world, never get bound by their actions.”\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, work itself is neither good nor bad. It depends on the state of our mind and how we perform it. By understanding this philosophy, we can learn to perform our duties as a sacrifice to God and liberate ourselves from the bonds of Maya. We can then see the whole world as belonging to God and work towards his satisfaction. This is the spirit of karma yog, which guides us on the path to spiritual growth and self-realization."

All the parts of the system naturally draw from and give back to the whole.\n\n### The Interconnectedness of Nature\n\nThe sun lends stability to the earth and provides heat and light necessary for life to exist. Earth creates food from its soil for our nourishment and also holds essential minerals in its womb for a civilized lifestyle. The air moves the life force in our body and enables transmission of sound energy.\n\nWe humans too are an integral part of the entire system of God’s creation. The air that we breathe, the Earth that we walk upon, the water that we drink, and the light that illumines our day, are all gifts of creation to us. While we partake of these gifts to sustain our lives, we also have our duties toward the integral system.\n\n### Our Obligation\n\nShree Krishna says that we are obligated to participate with the creative force of nature by performing our prescribed duties in the service of God. That is the yajña he expects from us.\n\n### The Example of a Hand\n\nConsider the example of a hand. It is an integral part of the body. It receives its nourishment—blood, oxygen, nutrients, etc.—from the body, and in turn, it performs necessary functions for the body. If the hand looks on this service as burdensome, and decides to get severed from the body, it cannot sustain itself for even a few minutes.\n\nIt is in the performance of its yajña toward the body that the self-interest of the hand is also fulfilled. Similarly, we individual souls are tiny parts of the Supreme Soul and we all have our role to play in the grand scheme of things. When we perform our yajña toward him, our self-interest is naturally satiated.\n\n### The Meaning of Yajña\n\nGenerally, the term yajña refers to fire sacrifice. In the Bhagavad Gita, yajña includes all the prescribed actions laid down in the scriptures, when they are done as an offering to the Supreme.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe unity of nature is a fundamental concept in understanding our place within the grand scheme of creation. By recognizing our interconnectedness with nature and fulfilling our duties toward God, we can find true fulfillment in life."

The Supreme Lord does his work of managing the universe through them.\n\n### Residency of Devatās\nThese devatās live within this material universe, in the higher planes of existence, called swarg, or the celestial abodes.\n\n### Nature of Devatās\nThe devatās are not God; they are souls like us. They occupy specific posts in the affairs of running the world.\n\n### Comparison to Human Government\nConsider the Federal government of a country. There is a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Treasury, a Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and so on. These are posts, and chosen people occupy those posts for a limited tenure.\n\n### Examples of Devatās\nSimilarly, in administering the affairs of the world, there are posts such as Agni Dev (the god of fire), Vāyu Dev (the god of the wind), Varuṇa Dev (the god of the ocean), Indra Dev (the king of the celestial gods), and others.\n\n### Tenure of Devatās\nSouls selected by virtue of their deeds in past lives occupy these seats for a fixed number of ages, and administer the affairs of the universe. These are the devatās (celestial gods).\n\n### The Vedas and Ceremonies for Devatās\nThe Vedas mention various ceremonies and processes for the satisfaction of the celestial gods, and in turn these devatās bestow material prosperity.\n\n### Importance of Yajña\nHowever, when we perform our yajña for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, the celestial gods are automatically appeased.\n\n### The Power of Yajña\nJust as when we water the root of a tree, the water inevitably reaches its flowers, fruits, leaves, branches, and twigs.\n\n### The Skandh Purāṇ\nThe Skandh Purāṇ states:\n```v7]\n\"By worshipping the Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu, we automatically worship all the celestial gods, since they all derive their power from him.\"\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the performance of yajña is naturally pleasing to the devatās, who then create prosperity for living beings by favorably adjusting the elements of material nature."

    "explanation": "**The Devatās: Servants of the Supreme Lord**\n\nAs administrators of various processes of the universe, the devatās provide us with rain, wind, crops, vegetation, minerals, fertile soil, etc. We human beings are indebted to them for all that we receive from them.\n\n**The Devatās Perform Their Duty, Expecting Us to Do Ours**\n\nThe devatās perform their duty, and expect us to perform our duty in the proper consciousness too. Since these celestial gods are all servants of the Supreme Lord, they become pleased when someone performs a sacrifice for him, and in turn assist such a soul by creating favorable material conditions. Thus, it is said that when we strongly resolve to serve God, the universe begins to cooperate with us.\n\n**Thieving Mentality**\n\nHowever, if we begin looking upon the gifts of nature, not as means of serving the Lord but as objects of our own enjoyment, Shree Krishna calls it a thieving mentality.\n\n**Questioning One's Actions**\n\nOften people ask the question, “I lead a virtuous life; I do not harm anyone, nor do I steal anything. But I do not believe in worshipping God, nor do I believe in him. Am I doing anything wrong?”\n\n**Answering the Question**\n\nSuch persons may not be doing anything wrong in the eyes of humans, but they are thieves in the eyes of God. Let us say, we walk into someone’s house, and without recognizing the owner, we sit on the sofa, eat from the refrigerator, and use the restroom. We may claim that we are not doing anything wrong, but we will be considered thieves in the eyes of the law, because the house does not belong to us.\n\n**Applying the Lesson to Our Lives**\n\nSimilarly, the world that we live in was made by God, and everything in it belongs to him. If we utilize his creation for our pleasure, without acknowledging his dominion over it, from the divine perspective we are certainly committing theft.\n\n**A Lesson from Indian History**\n\nThe famous king in Indian history, Chandragupta, asked Chanakya Pundit, his Guru, “According to the Vedic scriptures, what is the position of the king vis-à-vis his subjects?”\n\n**Chanakya Pundit's Response**\n\nChanakya Pundit replied, “The king is the servant of the subjects and nothing else. His God-given duty is to help the citizens of his kingdom progress in their journey toward God-realization.”\n\n**The Universal Principle**\n\nWhether one is a king, a businessperson, a farmer, or a worker, each person, as an integral member of God’s world, is expected to do his or her duty as a service to the Supreme."

    "explanation": "**The Significance of Offering Food to God**\n\nIn the Vedic tradition, food is cooked with the consciousness that the meal is for the pleasure of God. A portion of the food items is then put in a plate and a verbal or mental prayer is made for the Lord to come and eat it. After the offering, the food in the plate is considered **prasād** (grace of God). All the food in the plate and the pots is then accepted as God's grace and eaten in that consciousness. Other religious traditions follow similar customs.\n\n**The Sacrament of Eucharist**\n\nChristianity has the sacrament of the Eucharist, where bread and wine are consecrated and then partaken. Shree Krishna states in this verse that eating **prasād** (food that is first offered as sacrifice to God) releases one from sin, while those who eat food without offering commit sin.\n\n**The Question of Non-Vegetarian Food**\n\nThe question may arise whether we can offer non-vegetarian items to God and then accept the remnants as his **prasād**. The answer to this question is that the Vedas prescribe a vegetarian diet for humans, which includes grains, pulses and beans, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, etc.\n\n**Historical Rejection of Non-Vegetarian Diet**\n\nApart from the Vedic culture, many spiritually evolved souls in the history of all cultures around the world also rejected a non-vegetarian diet that makes the stomach a graveyard for animals. Even though many of them were born in meat-eating families, they gravitated to a vegetarian lifestyle as they advanced on the path of spirituality.\n\n**Quotations Advocating Vegetarianism**\n\nHere are quotations from some famous thinkers and personalities advocating vegetarianism:\n\n### **The Buddha's Teachings**\n\n\"To avoid causing terror to living beings, let the disciple refrain from eating meat… the food of the wise is that which is consumed by the **sādhus**; it does not consist of meat.\"\n\n### **Plutarch's Essay**\n\n\"If you declare that you are naturally designed for such a diet, then first kill for yourself what you want to eat. Do it, however, only through your own resources, unaided by cleaver or cudgel or any kind of ax.\"\n\n### **Pythagoras' Views**\n\n\"As long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.\"\n\n### **Leonardo da Vinci's Abstinence**\n\n\"Truly man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds them. We live by the death of others. We are burial places! I have since an early age abjured the use of meat…\"\n\n### **Thomas Edison's Perspective**\n\n\"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all living beings, we are all savages.\"\n\n### **Leo Tolstoy's Views**\n\n\"Flesh-eating is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to moral feeling—killing.\"\n\n### **Adam Smith's Observations**\n\n\"It may indeed be doubted whether butchers' meat is anywhere a necessary of life… Decency nowhere requires that any man should eat butchers' meat.\"\n\n### **George Bernard Shaw's Humor**\n\n\"I look my age. It is the other people who look older than they are. What can you expect from people who eat corpses?\"\n\n### **J. H. Kellogg's Explanation**\n\n\"A dead cow or sheep lying in a pasture is recognized as carrion. The same sort of carcass dressed and hung up in a butcher's stall passes as food!\"\n\n### **Albert Einstein's Views**\n\n\"It is my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.\"\n\n### **Mahatma Gandhi's Stance**\n\n\"I do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.\"\n\n### **Shree Krishna's Teachings**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna goes further and says that even vegetation contains life, and if we eat it for our own sense enjoyment, we get bound in the karmic reactions of destroying life. The word used in the verse is **ātma-kāraṇāt**, meaning \"for one's individual pleasure\". However, if we eat food as remnants of **yajña** offered to God then the consciousness changes. We then look upon our body as the property of God, which has been put under our care for his service. And we partake of permitted food, as his grace, with the intention that it will nourish the body. In this sentiment, the entire process is consecrated to the Divine.\n\n**The Significance of Yajña**\n\nBharat Muni states:\n\n\"Violence is caused unknowingly to living entities in the process of cooking, by the use of the pestle, fire, grinding instruments, water pot, and broom. Those who cook food for themselves become implicated in the sin. But **yajña** nullifies the sinful reactions.\""

    "explanation": "**The Origin of the Vedas and their Significance**\n\n### The Breath of God: Source of the Vedas\n\n3.15 The Vedas emanated from the breath of God:\n```\nasya mahato bhūtasya ni śhvasitametad yadṛigvedo yajurvedaḥ sāmavedo ’thavaṅgirasaḥ\n(Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad 4.5.11) [v9]\n```\n\n“The four Vedas—Ṛig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, Atharva Veda—all emanated from the breath of the Supreme Divine Personality.”\n \n### Eternal Duties and Sacrifice\n\nIn these eternal Vedas, the duties of humans have been laid down by God himself. These duties have been planned in such a way that through their performance materially engrossed persons may gradually learn to control their desires and slowly elevate themselves from the mode of ignorance to the mode of passion, and from the mode of passion to the mode of goodness. These duties are enjoined to be dedicated to him as \n\nyajña\n. Hence, duties consecrated as sacrifice to God verily become godly, of the nature of God, and non-different from him.\n\n### The Nature of Yajña\n\nThe Tantra Sār states \nyajña\n to be the Supreme Divine Lord himself:\n```\nyajño yajña pumāṁśh chaiva yajñaśho yajña yajñabhāvanaḥ\nyajñabhuk cheti pañchātmā yajñeṣhvijyo hariḥ svayaṁ \n[v10]\n```\n\n### The Bhāgavatam and the Supreme Divine Lord\n\nIn the Bhāgavatam (11.19.39), Shree Krishna declares to Uddhav: \n```\nyajño ’haṁ bhagavattamaḥ\n[v11]“I, the Son of Vasudev, am Yajña.” \n```\n\n### The True Nature of Yajña\n\nThe Vedas state: \n```\nyajño vai viṣhṇuḥ\n [v12]\n```\n\n“Yajña is indeed Lord Vishnu himself.” Reiterating this principle, Shree Krishna says in this verse that God is eternally present in the act of sacrifice."

    "explanation": "**The Universal Cycle (Chakra 3.16)**\n\n### Understanding the Chakra\nThe chakra, or cycle, refers to an ordered series of events. The cycle from grains to rains has been described in verse 3.14. This universal wheel of action is governed by the laws of nature, where all members perform their duties and contribute to its smooth rotation.\n\n### Human Responsibility\nAs part of this universal system, humans are the only beings endowed with free will. We can either contribute to the harmony of the cycle or bring about discord in its smooth functioning. Our actions have consequences, and it is our duty to live as integral parts of the cosmic mechanism.\n\n### The Consequences of Ignoring Responsibility\nWhen a majority of people accept their responsibility, material prosperity abounds, and spiritual growth is promoted. Such periods become golden eras in the social and cultural history of humankind. However, when a significant section of humanity rejects its responsibility, material nature punishes, and peace and prosperity become scarce.\n\n### The Purpose of the Universal Wheel\nThe wheel of nature has been set up by God for disciplining, training, and elevating all living beings. Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that non-compliance with the divine law results in a life of sin and vanity. Those who conform to the law, on the other hand, become pure at heart and free from material contamination.\n\n### The Importance of Conforming to the Divine Law\nNon-compliance with the divine law leads to a life of sin and vanity, where individuals become slaves of their senses. In contrast, those who conform to the law lead a life of spiritual growth and purity. By following the divine law, we can elevate ourselves and contribute to the harmony of the universal cycle.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Acceptance of responsibility is crucial for living in harmony with the universe.\n- Free will allows us to choose our actions and contribute to the cycle.\n- Conforming to the divine law leads to spiritual growth and purity.\n- Non-compliance results in a life of sin and vanity.\n\n**Quote:**\n\"The wheel of nature has been set up by God for disciplining, training, and elevating all living beings.\" - Shree Krishna"

    "explanation": "**The Root of Bondage: Material Desires**\n=====================================================\n\nOnly those who have given up desires for external objects can rejoice and be satisfied in the self. The root of bondage is our material desires, “This should happen; that should not happen.” Shree Krishna explains a little further ahead in this chapter (in verse 3.37) that desire is the cause of all sins, consequently, it must be renounced.\n\n**Understanding Material Desires**\n------------------------------------\n\nAs explained previously (in the purport of verse 2.64), it must be borne in mind that whenever Shree Krishna says we should give up desire, he refers to material desires, and not to the aspirations for spiritual progress or the desire to realize God.\n\n**Why Do Material Desires Arise?**\n---------------------------------------\n\nWhen we identify the self with the body, we identify with the yearnings of the body and mind as the desires of the self, and these send us spinning into the realm of Maya. Sage Tulsidas explains:\n\njiba jiba te hari te bilagāno taba te deha geha nija mānyo,\nmāyā basa swarūp bisarāyo tehi brama te dāruṇa duḥkh pāyo. \n[ v13]\n“When the soul separated itself from God, the material energy covered it in an illusion. By virtue of that illusion, it began thinking of itself as the body, and ever since, in forgetfulness of the self, it has been experiencing immense misery.”\n\n**The Nature of the Self**\n---------------------------\n\nThose who are illumined realize that the self is not material in nature, but divine, and hence imperishable. The perishable objects of the world can never fulfill the thirst of the imperishable soul, and therefore it is a folly to hanker after those sense-objects. Thus, self-illumined souls learn to unite their consciousness with God and experience his infinite bliss within them.\n\n**The Goal of Spiritual Realization**\n---------------------------------------\n\nFor such liberated souls, it is said:\n\nbrahmavit śhruti mūrdhnī\n[v14]\n“Those who have united themselves with God now walk on the head of the Vedas,” i.e. they have no need to follow the rules of the Vedas any longer.\n\n**The Relationship Between Spiritual Realization and Vedic Duties**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe goal of the Vedas is to help unite the soul with God. Once the soul becomes God-realized, the rules of the Vedas, which helped the soul to reach that destination, now no longer apply; the soul has transcended their area of jurisdiction. For example, a pundit unites a man and woman in wedlock by performing the marriage ceremony. Once the ceremony is over, he says, “You are now husband and wife; I am leaving.” His task is over. If the wife says, “Punditji, the vows you made us take during the marriage ceremony are not being followed by my husband, the pundit will reply, “That is not my area of expertise. My duty was to get you both united in marriage and that work is over.” Similarly, the Vedas are there to help unite the self with the Supreme Self. When God-realization takes place, the task of the Vedas is over. Such an enlightened soul is no longer obliged to perform the Vedic duties.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, spiritual realization is a profound process that involves the transcendence of material desires and the identification with the divine. By understanding the nature of the self and the goal of spiritual realization, we can begin to see that our true nature is not bound by the limitations of the material world."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Self-Realized Personalities**\n\n3.18 These self-realized personalities are situated on the transcendental platform of the soul. Their every activity is transcendental, in service of God. So the duties prescribed for worldly people at the bodily level, in accordance with the Varṇāśhram Dharma, no longer apply to them.\n\n**Distinction between Karma and Bhakti**\n\nHere, the distinction needs to be made between karma (or prescribed worldly duties) and bhakti (pure spiritual activities). Previously, Shree Krishna was talking about karma, saying that they must be done as an offering to God. This was necessary to purify the mind, helping it rise above worldly contamination. But self-realized souls have already reached absorption in God and developed purity of mind.\n\n**Nature of Self-Realized Souls**\n\nThese transcendentalists are directly engaged in bhakti, or pure spiritual activities, such as meditation, worship, kīrtan (devotional singing), service to the Guru, etc. If such souls reject their worldly duties, it is not considered a sin. They may continue to perform worldly duties if they wish, but they are not obliged to do them.\n\n**Historical Examples of Saints**\n\nHistorically, Saints have been of two kinds:\n\n1. **Karm Yogis**\n\t* Those like Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, and Vibheeshan, who continued to discharge their worldly duties even after attaining the transcendental platform.\n\t* Externally, they were doing their duties with their body while internally their minds were attached to God.\n2. **Karm Sanyasīs**\n\t* Those like Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who rejected their worldly duties and accepted the renounced order of life.\n\t* Both internally and externally, with both body and mind, engaged only in devotion to God.\n\n**Recommendation by Shree Krishna**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that both options exist for the self-realized sage. He states this in the next verse, which of these he recommends to Arjun."

Shree Krishna’s recommendation for him is to be a **karm yogi**, and not take **karm sanyās**.\n\n### The Reason Behind Shree Krishna's Recommendation\n\nHe explains the reason for this in verses 3.20 to 3.26.\n\n### What is a **Karm Yogi**?\n\nA **karm yogi** refers to an individual who performs their prescribed duties without attachment or expectation of reward. This path is conducive to spiritual growth and self-realization.\n\n### Why Avoid **Karm Sanyās**?\n\nAvoiding **karm sanyās**, or complete renunciation of material life, allows an individual to maintain a connection with the physical world and perform their prescribed duties in a way that is beneficial to themselves and society.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- Shree Krishna recommends **karm yogi** over **karm sanyās** for Arjun.\n- A **karm yogi** performs prescribed duties without attachment or expectation of reward.\n- Avoiding **karm sanyās** allows for connection with the physical world and performance of duties beneficial to individuals and society."

    "explanation": "**The True Reason Behind Human Effort**\n\n3.22\nThe reason why we all work is because we need something. We are all tiny parts of God, who is an ocean of bliss, and hence we all seek bliss. Since, we have not attained perfect bliss as yet, we feel dissatisfied and incomplete. So whatever we do is for the sake of attaining bliss. However, bliss is one of God’s energies and he alone possesses it to the infinite extent.\n\n### Characteristics of a Self-Realized Being\n\nHe is perfect and complete in himself and has no need of anything outside of himself. Hence, he is also called \nĀtmārām\n (one who rejoices in the self),\nĀtma-ratī\n (one who is attracted to his or her own self), and \nĀtma-krīḍa\n (one who performs divine pastimes with his or her own self).\n\n**The True Motivation Behind Human Effort**\n\nIf such a personality does work, there can be only one reason for it—it will not be for oneself, rather for the welfare of others. Thus, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that although in his personal form as Shree Krishna, he has no duty to perform in the universe, yet he works for the welfare of others.\n\n### Welfare Accomplished Through Selfless Effort\n\nHe next explains the welfare that is accomplished when he works. This welfare is achieved when a self-realized being performs actions without attachment to the results, and solely for the benefit of others.

Had Shree Krishna failed to perform Vedic duties, human beings following his example would be led away from the discipline of karm, into a state of chaos. This would have been a very serious offence and Lord Krishna would be considered at fault.\n\n**The Case of Arjun**\n\nSimilarly, Arjun was world-famous for being undefeated in battle, and was the brother of the virtuous King Yudhisthir. If Arjun refused to fulfill his duty to protect dharma, then many other worthy and noble warriors could follow his example and also renounce their prescribed duty of protecting righteousness.\n\n**Consequences of Neglecting Duty to Protect Dharma**\n\nThis would bring destruction to the world balance and the rout of innocent and virtuous people. Thus, for the benefit of the entire human race and the welfare of the world, Shree Krishna coaxed Arjun not to neglect performing his prescribed Vedic activities.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   Neglecting one's occupational duties can lead to chaos and destruction in society.\n*   Imitation of others' behavior can perpetuate negative consequences.\n*   The duty to protect dharma is essential for maintaining social balance and order.\n\n**Importance of Fulfilling One's Duties**\n\nIn conclusion, fulfilling one's occupational duties is essential for maintaining social balance and order. It is a crucial aspect of living a virtuous life, as emphasized by Lord Krishna in his interactions with Arjun."

In this verse, Shree Krishna's expression *saktāḥ avidvānsaḥ* is used to describe people who are as yet in bodily consciousness and attached to worldly pleasures, but have full faith in the Vedic rituals sanctioned by the scriptures.\n\n### Characteristics of Ignorant People\n---------------------------------------\n\nSuch ignorant people perform their duty scrupulously according to the ordinance of the scriptures, without indolence or doubt. They have firm faith that the performance of Vedic duties and rituals will bring the material rewards they desire.\n\n### Breakdown of Faith\n---------------------\n\nIf the faith of such people in rituals is broken, without their having developed faith in the higher principle of devotion, they will have nowhere to go.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Advice to Arjun\n-----------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna urges Arjun that just as ignorant people faithfully perform ritualistic duties, so also the wise should perform their works dutifully, not for material rewards, but for setting an ideal for the rest of society.\n\n### Dharma Yuddha\n-----------------\n\nThus, for the welfare of society, Arjun should perform his duty as a warrior in this particular situation, which is a *dharma yuddha* (war of righteousness).\n\n### Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:\ntāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatā\nmat-kathā-śhravaṇādau vā śhraddhā yāvan na jāyate \n(11.20.9)[v16]\n\"One should continue to perform karm as long as one has not developed renunciation from the sense objects and attachment to God.\"\n\nIn summary, Shree Krishna's expression *loka-saṅgraham* emphasizes the importance of acting for the benefit of humankind. He advises Arjun to perform his duty as a warrior, not just for material rewards but for setting an ideal for the rest of society."

    "explanation": "## Verse Explanation: Lord Krishna's Teachings on Karma and Vedic Actions\n### Understanding the Responsibility of Wise Persons\n\nGreat persons have greater responsibility because common people follow them. So Shree Krishna urges that wise people should not perform any actions or make any utterances that lead the ignorant toward downfall. It may be argued that if the wise feel compassion for the ignorant, they should give them the highest knowledge—the knowledge of God-realization.\n\n### Neutralizing the Argument\n\nLord Krishna neutralizes this argument by stating:\n\nn a buddhi-bhedaṁ janayet\n, meaning the ignorant should not be asked to abandon duties by giving superior instructions they are not qualified to understand.\n\n### The Dangers of Escapism\n\nUsually, people in material consciousness consider only two options. Either they are willing to work hard for fruitive results or they wish to give up all exertions on the plea that all works are laborious, painful, and wrought with evil. Between these, working for results is far superior to the escapist approach.\n\n### The Importance of Inspiring Dutiful Behavior\n\nHence, the spiritually wise in Vedic knowledge should inspire the ignorant to perform their duties with attentiveness and care. If the minds of the ignorant become disturbed and unsettled then they may lose faith in working altogether, and with actions stopped and knowledge not arising, the ignorant will lose out from both sides.\n\n### The Consequences of Ignorance\n\nIf both the ignorant and the wise perform Vedic actions, then what is the difference between them? Apprehending such a question, Shree Krishna explains this in the next two verses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, wise persons have a greater responsibility to guide the ignorant and inspire them to perform their duties with attentiveness and care. Escapism is not a viable option, as it can lead to loss of faith and knowledge. By working for results, wise persons can help the ignorant achieve their goals and realize their potential."

    "explanation": "**The Deceptive Concept of Doership**\n=====================================\n\nWe can see that the natural phenomena of the world are not directed by us, but are performed by \n**prakṛiti**\n, or Mother Nature. Now, for the actions of our own body, we usually divide them into two categories:\n\n### Two Categories of Actions\n\n1.  **Natural Biological Functions**\n    *   Such as digestion, blood circulation, heartbeat, etc., which we do not consciously execute but which occur naturally.\n2.  **Actions such as**\n    *   Speaking, hearing, walking, sleeping, working etc., that we think we perform.\n\nBoth these categories of works are performed by the **mind-body-senses mechanism**. All the parts of this mechanism are made from \n**prakṛiti**\n, or the material energy, which consists of the three modes (\n**guṇas**\n)—goodness (\n**sattva**\n), passion (\n**rajas**\n), and ignorance (\n**tamas**\n). Just as waves are not separate from the ocean, but a part of it, similarly the body is a part of Mother Nature from which it is created. Hence, material energy is the doer of everything.\n\n**The Illusion of Doership**\n-------------------------\n\nWhy then does the soul perceive itself to be doing activities? The reason is that, in the grip of the unforgiving ego, the soul falsely identifies itself with the body. Hence, it remains under the illusion of doership.\n\n### An Analogy to Understand the Illusion\n\nLet us say there are two trains standing side-by-side on the railway platform, and a passenger on one train fixes his gaze on the other. When the second train moves, it seems that the first is moving. Likewise the immobile soul identifies with the mobility of \n**prakṛiti**\n. Thus, it perceives itself as the doer of actions.\n\n**Realization of Non-Doership**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe moment the soul eliminates the ego and surrenders to the will of God, it realizes itself as the non-doer.\n\n**A Question on Karma**\n----------------------\n\nOne may question that if the soul is truly the non-doer, then why is it implicated in law of karma for actions performed by the body? The reason is that the soul does not itself perform actions, but it does direct the actions of the senses-mind-intellect.\n\n### An Analogy for Karma\n\nFor example, a chariot driver does not pull the chariot himself, but he does direct the horses. Now, if there is any accident, it is not the horses that are blamed, but the driver who was directing them. Similarly, the soul is held responsible for the actions of the mind-body mechanism because the senses-mind-intellect work on receiving inspiration from the soul.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the soul's perception of itself as a doer is an illusion created by the ego. By eliminating the ego and surrendering to the will of God, the soul realizes its true nature as a non-doer. And although the soul does not perform actions, it is still implicated in the law of karma due to its role as a director of the senses-mind-intellect."

This verse talks about the \ntattva-vit\n, or the knowers of the Truth. Having thus abolished the ego, they are free from bodily identifications, and are able to discern their spiritual identity distinct from the corporeal body.\n\n**The Liberation of True Knowledge**\n\nHence, they are not beguiled into thinking of themselves as the doers of their material actions, and instead they attribute every activity to the movements of the three \nguṇas\n. Such God-realized Saints say:\n\n### \"God is doing everything, but people are thinking that I am doing.\"\n\n**The Implication of True Knowledge**\n\nJo karai so hari karai, hota kabīr kabīr\n[v17]\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThis verse highlights the importance of understanding the nature of true knowledge. The tattva-vit, or the knowers of the Truth, have transcended the limitations of their ego and are able to see beyond the material world. They attribute all actions to the movements of the three guṇas, recognizing that they are not the primary cause of their actions.\n\n**The Reality Exposed**\n\nIn essence, this verse reveals that people mistakenly attribute their actions to themselves, when in fact, everything is being done by God. As the verse so eloquently puts it, \"God is doing everything, but people are thinking that I am doing.\" This understanding allows for a deeper level of spiritual awareness and a clearer recognition of the true nature of reality."

The words\n\nadhyātma chetasā\nmean “with the thoughts resting on God.” This philosophy teaches us to dedicate all our actions to him. \n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Sanyasya (Renouncing All Activities)**:\n    *   Sanyasya means “renouncing all activities that are not dedicated to him.”\n    *   This concept teaches us to focus on our spiritual growth and renounce worldly attachments.\n\n*   **Nirāśhīḥ (Without Hankering for Results)**:\n    *   Nirāśhīḥ means “without hankering for the results of the actions.”\n    *   This philosophy teaches us to let go of our ego and not seek personal gain or recognition.\n\n**The Essence of the Instructions**\n\nThe summary of the instructions in the previous verses is that one should very faithfully reflect, “My soul is a tiny part of the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna. He is the Enjoyer and Master of all. All my works are meant for his pleasure, and thus, I should perform my duties in the spirit of\nyajña\nor sacrifice to him. He supplies the energy by which I accomplish works of\nyajña\n.**\n\n**The Importance of Yajña (Sacrifice)**\n\n*   **Yajña**: The practice of performing acts that bring joy and satisfaction to the Supreme Lord.\n*   **Sacrifice**: The act of dedicating our actions to the Supreme Lord, seeking his pleasure and guidance.\n\n**The Role of God's Energy**\n\n*   **God's Energy**: The divine energy that inspires and guides us in our actions.\n*   **Supplies the Energy**: God's energy is the source of all creation, and we must acknowledge its power in our lives.\n\n**The Purpose of Our Actions**\n\n*   **All My Works**: Dedicate all your actions to the Supreme Lord, seeking his pleasure and guidance in return.\n*   **Performing D duties**: Act with the intention of pleasing the Supreme Lord, and he will supply you with the energy to accomplish your tasks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe teachings of Shree Krishna remind us that our actions should be dedicated to the Supreme Lord. By reflecting on this philosophy, we can cultivate a deeper understanding of our place in the universe and the role that God plays in our lives."

    "explanation": "**Accepting the Teachings of Bhagavad Gita with Faith and Humility**\n\nThe Supreme Lord describes the **siddhānt** (principle) explained by him as **mata** (opinion). An opinion is a personal view, while a principle is a universal fact. Opinions can differ amongst teachers, but the principle remains the same. Philosophers and teachers often name their opinion as principle, but in the Gita, the Lord has named the principle explained by him as opinion. By his example, he is teaching us **humility and cordiality**.\n\n### The Virtues of Accepting the Teachings with Faith\n\nGiven the call for action, Shree Krishna now points out the virtues of accepting the teachings of **Bhagavad Gita** with faith and following them in one's life. Our prerogative as humans is to know the truth and then modify our lives accordingly. In this way, our mental fever (of lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.) gets pacified.\n\n### The Need for Conviction\n\nIn the previous verse, Shree Krishna had clearly explained to Arjun to offer all works to him. However, he knows that this statement can cause ridicule from those who have no belief in God and rebuke from those who are envious of him. So, he now emphasizes the need for accepting the teachings with **conviction**. He says that by faithfully following these teachings one becomes free from the bondage of karma.\n\n### The Fate of Those Who are Faithless\n\nBut what happens to those who are **faithless**? Their position is explained next."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Faith (Śhraddhā) in Understanding the Bhagavad Gita**\n==================================================================\n\nThe teachings presented by Shree Krishna are perfect for our eternal welfare. However, our material intellect has innumerable imperfections, and so we are not always able to comprehend the sublimity of his teachings or appreciate their benefits. If we could, what would be the difference between us tiny souls and the Supreme Divine Personality?\n\n### The Need for Faith (Śhraddhā)\nTo overcome this limitation, faith becomes a necessary ingredient for accepting the divine teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n**Definition of Faith (Śhraddhā)**\n--------------------------------\n\nAccording to Jagadguru Shankaracharaya:\n\n`guru vedānta vākyeṣhu dṛḍho viśvāsaḥ śhraddhā\n[v18]`\n\n\"Śhraddhā is strong faith in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\"\n\nSimilarly, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explained it as:\n\n`śhraddhā śhabde viśhwāsa kahe sudṛḍha niśhchaya \n(Chaitanya Charitāmṛt, Madhya Leela, 22.62)[v19]`\n\n\"The word Śhraddhā means strong faith in God and Guru, even though we may not comprehend their message at present.\"\n\n### The Power of Faith\n---------------------\n\nShree Krishna's teachings can be understood through faith, even if we cannot comprehend them at present. As Alfred Tennyson said:\n\n\"By faith alone, embrace believing, where we cannot prove.\"\n\nSo, faith means earnestly digesting the comprehensible portions of the Bhagavad Gita and also accepting the abstruse portions, with the hope that they will become comprehensible in future.\n\n### The Persistent Defect of Pride\n----------------------------------\n\nHowever, one of the persistent defects of the material intellect is pride. Due to pride, whatever the intellect cannot comprehend at present, it often rejects as incorrect.\n\nShree Krishna's teachings are presented by the omniscient Lord for the welfare of the souls, yet people still find fault in them. For example:\n\n\"Why is God asking everything to be offered to him? Is he greedy? Is he an egotist that he asks Arjun to worship him?\"\n\nShree Krishna responds by saying that such people are:\n\n`achetasaḥ\n, or “devoid of discrimination,”`\nbecause they cannot distinguish between the pure and the impure, the righteous and the unrighteous, the Creator and the created, the Supreme Master and the servant.\n\n**The Consequences of Not Having Faith (Śhraddhā)**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSuch people \"bring about their own ruin,\" because they reject the path to eternal salvation and keep rotating in the cycle of life and death.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n------------------\n\nFaith (Śhraddhā) is a necessary ingredient for understanding the divine teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. It means trusting in the words of the Guru and the scriptures, even if we cannot comprehend them at present. By cultivating faith, we can overcome our limitations and progress in spirituality through sadhanā."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Nature: A Key to Spiritual Advancement**\n====================================================================\n\n3.33 Shree Krishna again comes back to the point about action being superior to inaction. Propelled by their natures, people are inclined to act in accordance with their individual modes. Even those who are theoretically learned carry with them the baggage of the \n**Sanskārs**\n(tendencies and impressions) of endless past lives, the \n**Prārabdha**\nkarma of this life, and the individual traits of their minds and intellects. They find it difficult to resist this force of habit and nature.\n\n**Challenges in Resisting Nature's Force**\n------------------------------------------\n\nIf the Vedic scriptures instructed them to give up all works and engage in pure spirituality, it would create an unstable situation. Such artificial repression would be counter-productive. The proper and easier way for spiritual advancement is to utilize the immense force of habit and tendencies and dovetail it in the direction of God.\n\n**The Importance of Accepting Our Present Condition**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have to begin the spiritual ascent from where we stand, and doing so requires we have to first accept our present condition of what we are and then improve on it.\n\n**Nature's Influence in the Animal Kingdom**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWe can see how even animals act according to their unique natures. For example:\n\n*   **Ants**: social creatures that bring food for the community while forsaking it themselves, a quality difficult to find in human society.\n*   **Cows**: intense attachment for their calf, causing them to feel disturbed when it is out of sight.\n*   **Dogs**: display the virtue of loyalty to depths that cannot be matched by humans.\n\n**Applying Nature's Influence to Human Behavior**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, we humans too are propelled by our natures. Since Arjun was a warrior by nature, Shree Krishna told him:\n\n> \"If, motivated by pride, you think, “I shall not fight,” your decision will be in vain. Your own nature will compel you to fight.\" (Bhagavad Gita 18.59)\n>\n> \"O Arjun, that action which out of delusion you do not wish to do, you will be driven to do it by your own inclination, born of your own material nature.\" (Bhagavad Gita 18.60)\n\n**Sublimating Nature's Influence**\n---------------------------------\n\nThat nature should be sublimated by shifting the goal from worldly enjoyment to God-realization, and performing our prescribed duty without attachment and aversion, in the spirit of service to God."

    "explanation": "**Harnessing the Mind and Senses**\n\n3.34\nAlthough Shree Krishna previously emphasized that the mind and senses are propelled by their natural tendencies, he now opens up the possibility of harnessing them. As long as we have the material body, for its maintenance, we have to utilize the objects of the senses. Shree Krishna is not asking us to stop consuming what is necessary, but to practice eradicating attachment and aversion.\n\n**The Influence of Past Life Tendencies**\n\nDefinitely, sanskārs (past life tendencies) do have a deep-rooted influence on all living beings. However, if we practice the method taught in the Bhagavad Gita, we can succeed in correcting the situation.\n\n**The Natural Interaction of Senses and Sense Objects**\n\nThe senses naturally run toward the sense objects, and their mutual interaction creates sensations of pleasure and pain. For example:\n\n*   The taste buds experience joy in contact with delicious foods and distress in contact with bitter foods.\n*   The mind repeatedly contemplates the sensations of pleasure and pain which it associates with these objects.\n\n**Creating Attachment and Aversion**\n\nThoughts of pleasure in the sense objects create attachment, while thoughts of pain create aversion. Shree Krishna tells Arjun to succumb neither to feelings of attachment nor aversion.\n\n**Overcoming the Lower Nature**\n\nIn the discharge of our worldly duty, we will have to encounter all kinds of likeable and unlikeable situations. We must practice neither to yearn for the likeable situations, nor to avoid the unlikeable situations. When we stop being slaves of both the likes and dislikes of the mind and senses, we will overcome our lower nature.\n\n**Transcending Pleasure and Pain**\n\nAnd when we become indifferent to both pleasure and pain in the discharge of our duty, we will become truly free to act from our higher nature."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Dharma: A Central Concept in Hinduism and Buddhism**\n====================================================================\n\n### The Elusive Word 'Dharma'\n\n3.35 In this verse, the word **dharma** has been used four times. \nDharma is a word commonly used in Hinduism and Buddhism. But it is the most elusive word to translate into the English language. Terms like righteousness, good conduct, duty, noble quality, etc. only describe an aspect of its meaning.\n\n### The Roots of 'Dharma'\n\nDharma comes from the root word **dhṛi**, which means \"ḍhāraṇ karane yogya\", or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.” For example, the dharma of the soul is to love God. It is like the central law of our being.\n\n### The Concept of 'Swadharma'\n\nThe prefix **swa** means \"the self.\" Thus, **swa-dharma** is our personal dharma, which is the dharma applicable to our context, situation, maturity, and profession in life. This **swa-dharma** can change as our context in life changes, and as we grow spiritually.\n\n### The Importance of Following Your Own Dharma\n\nBy asking Arjun to follow his **swa-dharma**, Shree Krishna is telling him to follow his profession, and not change it because someone else may be doing something else. It is more enjoyable to be ourselves than to pretend to be someone else. The duties born of our nature can be easily performed with stability of mind.\n\n### The Consequences of Not Following Your Own Dharma\n\nThe duties of others may seem attractive from a distance and we may think of switching, but that is a risky thing to do. If they conflict with our nature, they will create disharmony in our senses, mind, and intellect. This will be detrimental for our consciousness and will hinder our progress on the spiritual path.\n\n### A Powerful Message from Shree Krishna\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes this point dramatically by saying that it is better to die in the faithful performance of one’s duty than to be in the unnatural position of doing another’s duty."

Arjun wishes to lead such a divine life, but finds the advice difficult to implement. So he asks Shree Krishna a question that is very realistic and representative of the human struggle. He says, “What force prevents us from reaching this high ideal? What makes one succumb to attachment and aversion?”\n\n**The Role of Conscience**\n\nWe all have a conscience that makes us feel remorseful while committing a sin. The conscience is grounded in the fact that God is the abode of virtue, and as his fragments, we all have an innate attraction for virtue and goodness. The goodness that is the nature of the soul gives rise to the voice of conscience.\n\n**The Human Struggle**\n\nThus, we cannot make the excuse that we did not know stealing, swindling, libel, extortion, murder, oppression, and corruption are sinful activities. We intuitively know these deeds to be sinful, and yet we commit such acts, as if some strong force impels us to do them.\n\n**Arjun's Quest for Knowledge**\n\nArjun wishes to know what that strong force is, and how it can be overcome in order to lead a divine life.

This lust manifests in various ways, including:\n\n*   The urge for money\n*   Physical cravings\n*   Craving for prestige\n*   The drive for power\n\n### The Perversion of Divine Love\n\nLust is a distorted reflection of the inherent divine love for God that resides within every living being when its soul associates with the material energy in the form of the body. This divine love is transformed into lust, influenced by the mode of passion.\n\n### The Effects of Lust on the Soul\n\nWhen the soul is deluded by the mode of passion, it believes that worldly objects can bring satisfaction. This creates desires for acquiring them.\n\n**Consequences of Lust**\n==========================\n\n*   **Lust**: The root of all evil\n*   **Greed**: Intensified desire\n*   **Anger**: Frustrated desire\n\nWhen desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed. When it is not satisfied, it gives rise to anger.\n\n### The Chain of Sin\n\nThe combination of lust, greed, and anger leads to committing sins. This is because all three are influenced by the mode of passion.\n\n**The Labeling of Lust as Evil**\n==============================\n\nShree Krishna identifies lust, or desire, as the root of all evil. This highlights the importance of recognizing and overcoming lust to achieve spiritual growth.\n\n### The Cycle of Desire\n\nThe cycle of desire can be broken by understanding and managing the three main influences:\n\n*   Lust (the root of all evil)\n*   Greed (intensified desire)\n*   Anger (frustrated desire)\n\nOnly by recognizing and transcending these influences can one achieve liberation from the cycle of desire."

This partial obscuring is like the thin cloud that sāttvic desires create.\n\n### Mirror\n\nA mirror, which is naturally reflective, gets obscured by dust. This semi-opacity is like the masking impact of rājasic desires on the intellect.\n\n### Embryo\n\nAn embryo gets concealed in the womb. This complete obfuscation is like the consequence of tāmasic desires subverting the power of discrimination.\n\nSimilarly, in proportion to the grade of our desires, the spiritual knowledge we may have heard and read gets shrouded.\n\n**The Story**\n-------------\n\nThere is a beautiful allegorical story to illustrate this point.\n\nA man used to take his evening walk by the side of a forest. One evening, he decided to walk in the forest instead. When he had walked a couple of miles, the sun began setting and the light started fading.\n\nHe turned around to walk out of the forest, but to his dismay he found that animals had gathered on the other side. These ferocious animals started chasing him and to escape from them, he ran deeper into the forest.\n\nWhile running, he found a witch standing in front of him with open arms to embrace him. To escape her, he turned direction and ran perpendicular to the animals and the witch.\n\nBy then, it had become dark. Unable to see much, he ran over a ditch that was covered by vine hanging from a tree. He fell headlong, but his feet became entangled in the vine.\n\nAs a result, he began hanging upside down above the ditch. After a few moments he came to his senses and saw a snake sitting at the bottom of the ditch, waiting to bite him if he fell down.\n\nIn the meantime, two mice appeared—one white and one black—and started nibbling at the branch from which the vine was hanging. To confound his problems, some wasps gathered and began stinging him on his face.\n\n**The Man's Situation**\n-----------------------\n\nIn this precarious situation, it was found that the man was smiling. Philosophers gathered to ponder how he could smile in such a dire strait.\n\nThey looked upwards and found a beehive, from which honey was dripping onto his tongue. He was licking the honey and thinking how pleasurable it was; he had forgotten the animals, the witch, the snake, the mice, and the wasps.\n\n**Interpretation**\n-----------------\n\nThe person in the story may seem insane to us. However, this tale depicts the condition of all humans under the influence of desire.\n\nThe forest in which the man was walking represents the material world in which we live, where there is danger at every step.\n\nThe animals that chased him represent diseases that begin to appear in life, and continue harassing us until death.\n\nThe witch represented old age that is waiting to embrace us with the passage of time.\n\nThe snake at the bottom of the pit is like the inevitable death that awaits us all.\n\nThe white and black mice that were nibbling on the branch represent day and night, which are steadily reducing our life and bringing us closer to death.\n\nThe wasps that were stinging the face are like the innumerable desires that arise in the mind and agitate it, causing us pain and distress.\n\nHoney represents the sensual enjoyment we experience in the world, which clouds the discrimination of our intellect. Hence, forgetting our precarious position, we remain absorbed in enjoying the temporary delights of the senses.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nShree Krishna states that it is this type of lustful desire that is responsible for shrouding our power of discrimination."

    "explanation": "**The Inimical Nature of Lust**\n\n### An Exquisite Explanation from the Dhammapada Verse 186\n\n3.39 Here, the inimical nature of **kām**, or lust, is being made even more explicit by Lord Krishna. **Kām** means \"desire\", **duṣhpūreṇa** means \"insatiable\", and **anala** means \"inexhaustible\". Desire overpowers the discriminatory power of the wise and lures them to fulfill it. However, the more they attempt to dowse the fire of desire, the more strongly it burns.\n\n### The Destructive Cycle of Desire\n\nThe Buddha states:\n> \"Desire burns like an unquenchable fire, which never brings happiness to anyone. The wise renounce it, knowing it to be the root of misery.\"\n>\n> But those who do not understand this secret waste away their life in the futile pursuit of trying to satiate their lust.\n\n### The Consequences of Unwavering Desire\n\n#### Effects on the Wise\nThe wise renounce desire, aware that it is the root of misery. They understand that despite their efforts to control it, desire persists and intensifies.\n\n#### The Futility of Attempting to Silence Desire\nThose who do not comprehend the nature of desire continue to struggle with it, leading to a life of unfulfilled longing and dissatisfaction.\n\n### The Teachings of the Dhammapada\n\n*   **Na kahāpaṇa vassena, titti kāmesu vijjati**: Desire is never satiated.\n*   **Appassādā kāmā dukhā kāmā, iti viññāya paṇḍito**: Desire leads to suffering; the wise understand this.\n\n#### The Eternal Struggle with Desire\n\nDesire overpowers even the most intelligent and wise individuals. It is an insatiable force that consumes us all, leaving nothing but suffering in its wake.\n\n#### The Importance of Self-Reflection\n\nIt is only by understanding the nature of desire and its consequences that we can begin to break free from its grasp. By recognizing its insatiable nature, we may learn to renounce it and find true peace.\n\n#### The Ultimate Goal of Liberation\n\nBy acknowledging the root cause of our suffering, we may find it possible to transcend the cycle of desire and attain liberation.\n\n*   **V20**: The verse number for reference purposes."

The fortress of the enemy must be spotted before one can lay siege on it.\n\n**The Three Sources of Lust**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna states that the senses, mind, and intellect are the places from where lust exercises its dominion over the soul. Under the sway of lust, the sense objects are desired by the senses, the senses infatuate the mind, the mind misleads the intellect, and the intellect loses its discriminatory powers.\n\n**The Effects of Lust on the Intellect**\n\nWhen the intellect is clouded, the living being is deluded to become a slave of lust and will do anything to satiate it.\n\n**The True Nature of the Senses, Mind, and Intellect**\n\nThese instruments—senses, mind, and intellect—are not bad in themselves. They were given to us for the purpose of achieving God-realization, but we have permitted lust in its many forms to lay siege on them. Now, we have to use the same senses, mind, and intellect to uplift ourselves.\n\n**The Path Forward**\n\nIn the following verses, Shree Krishna explains how to do that."

    "explanation": "**Overcoming Lust: The Root of All Evil**\n====================================================\n\nNow, Shree Krishna explains how to overcome lust, the root of all evil, which is so pernicious to human consciousness. Having identified the repositories of lust, Shree Krishna asks Arjun, at the outset, to curb the desires of the senses. Permitting them to arise is the cause of our miseries, while eliminating them is the way to peace.\n\n**The Cause of Our Miseries**\n-----------------------------\n\nConsider this example:\n\nRamesh and Dinesh were two fellow students sharing the same room in the hostel. At 10 pm at night, Ramesh developed the desire to smoke cigarettes.\n\n### The Desire is Created\n\nHe said, “I am getting the urge to smoke.” Dinesh replied, “It is so late at night. Forget about cigarettes and go to sleep.” “No…no…I will not be able to sleep until I puff the tobacco,” said Ramesh.\n\n### The Consequences of Allowing Desire to Arise\n\nDinesh went to sleep, but Ramesh went out in search of cigarettes. The shops nearby had closed. It took him two hours until he finally returned to the hostel with the cigarette and had a smoke.\n\n### The Morning After\n\nIn the morning, Dinesh asked him, “Ramesh, when did you sleep at night?” “At midnight.” “Really! That means you remained agitated for cigarettes for two hours and when you had your puffs, you returned to the same state that you were in at 10 pm.” “What do you mean by that?” asked Ramesh. “Look, at 10 pm you did not have any desire for cigarettes, and you were peaceful. Then you yourself created the desire for them. From 10 pm to midnight, you remained agitated for cigarettes. Finally, when you smoked them, the disease, which you had created, went away, and you got to sleep. I, on the other hand, did not create any desire, and slept peacefully at 10 pm itself.”\n\n### The Pattern of Desire\n\nIn this way, we create desires for the objects of the senses of the body, and then become agitated by them. When we get the cherished object, the disease of our own creation gets eradicated, and we think of it as happiness.\n\n**Renouncing Material Desires**\n-----------------------------------\n\nHowever, if we think of ourselves as the soul and our only purpose is happiness of the soul, then it becomes easier to renounce such material desires. Shree Krishna tells Arjun to bring the senses under control, thereby slaying the lust residing in them.\n\n**Using Higher Instruments**\n-------------------------------\n\nTo accomplish this, we must use the higher instruments given by God to us, as stated in the next verse."

Shree Krishna explains the gradation of superiority amongst the instruments God has provided to us.\n\n### The Sequence of Superiority\n\nThe sequence of superiority is as follows:\n\n*   **Gross Matter**: The body is made of gross matter, which is the most inferior entity.\n*   **Five Knowledge-Bearing Senses**: Superior to it are the five knowledge-bearing senses, which grasp the perceptions of:\n    *   Taste\n    *   Touch\n    *   Sight\n    *   Smell\n    *   Sound\n\n*   **Mind**: Beyond the senses is the mind, which is capable of perceiving and processing information.\n*   **Intellect**: Superior to the mind is the intellect, with its ability to discriminate and make judgments.\n*   **Divine Soul**: Even beyond the intellect is the divine soul, which is the most superior entity.\n\n### Application of This Knowledge\n\nThis knowledge of the sequence of superiority amongst the senses, mind, intellect, and soul can now be used for rooting out lust, as explained in the final verse of this chapter."

    "explanation": "**The Upanishadic Analogy: A Path to Spiritual Awakening**\n===========================================================\n\nIn conclusion, Shree Krishna emphasizes that we should slay this enemy called lust through knowledge of the self. Since the soul is a part of God, it is divine in nature. Thus, the divine bliss it seeks can only be attained from a divine subject, while the objects of the world are all material. These material objects can never fulfill the innate longing of the soul and so it is futile to create desires for them.\n\nWe must exert and train the intellect to think in this manner, and then use it to control the mind and the senses. This is explained very beautifully in the Kaṭhopaniṣhad with the help of the model of a chariot.\n\n### The Chariot Analogy\n\nThe Upaniṣhads say there is a chariot, which has five horses pulling it; the horses have reins in their mouths, which are in the hands of a charioteer; a passenger is sitting at the back of the chariot. Ideally, the passenger should instruct the charioteer, who should then control the reins and guide the horses in the proper direction.\n\nHowever, in this case, the passenger has gone to sleep, and so the horses are holding sway.\n\n### Interpreting the Analogy\n\nIn this analogy, the chariot is the body, the horses are the five senses, the reins in the mouth of the horses is the mind, the charioteer is the intellect, and the passenger seated behind is the soul residing in the body.\n\nThe senses (horses) desire pleasurable things. The mind (reins) is not exercising restraint on the senses (horses). The intellect (charioteer) submits to the pull of the reins (mind).\n\nSo in the materially bound state, the bewildered soul does not direct the intellect in the proper direction. Thus, the senses decide the direction where the chariot will go.\n\nThe soul experiences the pleasures of the senses vicariously, but these do not satisfy it. Seated on this chariot, the soul (passenger) is moving around in this material world since eternity.\n\n### The Path to Liberation\n\nHowever, if the soul wakes up to its higher nature and decides to take a proactive role, it can exercise the intellect in the proper direction.\n\nThe intellect will then govern the lower self—the mind and the senses—and the chariot will move in the direction of eternal welfare.\n\nIn this way, the higher self (soul) must be used to control the lower self (senses, mind, and intellect)."

The recipients of that knowledge must appreciate its value and have faith in its authenticity. Only then will they put in the effort required to implement it practically in their lives.\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna establishes the credibility and importance of the spiritual wisdom he is bestowing on Arjun. He informs Arjun that the knowledge being imparted unto him is not newly created for the convenience of motivating him into battle. It is the same eternal science of Yog that he originally taught to Vivasvan, or Surya, Sun God.\n\n### The Descending Process of Knowledge\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis is the descending process of knowledge, where someone who is a perfect authority on the knowledge passes it down to another who wishes to know.\n\nKey aspects of the descending process include:\n\n*   The knowledge is passed down through a perfect authority to a willing disciple.\n*   The descending process is laborious, imperfect, and time-consuming.\n*   It provides instant access to the deepest secrets of a subject.\n\n### The Ascending Process of Acquiring Knowledge\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn contrast to this is the ascending process of acquiring knowledge, where one endeavors to enhance the frontiers of understanding through self-effort.\n\nKey aspects of the ascending process include:\n\n*   It is laborious, imperfect, and time-consuming.\n*   It involves self-effort to speculate about principles and reach conclusions.\n*   The validity of conclusions cannot be guaranteed.\n\n### Limitations of the Ascending Process\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe ascending process has its limitations:\n\n*   It is unsuitable for knowing the Absolute Truth.\n*   The knowledge it provides may be imperfect and subject to change over time.\n*   It requires immense self-effort, which can be time-consuming.\n\n### The Importance of the Descending Process\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe descending process, on the other hand, provides:\n\n*   Instant access to the deepest secrets of a subject.\n*   A faultless and easy way to receive knowledge.\n\n### The Role of Teachers in the Descending Process\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nA good teacher is essential to the descending process:\n\n*   They possess perfect knowledge of a subject.\n*   Their role is to pass on this knowledge to their disciple.\n\n### The Relevance of the Bhagavad Gita\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, a fundamental text in Hinduism, continues to astound people with the sagacity of its perennial wisdom that remains relevant to our daily lives even fifty centuries after it was spoken.\n\n**The Eternal Science of Yog**\n====================================\n\n### **God and the Individual Soul are Both Eternal**\n\nGod and the individual soul are both eternal, which means that the science of Yog that unites the soul and God is also eternal.\n\n### **The Impermanence of Theories**\n\nNew theories emerge over time, which can lead to the overthrowing of existing ones. This impermanence highlights the unsuitability of the ascending process for knowing the Absolute Truth.\n\n### **The Role of Divine Knowledge**\n\nDivine knowledge does not need to be created by self-effort. It is the energy of God, and has existed ever since he has existed.\n\n### **The Perennial Wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita**\n\nShree Krishna states here that the knowledge of Yog, which he is revealing to Arjun, is eternal and it was passed down in ancient times through the descending process, from Guru to disciple.\n\n### **The Ascending Process**\n\nIf we wish to learn Physics, for example, we could either try to do it by the ascending process:\n\n*   Where we speculate about its principles with our own intellect and then reach conclusions.\n*   Or, we could do it by the descending process:\n\n    *   Where we approach a good teacher of the subject.\n*   The ascending process is exceedingly time-consuming, and we may not even be able to complete the inquiry in our lifetime.\n\n### **The Descending Process**\n\nIn comparison, the descending process gives us instant access to the deepest secrets of Physics. If our teacher has perfect knowledge of Physics, then it is very straightforward:\n\n*   Simply listen to the science from him and digest what he says.\n*   The descending process provides a faultless and easy way to receive knowledge.\n\n### **Limitations of the Ascending Process in Receiving Divine Knowledge**\n\nEvery year, thousands of self-help books are released in the market:\n\n*   Which present the authors’ solutions to the problems encountered in life.\n*   These books may be helpful in a limited way.\n\n### **The Imperfections of the Ascending Process**\n\nEvery few years, a new theory comes along that overthrows the current ones.\n\n### **The Descending Process in Receiving Divine Knowledge**\n\nThis ascending process is unsuitable for knowing the Absolute Truth.\n\n### **The Role of God in Providing Divine Knowledge**\n\nDivine knowledge does not need to be created by self-effort:\n\n*   It is the energy of God,\n*   and has existed ever since he has existed.\n\n### **The Role of the Bhagavad Gita in Demonstrating the Importance of the Descending Process**\n\nAn amazing endorsement of this truism is the Bhagavad Gita itself:\n\n*   Which continues to astound people with the sagacity of its perennial wisdom that remains relevant to our daily lives even fifty centuries after it was spoken.\n\n### **The Relevance of the Bhagavad Gita in Demonstrating the Importance of the Descending Process**\n\nShree Krishna states here that the knowledge of Yog, which he is revealing to Arjun:\n\n*   Is eternal,\n*   and it was passed down in ancient times through the descending process, from Guru to disciple."

It was in such a tradition that saintly kings like Nimi and Janak understood the science of Yog. This tradition starts from God himself, who is the first Guru of the world.\n\n**The Revelation of Knowledge at the Beginning of Creation**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nGod revealed this knowledge at the beginning of creation in the heart of the first-born Brahma, and the tradition continued from him.\n\ntene brahma hṛidā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ \n(Bhāgavatam 1.1.1)[v1]\n\nThis verse from the Bhagavatam states that God revealed this knowledge at the beginning of creation, and it was passed down through generations.\n\n### The Continuation of the Tradition\n\nShree Krishna stated in the last verse that he also revealed this knowledge to the Sun God, Vivasvan, from whom the tradition continued as well.\n\n### The Loss of Knowledge Over Time\n\nHowever, the nature of this material world is such, that with the passage of time, this knowledge got lost. Materially-minded and insincere disciples interpret the teachings according to their blemished perspectives. Within a few generations, its pristine purity is contaminated.\n\n### The Reestablishment of the Tradition\n\nWhen this happens, by his causeless grace, God reestablishes the tradition for the benefit of humankind. He may do so, either by himself descending in the world, or through a great God-realized Saint, who becomes a conduit for God’s work on Earth.\n\n**The Revival of the Ancient Knowledge**\n--------------------------------------\n\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj, who is the fifth original Jagadguru in Indian history, is such a God-inspired Saint who has reestablished the ancient knowledge in modern times. When he was only thirty-four years old, the Kashi Vidvat Parishat, the supreme body of 500 Vedic scholars in the holy city of Kashi, honored him with the title of Jagadguru, or “Spiritual Master of the world.”\n\n### The Recognition as a Spiritual Master\nJagadguru Shankaracharya, Jagadguru Nimbarkacharya, Jagadguru Ramanujacharya, and Jagadguru Madhvacharya are the four previous saints who received the original title of Jagadguru.\n\nThis commentary on the Bhagavad Gita has been written based upon its insightful understanding, as revealed to me by Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj."

    "explanation": "**The Science of Yog: A Secret Imparted to Arjun**\n====================================================\n\nShree Krishna tells Arjun that the ancient science being imparted to him is an uncommonly known secret. Secrecy in the world is maintained for two reasons: either due to selfishness in keeping the truth to oneself, or to protect the abuse of knowledge. The science of Yog remains a secret, not for either of these reasons, but because it requires a qualification to be understood. That qualification is revealed in this verse as devotion.\n\n**The Qualification of Devotion**\n------------------------------\n\nDevotion to God can be practiced in any of the five sequentially higher bhāvas, or sentiments:\n\n*   **Śhānt Bhāv**: Adoring God as our King\n*   **Dāsya Bhāv**: The sentiment of servitude toward God as our Master\n*   **Sakhya Bhāv**: Considering God as our Friend\n*   **Vātsalya Bhāv**: Considering God as our Child\n*   **Mādhurya Bhāv**: Worshipping God as our Soul-beloved\n\nArjun worshipped God as his Friend, and so Shree Krishna speaks to him as his friend and devotee.\n\n**The Importance of Devotion**\n-------------------------------\n\nWithout a devotional heart, one cannot truly grasp the message of the Bhagavad Gita. This verse also invalidates the commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita written by scholars, jñānīs, yogis, tapasvīs, etc., who lack bhakti (devotion) toward God. According to this verse, since they are not devotees, they cannot comprehend the true import of the supreme science that was revealed to Arjun, and hence their commentaries are inaccurate and/or incomplete."

The president of a country sometimes decides to visit the prison, but if we see the president standing in the jail, we do not erroneously conclude that he is also a convict. We know that he is in the jail merely for an inspection. Similarly, God sometimes descends in the material world, but he is never divested of his divine attributes and powers.\n\n### Shankaracharya's Commentary\n\nShankaracharya states:\n\nyā vāsudeve anīśhvarāsarvajñāśhaṅkā mūrkhāṇāṁ tāṁ pariharan śhrī-bhagavān uvācha \n(\nŚhārīrak Bhāṣhya\non verse 4.5)[v2]\n\n### Understanding the Verse\n\nThis verse has been spoken by Shree Krishna to refute foolish people who doubt that he is not God. Non-believers argue that Shree Krishna too was born like the rest of us, and he ate, drank, slept, like we all do, and so he could not have been God. Here, Shree Krishna emphasizes the difference between the soul and God by stating that although he descends in the world innumerable times, he still remains omniscient, unlike the soul whose knowledge is finite.\n\n### Similarities and Differences Between the Soul and God\n\nThe individual soul and the Supreme Soul, God, have many similarities:\n\n- **Sat-chit-ānand**: Both are eternal, sentient, and blissful.\n- God is all-pervading.\n- God is all-powerful.\n- God is the creator of the laws of nature.\n- God is the upholder of the entire creation.\n- God is all-knowing.\n\nHowever, there are also many differences:\n\n- The soul only pervades the body it inhabits.\n- The soul does not even have the power to liberate itself from Maya without God’s grace.\n- The soul is subject to the laws of nature, whereas God creates and upholds these laws.\n- The soul is upheld by God.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Message to Arjun\n\nShree Krishna calls Arjun in this verse as \"Parantapa,\" meaning \"subduer of the enemies.\" He implies, \"Arjun, you are a valiant warrior who has slayed so many powerful enemies. Now, do not accept defeat before this doubt that has crept into your mind. Use the sword of knowledge that I am giving you to slay it and be situated in wisdom.\""

    "explanation": "**The Formless and Personal Nature of God**\n=====================================================\n\nMany people revolt at the idea of a God who possesses a form. They are more comfortable with a formless God, who is all-pervading, incorporeal, and subtle. God is definitely incorporeal and formless, but that does not mean that he cannot simultaneously have a form as well.\n\n**The All-Powerful Nature of God**\n---------------------------------\n\nSince God is all-powerful, he has the power to manifest in a form if he wishes. If someone stipulates that God cannot have a form, it means that person does not accept him as all-powerful. Thus to say, “God is formless,” is an incomplete statement. On the other hand, to say, “God manifests in a personal form,” is also only a partial truth.\n\n**The Complementarity of God's Nature**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe all-powerful God has both aspects to his divine personality—the personal form and the formless aspect. Hence, the Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:\n\n> \"God appears in both ways—as the formless \n> Brahman\n> and as the personal God.\" They are both dimensions of his personality.\n\n**The Individual Soul's Duality**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn fact, the individual soul also has these two dimensions to its existence. It is formless, and hence, when it leaves the body upon death, it cannot be seen. Yet it takes on a body—not once, but innumerable times—as it transmigrates from birth to birth. When the tiny soul is able to possess a body, can the all-powerful God not have a form? Or is it that God says, “I do not have the power to manifest in a form, and hence I am only a formless light.”\n\n**The Difference Between Material and Divine Forms**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor him to be perfect and complete, he must be both personal and formless. The difference is that while our form is created from the material energy, Maya, God’s form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya. It is thus divine, and beyond material defects.\n\n**The Implication of the Vedic Scriptures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis has been nicely stated in the Padma Purāṇ:\n\n> \"Wherever the Vedic scriptures state that God does not have a form, they imply that his form is not subject to the blemishes of the material energy; rather, it is a divine form.\"\n\n**The Complementarity of God's Forms**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn other words, the Vedic scriptures are hinting at the idea that God's form is not subject to the limitations of material energy. It is a divine, flawless form that is distinct from our mundane forms created by Maya."

When unrighteousness prevails, the creator and administrator of the world intervenes by descending and reestablishing \ndharma\n. Such a descension of God is called an \nAvatār\n.\n\n**What are Avatars?**\n--------------------\n\nThe word “Avatar” has been adopted from Sanskrit into English and is commonly used for people’s images on the media screen. In this text, we will be using it in its original Sanskrit connotation, to refer to the divine descension of God.\n\n**Number of Avatars**\n--------------------\n\nTwenty four such descensions have been listed in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam. However, the Vedic scriptures state that there are innumerable descensions of God:\n\n“Nobody can count the infinite Avatars of God since the beginning of eternity.” These Avatars are classified in four categories.\n\n**Classification of Avatars**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe classification of Avatars is as follows:\n\n### 1. Āveśhāvatār\n—when God manifests his special powers in an individual soul and acts through him.\n\n*   The sage Narad is an example of \n    Āveśhāvatār\n*   The Buddha is also an example of \n    Āveśhāvatār\n.\n\n### 2. Prābhavāvatār\n—these are the descensions of God in the personal form, where he displays some of his divine powers.\n\n*   a) Where God reveals himself only for a few moments, completes his work, and then departs.\n*   b) Where the Avatar remains on the earth for many years.\n\n#### Prābhavāvatārs: Reveal and Depart\n\n*   Example 1: Hansavatar - God manifested before the Kumaras, answered their question, and left.\n*   Example 2: Ved Vyas - wrote the eighteen Puranas and the Mahabharat, and divided the Vedas into four parts.\n\n### 3. Vaibhavāvatār\n—when God descends in his divine form, and manifests more of his divine powers.\n\n*   Matsyavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahavatar are all examples of \n    Vaibhavāvatār\n.\n\n### 4. Parāvasthāvatār\n—when God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form.\n\n*   Shree Krishna, Shree Ram, and Nrisinghavatar are all \n    Parāvasthāvatār\n.\n\n**Implication of Classification**\n---------------------------------\n\nThis classification does not imply that any one \nAvatār\n is bigger than the other. Ved Vyas, who is himself an \nAvatār\n, clearly states this:\n\n“All the descensions of God are replete with all divine powers; they are all perfect and complete.” Hence, we should not differentiate one Avatar as bigger and another as smaller.\n\n**Manifesting Powers**\n---------------------\n\nIn each descension, God manifests his powers based on the objectives he wishes to accomplish during that particular descension. The remaining powers reside latently within the Avatar. Hence, the above classifications were created."

The formless aspect of God is very difficult to worship.\n\n**Examples from History**\n-------------------------\n\n*   The descension of Lord Krishna 5,000 years ago has provided billions of souls with an easy basis for devotion.\n*   The Ramayan has provided a popular basis for devotion for innumerable centuries.\n\n**The Descension of Lord Ram**\n---------------------------\n\n*   The TV show, Ramayan, first began airing on Indian national television on Sunday mornings.\n*   All the streets of India would become empty as people were glued to their television sets to see the leelas on the screen.\n*   This reveals how Lord Ram's descension provided the basis for devotion to billions of souls in history.\n\n**A Quote from the Ramayan**\n-----------------------------\n\n`rām eka tāpasa tiya tārī, nāma koṭi khala kumati sudhārī [v7]`\n\n\"In his descension period, Lord Ram helped only one Ahalya (Sage Gautam's wife, whom Lord Ram released from the body of stone). However, since then, by chanting the divine name 'Ram,' billions of fallen souls have elevated themselves.\"\n\n**A Deeper Meaning**\n--------------------\n\nGod descends to establish the dharma of devotion by providing souls with his names, forms, pastimes, virtues, abodes, and associates. These provide the souls with an easy basis for devotion and help them purify their minds.\n\n**The Role of Liberated Saints**\n-------------------------------\n\nAlong with God, some liberated Saints descend and pretend to be miscreants. They help facilitate God's divine pastimes by opposing and fighting with them. These Saints are divine personalities who cannot be killed by anyone else.\n\n**The Protection of the Righteous**\n---------------------------------\n\nMany souls have become sufficiently elevated in their sādhanā (spiritual practice) to qualify to meet God face-to-face. When Shree Krishna descended in the world, these eligible souls got their first opportunity to participate in God's divine pastimes.\n\n**Examples from the Mahabharat**\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Some gopīs (cowherd women of Vrindavan, where Shree Krishna manifested his pastimes) were liberated souls who had descended from the divine abode to assist in Shree Krishna's leelas.\n*   Other gopīs were materially bound souls who got their first chance to meet and serve God, and participate in his leelas.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe deeper meaning of the verse is that God descends to establish the dharma of devotion by providing souls with his names, forms, pastimes, virtues, abodes, and associates. This provides the souls with an easy basis for devotion and helps them purify their minds.\n\n**Literal or Metaphorical Interpretation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIt is not wrong if someone wishes to cognize the verse more literally or metaphorically."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Devotion Toward Lord Krishna**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Importance of Devotional Remembrance\n\n4.9 Understand this verse in the light of the previous one. Our mind gets cleansed by engaging it in devotional remembrance of God. This devotion can either be toward the formless aspect of God or toward his personal form.\n\n#### Devotion Toward the Formless and Personal Forms\n\nDevotion toward the formless is intangible and nebulous to most people. They find nothing to focus upon or feel connected with during such devotional meditation. Devotion to the personal form of God is tangible and simple. Such devotion requires divine sentiments toward the personality of God.\n\n#### Developing Divine Sentiments\n\nFor people to engage in devotion to Shree Krishna, they must develop divine feelings toward his names, form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates. For example, people purify their minds by worshipping stone deities because they harbor the divine sentiments that God resides in these deities. It is these sentiments that purify the devotee’s mind.\n\n### Quotes from Devotional Texts\n\nThe progenitor Manu says:\n\n\"God resides neither in wood nor in stone, but in a devotional heart. Hence, worship the deity with loving sentiments.\"\n\nSimilarly, if we wish to engage in devotion toward Lord Krishna, we must learn to harbor divine sentiments toward his leelas.\n\n#### The Misinterpretation of Devotional Texts\n\nThose commentators who give a figurative interpretation to the Mahabharat and the Bhagavad Gita, do grave injustice by destroying the basis of people’s faith in devotion toward Shree Krishna. In this verse, Shree Krishna has emphasized the need for divine sentiments toward his pastimes, for enhancing our devotion.\n\n#### Understanding Divine Actions\n\nTo develop such divine feelings, we must understand the difference between God’s actions and ours. We materially bound souls have not yet attained divine bliss, and hence the longing of our soul is not yet satiated. Thus, our actions are motivated by self-interest and the desire for personal fulfillment.\n\nHowever, God’s actions have no personal motive because he is perfectly satiated by the infinite bliss of his own personality. He does not need to achieve further personal bliss by performing actions. Therefore, whatever he does is for the welfare of the materially conditioned souls.\n\n#### The Concept of Leelas\n\nSuch divine actions that God performs are termed as leelas while the actions we perform are called work.\n\n### The Nature of God’s Birth\n\nSimilarly, God’s birth is also divine, and unlike ours, it does not take place from a mother’s womb. The all-Blissful God has no requirement to hang upside down in a mother’s womb.\n\nThe Bhāgavatam states:\n\n\"When Shree Krishna manifested upon birth before Vasudev and Devaki, he was in his four-armed Vishnu form.\"\n\nThis full-sized form could definitely not have resided in Devaki’s womb. However, to create in her the feeling that he was there, by his Yogmaya power, he simply kept expanding Devaki’s womb. Finally, he manifested from the outside, revealing that he had never been inside her:\n\n\"As the moon manifests in its full glory in the night sky, similarly the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna manifested before Devaki and Vasudev.\"\n\nThis is the divine nature of God’s birth. If we can develop faith in the divinity of his pastimes and birth, then we will be able to easily engage in devotion to his personal form, and attain the supreme destination."

    "explanation": "**Purifying the Mind Through Devotion**\n=====================================================\n\nIn the previous verse, Lord Krishna explained that those who truly know the divine nature of his birth and pastimes attain him. He now confirms that legions of human beings in all ages became God-realized by this means. They achieved this goal by purifying their minds through devotion.\n\n**A Clean Heart**\n-----------------\n\nShree Aurobindo put it very nicely: “You must keep the temple of the heart clean, if you wish to install therein the living presence.” The Bible states: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” (Matthew 5.8) [v11]\n\n**How Does the Mind Get Purified?**\n--------------------------------------\n\nActually, attachment is the cause of both fear and anger. Fear arises out of apprehension that the object of our attachment will be snatched away from us. And anger arises when there is an obstruction in attaining the object of our attachment. Attachment is thus the root cause of the mind getting dirty.\n\n**The Three Modes of Material Nature**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis world of Maya consists of the three modes of material nature— **Sattva**, **Rajas**, and **Tamas** (goodness, passion, and ignorance). All objects and personalities in the world come within the realm of these three modes. When we attach our mind to a material object or person, our mind too becomes affected by the three modes. Instead, when we absorb the same mind in God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, such devotion purifies the mind.\n\n**Detachment and Devotion**\n---------------------------\n\nThus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord. Hence, the Ramayan states:\n\nprema bhagati jala binu raghurāī, abhiantara mala \nkabahuñ na jāī\n\n“Without devotion to God, the dirt of the mind will not be washed away.” Even the ardent propagator of **Jnana Yog**, Shankaracharya, stated:\n\nśhuddhayati hi nāntarātmā kṛiṣhṇapadāmbhoja bhaktimṛite \n(Prabodh Sudhākar)[v13]\n\n“Without engaging in devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, the mind will not be cleansed.”\n\n**A Question of Favoritism**\n------------------------------\n\nOn reading the previous verse, a question may arise whether Lord Krishna is partial in bestowing his grace upon those who absorb their minds in him versus the worldly-minded souls. The Supreme Lord addresses this in the next verse."

    "explanation": "**Verse Explanation**\n======================\n\n4.11 Here, Lord Krishna states that he reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.\n\n**Reciprocity of Lord Krishna**\n-----------------------------\n\nLord Krishna states that he reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him. For those who deny the existence of God, he meets them in the form of the law of karma—he sits inside their hearts, notes their actions, and dispenses the results. But such atheists too cannot get away from serving him; they are obliged to serve God’s material energy, Maya, in its various apparitions, as wealth, luxuries, relatives, prestige, etc. Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed.\n\n**Serving Lord Krishna**\n----------------------\n\nOn the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Words**\n------------------------\n\nShree Krishna uses the word `bhajāmi`, which means “to serve.” He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love.\n\n**Selfless Love**\n-----------------\n\nAnd when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love. Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman:\n\nekaikasyopakārasya prāṇān dāsyāmi te kape\nśheṣhasyehopakārāṁ bhavām ṛiṇino vayaṁ\n\n**Vālmīki Ramayan**\n---------------------\n\n“O Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you. For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.” In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.\n\n**Why Worship Celestial Gods?**\n---------------------------------\n\nIf God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead? He explains in the following verse."

    "verseNum": "4.12",
    "explanation": "**The Celestial Gods: A Misunderstood Concept**\n\n4.12\nPersons who seek worldly gain worship the celestial gods and seek boons from them. The boons the celestial gods bestow are material and temporary, and they are given only by virtue of the power they have received from the Supreme Lord. There is a beautiful instructive story in this regard:\n\n**The Story of Saint Farid and Emperor Akbar**\n\nSaint Farid went to the court of Emperor Akbar, a powerful king in Indian history. He waited in the court for an audience, while Akbar was praying in the next room. Farid peeped into the room to see what was going on, and was amused to hear Akbar praying to God for more powerful army, a bigger treasure chest, and success in battle. Without disturbing the king, Farid returned to the royal court.\n\n**A Conversation with Emperor Akbar**\n\nAfter completing his prayers, Akbar came and gave Farid audience. He asked the great Sage if there was anything that he wanted. Farid replied, “I came to ask the Emperor for things I required for my āśhram. However, I find that the Emperor is himself a beggar before the Lord. Then why should I ask him for any favors, and not directly from the Lord himself?”\n\n**The True Nature of the Celestial Gods**\n\nThe celestial gods give boons only by the powers bestowed upon them by the Supreme Lord. People with small understanding approach them, but those who are intelligent realize that there is no point in going to the intermediary and they approach the Supreme Lord for the fulfillment of their aspirations.\n\n**The Various Kinds of People**\n\nPeople are of various kinds, possessing higher and lower aspirations. Shree Krishna now mentions four categories of qualities and works.\n\n### The Four Categories of Qualities and Works\n\nShree Krishna mentions the following four categories of qualities and works:\n\n*   **Worshiping the Celestial Gods**: These are people who seek worldly gain and worship the celestial gods.\n*   **Seeking Boons from Celestial Gods**: These are individuals who approach the celestial gods for material and temporary boons.\n*   **Seeking Boons Directly from the Supreme Lord**: These are people who, understanding the true nature of the celestial gods, approach the Supreme Lord for the fulfillment of their aspirations.\n*   **Realizing Their Own Power**: These are individuals who, having a deeper understanding of the world, realize that they possess their own power and do not need to rely on intermediaries."

    "explanation": "**The Vedas and Vedic Philosophy**\n=====================================\n\n4.13 The Vedas classify people into four categories of occupations, not according to their birth, but according to their natures. Such varieties of occupations exist in every society. Even in communist nations where equality is the overriding principle, the diversity in human beings cannot be smothered. There are the philosophers who are the communist party think-tanks, there are the military men who protect the country, there are the farmers who engage in agriculture, and there are the factory workers.\n\nThe Vedic philosophy explains this variety in a more scientific manner. It states that the material energy is constituted of three guṇas (modes):\n\n*   **Sattva Guṇa (Mode of Goodness)**\n    The Brahmins are those who have a preponderance of the mode of goodness. They are predisposed toward teaching and worship.\n*   **Rajo Guṇa (Mode of Passion)**\n    The Kshatriyas are those who have a preponderance of the mode of passion mixed with a smaller amount of the mode of goodness. They are inclined toward administration and management.\n*   **Tamo Guṇa (Mode of Ignorance)**\n    The Vaishyas are those who possess the mode of passion mixed with some mode of ignorance. Accordingly, they form the business and agricultural class.\n*   **The Shudras (Working Class)**\n    The Shudras, who are predominated by the mode of ignorance. They form the working class.\n\nThis classification was neither meant to be according to birth, nor was it unchangeable. Shree Krishna explains in this verse that the classification of the Varṇāśhram system was according to people’s qualities and activities.\n\n**The Non-Dualistic Nature of God**\n-----------------------------------\n\nAlthough God is the creator of the scheme of the world, yet he is the non-doer. This is similar to the rain. Just as rain water falls equally on the forest, yet from some seeds huge banyan trees sprout, from other seeds beautiful flowers bloom, and from some thorny bushes emerge. The rain, which is impartial, is not answerable for this difference.\n\nIn the same way, God provides the souls with the energy to act, but they are free in determining what they wish to do with it; God is not responsible for their actions.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   The Vedas classify people into four categories of occupations based on their natures.\n*   These categories are not fixed and can change over time.\n*   The classification is based on the mode of goodness, passion, and ignorance.\n*   God provides the energy for action but is not responsible for it."

They give up actions physically, but their mind continues to contemplate upon the objects of the senses. Such persons may appear to be inactive, but their lethargic idleness is actually sinful action.\n\nExample:\nWhen Arjun suggested that he wishes to shy away from his duty of fighting the war, Shree Krishna explained to him that it would be a sin, and he would go to the hellish regions for such inaction.\n\n### Inaction in Action\n\n#### Karm Yogi's Perspective\n\nThere is another kind of inaction performed by karm yogis. They execute their social duties without attachment to results, dedicating the fruits of their actions to God. Although engaged in all kinds of activities, they are not entangled in karmic reactions, since they have no motive for personal enjoyment.\n\n**Historical Examples**\n\nThere were many great kings in Indian history—Dhruv, Prahlad, Yudhisthir, Prithu, and Ambarish—who discharged their kingly duties to the best of their abilities, and yet because their minds were not entangled in material desires, their actions were termed Akarm, or inaction.\n\n**Alternative Name: Karm Yog**\n\nAnother name for Akarm is Karm Yog, which has been discussed in detail in the previous two chapters as well."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of the Soul**\n\n### Understanding the Relationship Between the Soul and the Material World\n\nThe soul, being a tiny part of God who is an ocean of bliss, naturally seeks bliss for itself. However, covered by the material energy, the soul mistakenly identifies itself with the material body.\n\n**The Consequences of Misidentification**\n\nIn this ignorance, it performs actions to attain bliss from the world of matter. Since these actions are motivated by the desire for sensual and mental enjoyment, they bind the soul in karmic reactions.\n\n### The Path to Enlightenment\n\nIn contrast, when the soul is illumined with divine knowledge, it realizes that the bliss it seeks will be attained not from the objects of the senses, but in loving service to God.\n\n**The Divine Command**\n\nIt then strives to perform every action for the pleasure of God. According to the Bhagavad Gita (9.27), \"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever you bestow as a gift, and whatever austerities you perform, O son of Kunti, do them as an offering to me.\"\n\n**The Result of Enlightened Action**\n\nSince such an enlightened soul renounces selfish actions for material pleasures and dedicates all actions to God, the works performed produce no karmic reactions. They are said to be burnt in the fire of divine knowledge.\n\n### The Bliss of Devotion\n\nThis enlightened state is characterized by a deep understanding of the true nature of reality and a sense of detachment from the material world. The soul, now free from the bindings of ignorance, is able to experience the true bliss that it seeks."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Akarm**\n==========================\n\nActions cannot be classified by external appearances. It is the state of the mind that determines what is inaction and action. The minds of enlightened persons are absorbed in God. Being fully satisfied in devotional union with him, they look upon God as their only refuge and do not depend upon external supports.\n\n**The State of Akarm**\n----------------------\n\nIn this state of mind, all their actions are termed as *akarm*, or inactions. This concept is beautifully illustrated by a story from the Puranas.\n\n**The Story of Gopis and Sage Durvasa**\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe *gopīs* (cowherd women) of Vrindavan once kept a fast. The ceremony of breaking the fast required them to feed a sage. Shree Krishna advised them to feed Sage Durvasa, the elevated ascetic, who lived on the other side of River Yamuna.\n\n### Preparing for the Journey\n\nThe *gopīs* prepared a delicious feast and started off, but found the river was very turbulent that day, and no boatman was willing to ferry them across.\n\n### Requesting for Help\n\nThe *gopīs* asked Shree Krishna for a solution. He said, “Tell River Yamuna that if Shree Krishna is an *akhaṇḍ brahmacharī* (perfectly celibate since birth), it should give them way.” The *gopīs* started laughing, because they felt that Shree Krishna used to dote upon them, and so there was no question of his being an *akhaṇḍ brahmacharī*.\n\n### The River's Response\n\nNevertheless, when they requested River Yamuna in that manner, the river gave them way and a bridge of flowers manifested for their passage across.\n\n### Meeting with Sage Durvasa\n\nThe *gopīs* were astonished. They went across to the hermitage of Sage Durvasa. They requested him to accept the delicious meal they had brought for him.\n\n### The Ascetic's Response\n\nBeing an ascetic, he ate only a small portion, which disappointed the *gopīs*. So, Durvasa decided to fulfill their expectations, and using his mystic powers, he ate everything they had brought.\n\n### The *Gopīs*' Amazement\n\nThe *gopīs* were amazed to see him eat so much, but were very pleased that he had done justice to their cooking.\n\n### Requesting for Help Again\n\nThe *gopīs* now asked Durvasa for help to cross the Yamuna and return to the other side. He replied, “Tell River Yamuna that if Durvasa has not eaten anything today except *doob* (a kind of grass which was the only thing Durvasa used to eat), the river should give way.”\n\n### The *Gopīs*' Amazement Again\n\nThe *gopīs* again started laughing, for they had seen him eat such an extravagant meal. Yet to their utmost surprise, when they beseeched River Yamuna in that manner, the river again gave them way.\n\n### The Secret Behind the Illusion\n\nThe *gopīs* asked Shree Krishna the secret behind what had happened. He explained that while God and the Saints appear to engage in material activities externally, internally they are always transcendentally situated. Thus, even while doing all kinds of actions, they are still considered to be non-doers.\n\n### The Guru's Inner State\n\nAlthough interacting with the *gopīs* externally, Shree Krishna was an *akhaṇḍ brahmacharī* internally. And though Durvasa ate the delectable meal offered by the *gopīs*, internally his mind only tasted the *doob* grass.\n\n### The Illustration of Akarm\n--------------------------------\n\nBoth these were illustrations of inaction in action."

    "explanation": "**Embracing Dualities: A Key to Life's Success**\n=====================================================\n\nJust like there are two sides to a coin, so too God created this world full of dualities—there is day and night, sweet and sour, hot and cold, rain and drought, etc. The same rose bush has a beautiful flower and also an ugly thorn. Life too brings its share of dualities—happiness and distress, victory and defeat, fame and notoriety.\n\n**The Reality of Dualities**\n---------------------------\n\nWhile living in this world, nobody can hope to neutralize the dualities to have only positive experiences. Then how can we successfully deal with the dualities that come our way in life?\n\n**The Solution: Equanimity and Detachment**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe solution is to take these dualities in stride, by learning to rise above them in equipoise in all situations. This happens when we develop detachment to the fruits of our actions, concerning ourselves merely with doing our duty in life without yearning for the results.\n\n**The Power of Detachment**\n-------------------------\n\nWhen we perform works for the pleasure of God, we see both positive and negative fruits of those works as the will of God, and joyfully accept both.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n-----------------\n\n*   Dualities are an inherent part of life.\n*   Detachment to the fruits of our actions is key to dealing with dualities.\n*   Learning to rise above dualities in equipoise can help us navigate life's challenges.\n*   Performing works for the pleasure of God helps us accept both positive and negative outcomes with equanimity."

    "explanation": "**The Unity of God and Humanity**\n=====================================\n\n### Factually, the Objects of the World are Made from Maya\n\nFactually, the objects of the world are made from *Maya*, the material energy of God. Energy is both one with its energetic and also different from it. For example, light is the energy of fire. It can be considered as different from the fire, because it exists outside it. But it can also be reckoned as a part of the fire itself.\n\nHence, when the rays of the sun enter the room through a window, people say, “The sun has come.” Here, they are bundling the sunrays with the sun. The energy is both distinct from the energetic and yet a part of it.\n\n**The Soul as Energy**\n\nThe soul too is the energy of God—it is a spiritual energy, called *jīva śhakti*. Shree Krishna states this in verse 7.5.\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu stated:\n\njīva-tattva śhakti, kṛṣṇa-tattva śhaktimān\ngītā-viṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa\n\n(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela, 7.117)[v19]\n\n*“Lord Krishna is the energetic and the soul is his energy. This has been stated in *Bhagavad Gita*, Viṣhṇu Purāṇ, etc.”*\n\nThus, the soul is also simultaneously one with and different from God. Hence, those whose minds are fully absorbed in God-consciousness see the whole world in its unity with God as non-different from him.\n\n**Unity of God and Humanity**\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:\n\nsarva-bhūteṣhu yaḥ paśhyed bhagavad-bhāvam ātmanaḥ\nbhūtāni bhagavatyātmanyeṣha bhāgavatottamaḥ\n\n(11.2.45)[v20]\n\n*“One who sees God everywhere and in all beings is the highest spiritualist.”*\n\nFor such advanced spiritualists whose minds are completely absorbed in God-consciousness, the person making the sacrifice, the object of the sacrifice, the instruments of the sacrifice, the sacrificial fire, and the act of sacrifice, are all perceived as non-different from God.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nHaving explained the spirit in which sacrifice is to be done, Lord Krishna now relates the different kinds of sacrifice people perform in this world for purification.\n\nNote: I've used a combination of headings, subheadings, and quotes to format the text in markdown.

    "explanation": "**Understanding Sacrifice**\n=========================\n\n**The Importance of Divine Consciousness in Sacrifice**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSacrifice, or yajña, should be performed in divine consciousness as an offering to the Supreme Lord. However, people vary in their understanding, and hence perform sacrifice in different manners with dissimilar consciousness.\n\n**Types of Sacrifice**\n----------------------\n\n### Material Motivation\n\nPersons with lesser understanding, and wanting material rewards, make offerings to the celestial gods. This is a common phenomenon where individuals prioritize self-interest over spiritual growth.\n\n### Spiritual Growth\n\nOthers with deeper understanding of the meaning of yajña offer their own selves as sacrifice to the Supreme. This is called ātma samarpaṇ, or ātmāhutī, or offering one’s soul to God.\n\n**Quote from Yogi Shri Krishna Prem**\n--------------------------------------\n\n\"In this world of dust and din, whenever one makes ātmāhutī in the flame of divine love, there is an explosion, which is grace, for no true ātmāhutī can ever go in vain.\" - Yogi Shri Krishna Prem\n\n**The Process of Offering One’s Self as Sacrifice**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuch surrender has six aspects to it, which have been explained in verse 18.66.

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Fire and Spiritual Practices**\n=====================================================\n\n4.26 Fire transforms the nature of things consigned into it. In external ritualistic Vedic sacrifices, it physically consumes oblations offered to it. In the internal practice of spirituality, fire is symbolic. The fire of self-discipline burns the desires of the senses.\n\n**Two Approaches to Spiritual Elevation**\n----------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna distinguishes between two diametrically opposite approaches to spiritual elevation. One is the path of negation of the senses, which is followed in the practice of haṭha yog. In this type of yajña (sacrifice), the actions of the senses are suspended, except for the bare maintenance of the body. The mind is completely withdrawn from the senses and made introvertive, by force of will-power.\n\n**Haṭha Yog: A Path of Negation**\n------------------------------\n\n*   In this type of yajña, the senses are suspended, except for the bare maintenance of the body.\n*   The mind is completely withdrawn from the senses and made introvertive, by force of will-power.\n*   This path is often followed for those who are looking to transcend the material world and focus on their inner selves.\n\n**Bhakti Yog: A Path of Devotion**\n---------------------------------\n\nOpposite to this is the practice of bhakti yog. In this second type of yajña, the senses are made to behold the glory of the Creator that manifests in every atom of his creation. The senses no longer remain as instruments for material enjoyment; rather they are sublimated to perceive God in everything.\n\n**Understanding Bhakti Yog**\n-------------------------\n\nShree Krishna says:\n\n\"Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya\nArjun, know me to be the taste in water.\"\n\nIn essence, this verse means that Bhakti Yogis practice to behold God through all their senses, in everything they see, hear, taste, feel, and smell. This yajña of devotion is simpler than the path of haṭha yog; it is joyous to perform, and involves a smaller risk of downfall from the path.\n\n**A Simpler yet Joyous Path**\n------------------------------\n\nJust as a bicycle can be stopped by turning the handle to the left or right, so too can the path of bhakti yog be followed with ease. This approach involves a smaller risk of downfall from the path, making it more accessible to those who are looking to cultivate devotion and spirituality in their lives."

    "explanation": "**Discrimination Yog: A Path to Self-Knowledge**\n====================================================\n\n### Overview of Discrimination Yog\n\nThe path of discrimination, or jñāna yog, is a philosophical approach that utilizes knowledge to withdraw the senses from the world. This practice is rooted in the understanding that the self (or individual identity) is distinct from the body, mind, intellect, and ego.\n\n**Key Principles of Discrimination Yog**\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   **Withdrawal of Senses**: The practice involves withdrawing the senses from the world, allowing for a deeper contemplation on the nature of reality.\n*   **Deep Contemplation**: Through the practice of discrimination, yogis engage in deep contemplation upon the illusory nature of the world and the identity of the self.\n*   **Meditation on Self-Knowledge**: The mind is engaged in meditation upon the self, fostering a deeper understanding of its true identity.\n*   **Aids to Contemplation**: Chanting aphorisms such as \"tattvamasi\" (I am That) and \"ahaṁ brahmāsmi\" (I am the Supreme Entity) serves as a catalyst for contemplation.\n\n**Examples of Discrimination Yog Aphorisms**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   \"tattvamasi I am That\" (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 6.8.7)\n*   \"ahaṁ brahmāsmi I am the Supreme Entity\" (Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad 1.4.10)\n\n### Challenges and Advantages of Discrimination Yog\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Challenging Path**: The practice of discrimination yog is considered a difficult path, requiring a determined and trained intellect.\n*   **Advanced Stage of Renunciation**: According to the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (11.20.7), success in this practice is only possible for those who have reached an advanced stage of renunciation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nThe practice of discrimination yog offers a profound path to self-knowledge, allowing individuals to cultivate a deeper understanding of their true identity. By withdrawing the senses from the world and engaging in deep contemplation, yogis can foster a profound connection with their own self."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Concept of Yajñas**\n\nIn the context of Hindu philosophy, yajñas refer to various forms of sacrifices that can be performed by individuals to purify their minds and souls. Shree Krishna explains the concept of yajñas in verse 4.28, highlighting three such types that can be performed.\n\n### Dravya Yajña\n\nDravya yajña refers to the sacrifice of wealth. Those who are inclined toward earning wealth and donating it in charity toward a divine cause engage in large and complicated business endeavors, yet their inner motivation remains to serve God with the wealth they earn. In this manner, they offer their propensity for earning money as sacrifice to God in devotion.\n\n**Example Quote**\n— John Wesley, British Preacher and Founder of the Methodist Church\n\"Make all you can. Save all you can. Give all you can.\"\n\n### Yog Yajña\n\nYog yajña refers to the sacrifice of physical and mental discipline. In Indian philosophy, the Yog Darśhan is one of the six philosophical treatises written by six learned sages. The Patañjali Yog Darśhan describes an eight-fold path, called aṣhṭāṅg yog, for spiritual advancement. Some people find this path attractive and practice it as sacrifice.\n\n**Key Point**\nPatañjali Yog Darśhan clearly states that to attain perfection in Yoga, one must surrender to God.\n— Patañjali Yog Darśhan (2.45)\n\n### Jñāna Yajña\n\nJñāna yajña refers to the sacrifice of knowledge. Some persons are inclined toward the cultivation of knowledge, which finds its perfect employment in the study of scriptures for enhancing one's understanding and love for God.\n\n**Key Point**\nTrue knowledge is that which increases our devotion to God.\n— Bhāgavatam 4.29.49 (sā vidyā tanmatiryayā)\n\n### Benefits of Jñāna Yajña\n\nWhen persons inclined toward aṣhṭaṅg yog learn to love God, they offer their yogic practice as yajña in the fire of devotion. An example of this is the yogic system \"Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog,\" where physical postures are practiced as yajña to God, along with the chanting of his divine names. Such a combination of yogic postures along with devotion results in physical, mental, and spiritual purification of the practitioner."

    "explanation": "**The True Nature of Devotion**\n=====================================\n\n4.33 Shree Krishna now puts the previously described sacrifices in proper perspective. He tells Arjun that it is good to do physical acts of devotion, but not good enough. Ritualistic ceremonies, fasts, mantra chants, holy pilgrimages, are all fine, but if they are not performed with knowledge, they remain mere physical activities.\n\n### The Insufficiency of Physical Acts\n\nMany people chant God’s name on rosary beads, sit in recitations of the scriptures, visit holy places, and perform worship ceremonies, with the belief that the physical act itself is sufficient for liberating them from material bondage. However, Saint Kabir rejects this idea very eloquently:\n\n```v27\n“O spiritual aspirant, you have been rotating the chanting beads for many ages, but the mischief of the mind has not ceased. Now put those beads down, and rotate the beads of the mind.”\n```\n\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj adds:\n\n```v28\n“Bandhan aur mokṣha kā, kāraṇ manahi bakhān\nYāte kauniu bhakti karu, karu man te haridhyān\n(Bhakti Shatak verse 19)\n```\n\nTranslated, this means:\n\n“The cause of bondage and liberation is the mind. Whatever form of devotion you do, engage your mind in meditating upon God.”\n\n### The Importance of Knowledge\n\nDevotional sentiments are nourished by the cultivation of knowledge. To illustrate this, let us consider a birthday party analogy:\n\nImagine it is your birthday party, and people are coming and handing you gifts. Someone comes and gives you a ragged bag. You look at it disdainfully, thinking it is insignificant in comparison to the other wonderful gifts you have received.\n\nSomeone requests you to look inside the bag. You open it and find a stack of one hundred notes of $100 denomination. You immediately hug the bag to your chest, and say, “This is the best gift I have received.” Knowledge of its contents developed love for the object.\n\nSimilarly, cultivating knowledge of God and our relationship with him nurtures devotional sentiments. Hence, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that sacrifices performed in knowledge are superior to the sacrifice of material things.\n\n### Acquiring Knowledge\n\nShree Krishna now explains the process of acquiring knowledge:\n\nHe teaches us that true devotion can only be achieved by engaging our minds in meditation upon God. This means putting aside mere physical activities and cultivating knowledge of the divine.\n\nTo develop this knowledge, we must be willing to question our assumptions and seek truth. We must also be open to new ideas and perspectives, recognizing that the path to liberation is not a straightforward one.\n\nUltimately, it is our minds that will decide whether we remain bound or free. By cultivating knowledge and engaging our minds in devotion, we can break free from the cycle of rebirth and attain true liberation."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of a Spiritual Master**\n=====================================================\n\nOn hearing that sacrifice should be performed in knowledge, the natural question that follows is, how can we obtain spiritual knowledge? Shree Krishna gives the answer in this verse. He says:\n\n### Three Guidelines for Spiritual Growth\n\n1. Approach a spiritual master.\n2. Inquire from him submissively.\n3. Render service to him.\n\n**The Limitations of Self-Contemplation**\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Absolute Truth cannot be understood merely by our own contemplation. The Bhāgavatam states:\n\n> anādyavidyā yuktasya puruṣhasyātma vedanam\n> svato na sambhavād anyas tattva-jño jñāna-do bhavet\n>\n> (11.22.10)[v29]\n>\n> “The intellect of the soul is clouded by ignorance from endless lifetimes. Covered with nescience, the intellect cannot overcome its ignorance simply by its own effort. One needs to receive knowledge from a God-realized Saint who knows the Absolute Truth.”\n\n**The Vedic Adherence to the Guru**\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe Vedic scriptures advise us repeatedly on the importance of the Guru on the spiritual path.\n\n> āchāryavān puruṣho veda\n>\n> (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 6.14.2)[v30]\n>\n> “Only through a Guru can you understand the Vedas.”\n\n**The Pañcadaśhī's Advice**\n---------------------------\n\nThe Pañcadaśhī states:\n\n> tatpādāmburu hadvandva sevā nirmala chetasām\n> sukhabodhāya tattvasya viveko ’yaṁ vidhīyate\n>\n> (1.2)[v31]\n>\n> “Serve the Guru with a pure mind, giving up doubts. He will then bring you great happiness by bestowing knowledge of the scriptures and discrimination.”\n\n**The Liberating Power of a Guru**\n-----------------------------------\n\nJagadguru Shankaracharya stated:\n\n> yāvat gururna kartavyo tāvanmuktirna labhyate\n>\n> [v32] “Until you surrender to a Guru you cannot be liberated from the material energy.”\n\n**The Gracious Gift of a True Guru**\n--------------------------------------\n\nOne of the most magnanimous graces of God is when he brings the soul in contact with a true Guru. However, the process of transfer of spiritual knowledge from the teacher to the student is very different from that of material knowledge.\n\nSecular education does not require deep respect for the teacher. The transmission of knowledge can be purchased simply by paying the teacher’s fees. However, spiritual edification is not imparted to the student by a mechanical teaching process, nor is it purchased for a price. It is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Guru’s grace, when the disciple develops humility, and the Guru is pleased with the service attitude of the disciple.\n\n**The Humble Heart**\n--------------------\n\nThat is why Prahlad Maharaj said:\n\n> naiṣhāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṂ spṛiśhatyanarthāpagamo yadarthaḥ\n> mahīyasāṁ pāda rajo ’bhiṣhekaṂ niṣhkiñchanānāṁ na vṛiṇīta yāvat\n>\n> (Bhāgavatam 7.5.32)[v33]\n>\n> “Until we bathe ourselves in the dust of the lotus feet of a Saint, we can never have an experience of the transcendental platform.”\n\n**The Three Guidelines for Spiritual Growth**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse Shree Krishna mentions the need for approaching a Guru with reverence, inquiring about the Truth from him with humility, and pleasing him by rendering service.\n\n### To Succeed in Spiritual Growth:\n\n*   Approach a spiritual master.\n*   Inquire from him submissively.\n*   Render service to him."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Knowledge**\n=========================\n\n*   **A Small Spark Can Become a Major Conflagration**\n\n    Even a spark of fire has the potential to become a major conflagration and burn down a huge heap of combustible material. In 1666, the Great Fire of London began as only a little flame in a small bakery, but as it grew it consigned to flames 13,200 houses, 87 churches, and most of the city offices.\n\n*   **Our Collective Karma**\n\n    We too have a heap of karmas attached to each of us, consisting of the reactions of the sinful and righteous deeds performed by us over infinite lifetimes. If we endeavor to exhaust these karmas by reaping their results, it will take many more lifetimes, and in the meantime further karmas will accumulate in an endless process.\n\n*   **The Endless Cycle of Karma**\n\n    But Shree Krishna assures Arjun that knowledge has the power to burn our heap of karmas in this lifetime itself. That is because knowledge of the soul and its relationship with God leads us to surrender to him.\n\n*   **The Liberation from Material Bondage**\n\n    When we surrender to God, he burns our stockpile of endless lifetimes of karmas and releases us from material bondage."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Knowledge**\n\nKnowledge has the power to purify, elevate, liberate, and unite a person with God. It is thus supremely sublime and pure. But a distinction needs to be made between two kinds of knowledge—theoretical information and practical realization.\n\n**The Limitations of Theoretical Knowledge**\n\nThere is one kind of knowledge that is acquired by reading the scriptures and hearing from the Guru. This theoretical information is insufficient by itself. It is just as if someone has memorized a cookbook but has never entered the kitchen. Such theoretical knowledge of cooking does not help in satiating one’s hunger.\n\n**Practical Realization**\n\nSimilarly, one may acquire theoretical knowledge on the topics of the soul, God, Maya, karma, jñāna, and bhakti from the Guru, but that by itself does not make a person God-realized. When one practices sādhanā in accordance with the theory, it results in purification of the mind. Then, from within one gets realization of the nature of the self and its relationship with God.\n\n**The Sage Patañjali's Wisdom**\n\nThe Sage Patañjali states:\n\n“śhrutānumāna-prajñābhyām anya-viṣhayā viśheṣhārthatvāt\n(Yog Darśhan 1.49)[v36]”\n\n“The knowledge attained by realization from within through the practice of Yog is far superior to theoretical knowledge of the scriptures.” Such realized knowledge is being extolled by Shree Krishna as the purest sublime thing."

    "explanation": "**Faith in the Context of Knowledge**\n\n4.39 Shree Krishna now introduces the concept of faith in the context of knowledge. Not all spiritual truths are immediately perceptible; some of them can only be experienced after having attained sufficient elevation on the path. If we only accept what we can presently verify or comprehend, we will be bereft of the higher spiritual secrets.\n\n**Importance of Faith**\n\nFaith helps us accept what we cannot understand at present. It is essential to distinguish between blind faith and genuine devotion towards the Guru. Blind faith can lead to disastrous consequences, but when placed upon a true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare.\n\n**Definition of Faith**\n\nJagadguru Shankaracharya has defined faith as follows:\n\n> \"Faith means firm confidence in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\" \n>\n> When such faith is placed upon a wrong personality, it can lead to disastrous consequences. But when it is placed on the true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare.\n\n**Guidelines for Placing Faith**\n\nBefore placing faith on any Guru, we must use our intellect to confirm that the Guru has realized the Absolute Truth, and he is teaching it in accordance with the eternal Vedic scriptures. Once this is confirmed, then we should strive to deepen our faith in such a Guru, and surrender to God under his guidance.\n\n**The Importance of True Devotion**\n\nThe Shvetashvatar Upaniṣhad states:\n\n> \"The imports of all the Vedic knowledge is revealed within the hearts of those who engage with unflinching faith in devotion toward Guru and God.\"\n>\n> This verse emphasizes the importance of true devotion and faith in understanding the Vedic knowledge."

    "explanation": "**Classification of Sādhaks**\n\nThe Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu classifies sādhaks into three classes based on the degree of faith and knowledge.\n\n### Three Classes of Sādhaks\n\n#### Highest Class\nThe highest sādhak is one who possesses knowledge of the scriptures and is also endowed with firm faith. This is evident in the verse:\n```v39\nśhāstre yuktau cha nipuṇaḥ sarvathā dṛiḍha-niśhchayaḥ\nprauḍha-śhraddho ‘dhikārī yaḥ sa bhaktāvuttamo mataḥ\nyaḥ śhāstrādiṣhvanipuṇaḥ śhraddhāvān sa tu madhyamaḥ\nyo bhavet komala śhraddhaḥ sa kaniṣhṭho nigadyate\n(1.2.17-19)\n```\nHe is the one who possesses both scriptural knowledge and firm faith, which makes him the most superior of all sādhaks.\n\n#### Medium Class\nThe medium class sādhak is one who does not have knowledge of the scriptures, but is endowed with faith toward God and Guru. This means that he trusts in the divine plan and the guidance of his spiritual master.\n\n#### Lowest Class\nThe lowest class sādhak is one who neither has scriptural knowledge nor is endowed with faith. This person lacks both the intellectual and spiritual faculties required to attain peace.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes that the doubting person, who lacks faith and scriptural knowledge, cannot attain peace either in this life or hereafter. His example illustrates how faith is essential in everyday activities, such as ordering food at a restaurant or getting a shave from a barber. Without faith, one becomes indecisive and unable to enjoy the benefits of life or spiritual growth.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   The Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu classifies sādhaks into three classes.\n*   The highest class sādhak possesses both scriptural knowledge and firm faith.\n*   The medium class sādhak trusts in God, Guru, and scriptural guidance.\n*   The lowest class sādhak lacks both scriptural knowledge and faith.\n*   Faith is essential in everyday activities, such as ordering food or getting a shave."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Karmas**\n\n### Definition of Karmas\nKarmas refer to the actions involved in prescribed rituals and social duties.\n\n### Explanation of Terms\n\n#### Sanyās\n\"Sanyās\" is derived from the Sanskrit word for \"to renounce.\" It refers to the act of renouncing worldly attachments and dedicating one's life to spiritual pursuits.\n\n#### Yog\n\"Yog\" means \"to unite with God.\" In this context, Shree Krishna uses the term \"yogasanyasta karmāṇaṁ,\" which translates to \"those who renounce all ritualistic actions, dedicating their body, mind, and soul to God.\"\n\n### The Concept of Karmas in Action\n\nShree Krishna explains that true spiritualists perform their actions as a service to God, and in doing so, they are free from the binding effects of karma.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   Actions that are performed with a sense of self-interest or attachment bind one to karma.\n*   On the other hand, actions that are performed solely for the pleasure of God become free from karma.\n*   This concept can be illustrated with an example: when you multiply zero by any number, the result is always zero.\n\n### The Science of Unbinding Karmas\n\nShree Krishna compares the enlightened souls who perform their actions with devotion to God as \"multiplying numbers with zero.\" Just as multiplying zero by any number results in zero, the actions of these enlightened souls do not bind them to karma.\n\n**The Result of Unbinding Karmas**\n\nWhen we perform our actions with devotion and offer them to God in the fire of Yog, they become free from all karmic reactions. This means that even though we may be doing various types of work, the Saints remain unfettered from the bonds of karma.\n\n**The Significance of Unbinding Karmas**\n\nThis concept highlights the importance of cultivating devotion and serving God in our daily lives. By performing our actions with a sense of selflessness and devotion, we can transcend the limitations of karma and achieve spiritual liberation."

    "explanation": "**The Heart as a Metaphor for the Mind**\n=====================================================\n\n4.42 The use of the word \"heart\" does not imply the physical machine housed in the chest that pumps blood in the body. The Vedas state that one’s physical brain resides in the head, but the subtle mind resides in the region of the heart. That is the reason why in love and hatred one experiences pain in the heart. In this sense, the heart is the source of compassion, love, sympathy, and all the good emotions. So when Shree Krishna mentions doubts that have arisen in the heart, he means doubts that have arisen in the mind, which is the subtle machine that resides in the region of the heart.\n\n**The Role of a Spiritual Master**\n=====================================\n\nIn the role of being the Spiritual Master of Arjun, the Lord has imparted to his disciple the knowledge of how to gain insightful wisdom from the practice of karm yog. He now advises Arjun to utilize both wisdom and faith to cleave out the doubts from his mind.\n\n**Dual Instructions for Arjun**\n=====================================\n\nHe then gives the call of action and asks Arjun to rise up and do his duty in the spirit of karm yog. The dual instructions to both refrain from action and to engage in action still create confusion in Arjun’s mind, which he reveals in the opening of the next chapter.\n\n**Key Points**\n---------------\n\n*   The \"heart\" refers to the subtle mind, not the physical heart.\n*   The Vedas state that the physical brain resides in the head and the subtle mind resides in the region of the heart.\n*   The heart is a source of compassion, love, sympathy, and good emotions.\n*   Shree Krishna's mention of doubts in the heart refers to doubts in the mind.\n\n**Implications for Arjun**\n-------------------------\n\n*   The dual instructions create confusion in Arjun's mind.\n*   He must utilize wisdom and faith to cleave out doubts from his mind.\n\n**Implications for the Reader**\n--------------------------------\n\n*   The concept of the heart as a metaphor for the mind is essential to understanding the teachings of karm yog.\n*   The dual nature of action and inaction is a fundamental principle of karm yog."

    "explanation": "**5.1: Arjun's Dilemma**\n====================================\n\nThis is the fifth of Arjun’s sixteen questions. Shree Krishna praised both the renunciation of works and work with devotion.\n\n### Context Review\n-------------------\n\n**Chapter 1: Grief and Setting**\nThe first chapter described the nature of Arjun’s grief and created the setting for Shree Krishna to begin to relate spiritual knowledge to him.\n\n**Chapter 2: The Science of the Self**\nIn the second chapter, Shree Krishna revealed to Arjun the science of the self and explained that since the soul is immortal, nobody would die in the war, and hence it was foolish to lament.\n\nHe then reminded Arjun that his karm (social duty) as a warrior was to fight the war on the side of righteousness.\n\nBut, since karm binds one to the fruits of actions, Shree Krishna encouraged Arjun to dedicate the fruits of his works to God.\n\nHis actions would then become karm-yog, or “united with God through works.”\n\n### Chapter 3: Duties and Purity of Mind\nIn the third chapter, the Supreme Lord explained that performing one’s duties is necessary because it helps to purify the mind.\n\nBut He also said that a person who has already developed purity of mind is not obliged to perform any social duty (verse 3.17).\n\n### Chapter 4: Types of Sacrifices\nIn the fourth chapter, the Lord explained the various kinds of sacrifices (works that can be done for the pleasure of God).\n\nHe concluded by saying that sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than mechanical ritualistic sacrifice.\n\nHe also said that all sacrifice ends in the knowledge of one’s relationship with God.\n\nFinally, in verse 4.41, He introduced the principle of karm sanyās, in which ritualistic duties and social obligations are renounced and one engages in devotional service with the body, mind, and soul.\n\n### Arjun's Doubt\n----------------\n\nThese instructions perplexed Arjun. He thought that karm sanyās (renunciation of works) and karm-yog (work in devotion) have opposite natures, and it is not possible to perform both simultaneously.\n\nHence, he raises his doubt before Shree Krishna."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Shree Krishna's Comparison of Karma Sanyas and Karma-Yog**\n\n### In this verse, Shree Krishna compares karma sanyas and karma-yog\n\nIt is a very deep verse; so let’s understand it one word at a time.\n\n#### A Karma Yogi\n\nA karma yogi is one who does both, spiritual and social, duties. Social duties are done with the body while the mind is attached to God.\n\n**Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj's Perspective**\n\n\"Sochu mana yaha karm mama saba lakhata hari guru pyāre\" (Sādhan Bhakti Tattva)\n\n“Dear one! Think always that all your actions are being observed by God and Guru.” This is the sādhanā of karma-yog, by which we gradually elevate ourselves from bodily consciousness to spiritual consciousness.\n\n#### Karma Sanyas\n\nKarma sanyas is for elevated souls, who have already risen beyond the bodily platform. A karma sanyasi is one who discards social duties due to complete absorption in God, and engages entirely in the performance of spiritual duties (devotional service to God).\n\n**Lakshman's Sentiment**\n\nThe sentiment of karma sanyas was nicely expressed by Lakshman, when Lord Ram asked him to fulfill his worldly duties:\n\n\"More sabai eka tumha swāmī, dīnabandhu ura antarayāmī\" (Ramayan)\n\nLakshman said to Ram, \"You are my Master, Father, Mother, Friend, and everything. I will only fulfill my duty toward You with all my might. So please do not tell me about any of my bodily duties.\"\n\n#### Characteristics of Karma Sanyas\n\nThose who practice karma sanyas do not consider themselves to be the body, and as a result, they do not feel obligated to discharge their bodily duties. Such karma sanyasies dedicate their full time and energy to spirituality, while karma yogis have to split their time between worldly and spiritual duties.\n\nThe karma sanyasies can thus move much faster toward God, while the karma yogis are encumbered with social duties.\n\n#### Comparison of Karma Sanyas and Karma-Yog\n\nHowever, in this verse, Shree Krishna extols karma-yog beyond karma sanyas and recommends it to Arjun as the preferred path. This is because karma sanyasies are exposed to a danger. If, having renounced their duties they cannot absorb their mind in God, they are left neither here nor there.\n\nIn India, there are tens of thousands of such sadhus, who felt they were detached, and thus, renounced the world, but their mind was not yet attached to God. Consequently, they could not experience the divine bliss of the spiritual path.\n\nAnd so, although wearing the saffron clothes of mendicants, they indulge in grossly sinful activities such as smoking opium. Only the ignorant mistake their sloth as detachment from the world.\n\nOn the other hand, karma yogis do both their worldly duties and spiritual practice. So if their mind turns away from spirituality, at least they have their work to fall back upon.\n\nKarma-yog is thus the safer path for majority of the people, while karma sanyas is only to be pursued under the expert guidance of a Guru."

    "explanation": "**Detachment and Equanimity**\n=====================================\n\n### The Concept of Detachment\n\nKarm yogis continue to discharge their worldly duties while internally practicing detachment. Hence, they accept both positive and negative outcomes with equanimity, as the grace of God. The Lord has designed this world so beautifully that it makes us experience both happiness and distress for our gradual elevation.\n\n### The Importance of Tolerance\n\nIf we continue to lead our regular lives and tolerate whatever comes our way, while happily doing our duty, the world naturally pushes us toward gradual spiritual elevation.\n\n### A Story to Illustrate Detachment\n\nThere is a sweet story that illustrates this concept. A piece of wood went to a sculptor and said, \"Can you please make me beautiful?\" The sculptor replied, \"I am ready to do that. But are you ready for it?\"\n\n### The Wood's Response\n\nThe wood replied, \"Yes, I am also ready.\" The sculptor took out his tools and began hammering and chiseling. The wood screamed, \"What are you doing? Please stop! This is so painful.\" The sculptor replied wisely, \"If you wish to become beautiful, you will have to bear the pain.\"\n\n### The Wood's Transformation\n\nThe wood kept screaming, \"Enough for today; I can't bear it any further. Please do it tomorrow.\" The sculptor was undeterred in his task, and in a few days, the wood was transformed into a beautiful deity, fit to sit on the altar of the temple.\n\n### Applying Detachment in Our Lives\n\nIn the same way, our hearts are rough and unfinished because of endless lifetimes of attachment in the world. If we wish to become internally beautiful, we must be willing to tolerate pain and let the world do its job of purifying us.\n\n### Key Points for Karm Yogis\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Work with devotion\n*   Are equipoised in the results\n*   Practice attaching their mind to God"

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Concept of Renunciation**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Two Kinds of Renunciation\n\nIn the context of the Bhagavad Gita, renunciation is a crucial aspect of spiritual growth. Shree Krishna uses the word `sānkhya` to refer to `karm sanyās`, or the renunciation of actions with the cultivation of knowledge. Here, it's essential to understand that renunciation is of two kinds: `phalgu vairāgya` and `yukt vairāgya`.\n\n#### Phalgu Vairāgya: An Escapist Attitude\n\n`Phalgu vairāgya` is where people look upon the world as cumbersome, and renounce it with the desire of getting rid of responsibilities and hardships. Such `phalgu vairāgya` is an escapist attitude and is unstable.\n\n*   **Characteristics of Phalgu Vairāgya:**\n    *   Motivated by the desire to run away from difficulties\n    *   Detached from spiritual path when encountering difficulties\n    *   Desire to run back to worldly life\n\n#### Yukt Vairāgya: A Stable and Undeterred Attitude\n\n`Yukt vairāgya` is where people see the whole world as the energy of God. They do not see what they possess as belonging to them, and do not wish to enjoy it for themselves. `Yukt vairāgya` is stable and undeterred by difficulties.\n\n*   **Characteristics of Yukt Vairāgya:**\n    *   Motivated by the desire to serve God with whatever He has given\n    *   Stable and undeterred by difficulties\n\n### The Karm Yogis: A Practical Application of Renunciation\n\nThe `karm yogis`, while conducting their daily duties externally, develop the sentiment of `yukt vairāgya`, or stable renunciation. They see themselves as the servants and God as the enjoyer, and hence they become fixed in the consciousness of doing everything for His pleasure.\n\n*   **Similarities between Karm Yogis and Karma Sanyas:**\n    *   Internally, they are no less than `sanyāsīs`\n    *   Externally, they may appear to be worldly people\n\n### Examples of Great Kings in Indian History\n\nThe Puranas and Itihās relate the examples of great kings in Indian history, who, though externally discharging their kingly duties with diligence and living in royal opulence, were mentally completely absorbed in God-consciousness.\n\n*   **Examples of Exemplary Karm Yogis:**\n    +   Prahlad\n    +   Dhruv\n    +   Ambarish\n    +   Prithu\n    +   Vibheeshan\n    +   Yudhishthir\n\n### The Bhagavatam's Teaching on Renunciation\n\nThe Shreemad Bhagavatam states:\n\n`gṛihītvāpīndriyair arthān yo na dveṣhṭi na hṛṣiḥyati\nviṣhṇor māyām idaṁ paśhyan sa vai bhāgavatottamaḥ   \n(11.2.48)`\n\n\"One who accepts the objects of the senses, neither yearning for them nor running away from them, in the divine consciousness that everything is the energy of God and is to be used in His service, such a person is the highest devotee.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nBy understanding the two kinds of renunciation and how they relate to `karm yog` and `karm sanyās`, we can see why the truly learned consider them to be similar aspects of spiritual growth. By following one of these paths, the results of both are achieved."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Mind Intention in Spiritual Practice**\n=================================================================\n\nIn spiritual practice, the intention of the mind is what matters, not the external activities. One may be living in the holy land of Vrindavan, but if the mind contemplates on eating rasgullās in Kolkata, one will be deemed to be living in Kolkata. Conversely, if a person lives amidst the hubbub of Kolkata and keeps the mind absorbed in the divine land of Vrindavan, he will get the benefit of residing there.\n\n**Determining Level of Consciousness**\n-----------------------------------\n\nAll the Vedic scriptures state that our level of consciousness is determined by the state of our mind:\n\n```vscript\nmana eva manuṣhyāṇāṁ kāraṇaṁ bandha mokṣhayoḥ\n\n(Pañchadaśhī)\n```\n\nThis verse states that the mind is the cause of bondage and liberation. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj also emphasizes the same principle:\n\n```verse\nbandhan aur mokṣha kā, kāraṇ manahi bakhān\n\nyāte kauniu bhakti karu, karu mana te haridhyān\n\n(Bhakti Śhatak verse 19)\n```\n\nAccording to this verse, bondage and liberation depend upon the state of the mind. Whatever form of devotion you choose to do, keep the mind engaged in meditation upon God.\n\n**Observations and Misunderstandings**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThose who do not possess this spiritual vision see the external distinction between a karm sanyāsī and a karm yogi, and declare the karm sanyāsī to be superior because of the external renunciation. However, those who are learned see that both the karm sanyāsī and the karm yogi have absorbed their minds in God, and so they are both identical in their internal consciousness.\n\n**Contrasting Perspectives**\n---------------------------\n\n*   Those who do not possess spiritual vision see only external differences and declare the karm sanyāsī superior.\n*   Those who are learned see that both karm sanyāsī and karm yogi have absorbed their minds in God, making them identical in internal consciousness.\n*   Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj emphasizes the same principle: bondage and liberation depend upon the state of the mind.\n\nIn summary, it's essential to focus on the intention of the mind rather than external activities in spiritual practice. Our level of consciousness is determined by our state of mind, and devotion should be accompanied by a clear understanding of this principle."

    "explanation": "**The Test of Renunciation**\n=====================================\n\n### A Yogi's Dilemma\n\nLiving in a cave in the Himalayas, a yogi may feel that he has renounced worldly life, but the test of that renunciation comes when he returns to the city. For instance, one sadhu practiced austerities for twelve years in the mountains of Garhwal. He came down to Haridwar to participate in the holy fair called Kumbh Melā.\n\n### A Moment of Anger\n\nIn the hustle and bustle of the fair, someone accidentally placed his shoe on the sadhu’s bare foot. The sadhu was infuriated, and screamed, “Are you blind? Can you not see where you are going?” Later he repented for permitting anger to overcome him, and lamented, “Twelve years of austerities in the mountains got washed away by living one day in the city!”\n\n### The World as an Arena\n---------------------------\n\nThe world is the arena where our renunciation gets tested. Shree Krishna says that while performing one’s duties in the world, a person should slowly learn to rise above anger, greed, and desire. Instead, if one first gives up duties, it is very difficult to purify the mind; and without a pure mind, true detachment remains a distant dream.\n\n### The Importance of Duties\n-----------------------------\n\nWe are all propelled to work by our nature. Arjun was a warrior, and if he had artificially renounced his duty, to retire to the forest, his nature would make him work there as well. He would probably gather a few tribesmen and declare himself their king.\n\n### Using Natural Inclinations\n-----------------------------\n\nInstead, it would be more fruitful to use his natural inclinations and talents in the service of God. So the Lord instructs him, “Continue to fight, but make one change. At first, you came to this battleground on the presumption of saving a kingdom. Now, instead, simply dedicate your service unselfishly to God. In this way, you will naturally purify the mind and achieve true renunciation from within.”\n\n### The Maturity of Wisdom\n---------------------------\n\nA tender and unripe fruit clings fast to the tree that bears and nourishes it. But the same fruit, when fully ripe, severs its connection from its sustainer. Similarly from the material existence, the karm yogi gets the experience that matures into wisdom.\n\n### The Value of Hard Work\n---------------------------\n\nJust as sound sleep is only possible for those who have worked hard, deep meditation comes to those who have purified their minds through karm-yog."

This understanding is crucial for rising above material consciousness.\n\n**The Stumbling Block: Pride**\n---------------------------\n\nWhen we accomplish something substantial, we often feel a sense of pride in our abilities. This pride can be a stumbling block to spiritual growth, as it creates an attachment to our ego and bodies. However, for karm yogis, this obstacle can be overcome with ease.\n\n**The God-Conscious Karm Yogis**\n-----------------------------\n\nThese individuals possess a purified intellect, which allows them to see themselves as separate from their bodies. They do not attribute their bodily actions to themselves, but rather recognize that the body is made from the material energy of God. As a result, they attribute all their works to the power of God.\n\n**The Power of Surrender**\n-------------------------\n\nKarm yogis have surrendered to the will of God, depending on Him to inspire their minds and intellects in accordance with His divine will. This surrender allows them to remain situated in the understanding that God is the doer of everything.\n\n**A Message from Sage Vasishth**\n--------------------------------\n\nSage Vasishth advised Lord Rama to engage in actions diligently externally, but to practice seeing oneself as the non-doer and God as the prime mover of all activities.\n\n**Cartā Bahirkartāntarloke Vihara Rāghava**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n(Yog Vāsiṣhṭh)\n\n“O Rama, externally engage in actions diligently, but internally practice to see yourself as the non-doer and God as the prime mover of all your activities.” In this divine consciousness, karm yogis see themselves as mere instruments in the hands of God.\n\n**The Consequences of Work Done in this Consciousness**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna explains that when individuals work in this consciousness, they will experience the consequences of their actions in a different way. This understanding has not been explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that the karm yogis will experience a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and their place in it.\n\n**The Nature of Reality**\n---------------------------\n\nIn this consciousness, individuals see themselves as mere instruments in the hands of God. They understand that all actions are done by the power of God, and that they depend on Him to inspire their minds and intellects in accordance with His divine will.\n\n**The Importance of Surrender**\n-----------------------------\n\nKarm yoga is not about individual effort, but about surrendering to the will of God. By depending on God and recognizing His power, individuals can rise above material consciousness and experience a deeper understanding of reality.\n\n**The Benefits of this Understanding**\n---------------------------------------\n\nBy embracing the concept of karm yoga, individuals can experience a range of benefits, including:\n\n*   A deeper understanding of the nature of reality\n*   An increased sense of humility and detachment from ego and body\n*   A greater recognition of the power of God in their lives\n*   A more profound sense of connection with God and the universe"

So, they remain situated in the understanding that God is the doer of everything.\n\n**Advice from Sage Vasishth**\n\n Kartā bahirkartāntarloke vihara rāghava \n(Yog Vāsiṣhṭh)\n\n\"O Ram, externally engage in actions diligently, but internally practice to see yourself as the non-doer and God as the prime mover of all your activities.\" \n\n**The Non-Dual Awareness**\n\nIn this divine consciousness, the karm yogis see themselves as mere instruments in the hands of God. This understanding allows them to transcend ego and material consciousness, rising above the limitations of the individual self.\n\n**Consequences of Work in Non-Dual Awareness**\n\nShree Krishna explains in the following verse the consequences of work done in this consciousness."

    "explanation": "**The Lotus Flower: A Symbol of Purity and Spiritual Growth**\n\n### Overview of the Lotus Flower\n\n5.10 Both Hindu and Buddhist scriptures abound with analogies of the lotus flower. The word is used as a respectful appellation while describing various parts of God's divine body.\n\n#### Names and Meanings of the Lotus Flower\n\n* **Charaṇ-kamal**: \"Lotus-like feet\"\n* **Kamalekṣhaṇa**: \"Lotus-like eyes\"\n* **Kar-kamal**: \"Lotus-like hands\", etc.\n\n#### Another Perspective on the Lotus Flower\n\nAnother word for the lotus flower is **Paṅkaj**, which means \"born from mud\". The lotus flower grows from the mud found at the bottom of the lake, yet it rises above the water and blossoms toward the sun.\n\n#### The Lotus Flower as a Symbol of Spiritual Growth\n\nThus, the lotus flower is often used in Sanskrit literature as an example of something that is born amidst the dirt, and rises above it while retaining its beautiful purity.\n\n### Unique Properties of the Lotus Leaf\n\nFurther, the lotus plant has large leaves that float atop the water surface of the lake. Lotus leaves are used in Indian villages for plates, as they are waterproof, and liquid poured on them does not soak through, but runs off.\n\n#### The Beauty of the Lotus Leaf\n\nThe beauty of the lotus leaf is that, although the lotus owes its birth, growth, and sustenance to the water, the leaf does not permit itself to be wetted. Water poured on the lotus leaf runs off the side, due to the small hair growing on its surface.\n\n### Applying the Analogy of the Lotus Leaf\n\nWith the help of the beautiful analogy of the lotus leaf, Shree Krishna says that just as it floats atop the surface of the lake, but does not allow itself to be wetted by the water, similarly, the **karm yogis** remain untouched by sin, although performing all kinds of works, because they perform their works in divine consciousness."

    "explanation": "**The True Dedication of Works to God**\n=====================================================\n\n### A Twist in the Tradition of Samarpana\n\nIn verse 5.11, Shree Krishna brings a new perspective to the traditional concept of Samarpana (dedication of works to God). According to this verse, enlightened yogis perform their actions for the purpose of purification. But how do they dedicate their works to God in this context?\n\n### The Supreme Enjoyer of All Activities\n\nThe yogis understand that pursuing material desires in the pursuit of happiness is futile. Realizing this, they renounce selfish desires and perform all their actions for the pleasure of God, who alone is the bhoktāraṁ yajña tapasām (Supreme enjoyer of all activities).\n\nHowever, this brings a new question: how do the yogis dedicate their works to God if they are not seeking any material gains? The answer lies in the fact that God needs nothing from us. He is the Supreme Lord of everything that exists and is perfect and complete in Himself.\n\n### The Customary Offering\n\nTo acknowledge this, it becomes customary while making an offering to God to say:\n\ntvadiyaṁ vastu govinda tubhyameva samarpitaṁ\n\n\"O God, I am offering Your item back to You.\"\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Saint Yamunacharya:\n\nmama nātha yad asti yo ’smyahaṁ sakalam taddhī tavaiva mādhava\n\nniyata-svam iti prabuddha-dhāir atha vā kiṁ nu samarpayāmi te\n\n(Śhrī Stotra Ratna, 50)\n\n\"O Lord Vishnu, husband of the Goddess of Fortune, when I was in ignorance, I thought I would give You many things. But now when I have gained knowledge, I realize that everything I own is already Yours. What then can I offer to You?\"\n\n### The Purity of the Heart\n\nBut there is one activity that is in our hands and not in God's hands; that is the purification of our own heart (mind and intellect). When we purify our heart and engage it in devotion to God, it pleases Him more than anything else.\n\nRealizing this, the great yogis make purification of their heart as the foremost goal, not out of selfishness, but for the pleasure of God.\n\n### The Ultimate Goal\n\nThus, the yogis understand that the biggest thing they can give to God is the purity of their own hearts and they work to achieve it.\n\n### An Illustration from the Ramayan\n\nIn the Ramayan, there is a sweet illustration of this principle. Lord Ram found Sugreev to be somewhat frightened before the battle of Lanka and consoled him in the following manner:\n\npiśhāchān dānavān yakṣhān pṛithivyāṁ chaiva rākṣhasān\n\naṅgugreṇa tānhanyā michchhan harī gaṇeśhvaraḥ\n\n(Vālmīki Ramayan)\n\nLord Ram said, \"If I, the Supreme Lord, merely bend the little finger of My left hand, what to speak of Ravan and Kumbhakarn, all the demons in the world will die.\"\n\nSugreev responded, \"If that is the case, my Lord, then in order to kill Ravan, what is the need for collecting this army?\"\n\nThe Lord replied, \"That is merely to give you all the opportunity to engage in devotional service for your own purification. However, do not assume that I need your help in annihilating these demons.\"\n\n### Our Permanent Asset\n\nOur only permanent asset is the purity that we achieve. It goes with us into the next life, while all material assets get left behind.\n\n### The Determining Factor of Our Life\n\nHence in the final analysis, the success and failure of our life is determined by the extent to which we manage to achieve purity of heart.\n\n### Welcoming Adversity\n\nElevated yogis welcome adverse circumstances because they see them as opportunities for purifying the heart.\n\n### The Wisdom of Saint Kabir\n\nSaint Kabir states:\n\nnindak niyare rākhiye āngan kuṭi chhabāya\n\nnita sābun pānī binā nirmala kare subhāya\n\n\"If you are desirous of quickly cleansing your heart, cultivate the company of a critic. When you tolerate his acrimonious words, your heart will be cleansed without water and soap.\"\n\n### The Purity of the Heart is the Ultimate Goal\n\nThus, when purification of the heart is made the prime motive of actions, adversarial circumstances are then welcomed as God-sent opportunities for further progress, and one remains in equanimity in both success and failure.\n\n### The Heart Gets Purified\n\nAs we work for the pleasure of God, the heart gets purified; and as the heart gets purified, we naturally offer the results of all our actions to the Supreme Lord.\n\n### The Success and Failure of Our Life\n\nOur success and failure are determined by the extent to which we manage to achieve purity of heart.\n\n### The Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the yogis understand that the biggest thing they can give to God is the purity of their own hearts and they work to achieve it. By making purification of the heart as the foremost goal, we welcome adverse circumstances as opportunities for further progress. And in this state of equanimity, we offer the results of all our actions to the Supreme Lord."

Shree Krishna gives the answer in this verse. Those who are unattached and unmotivated by material rewards are never bound by karma.\n\n*   But those craving reward and obsessed with the desire to enjoy material pleasures become entangled in the reactions of work.\n\n**The Concept of Yukt and Ayukt**\n==================================\n\n*   The word **yukt** means “united in consciousness with God.” It can also mean “not wanting any reward other than purification of the heart.”\n*   Persons who are **yukt** relinquish desire for the rewards of their actions, and instead engage in works for the purpose of self-purification.\n*   Therefore, they soon attain divine consciousness and eternal beatitude.\n\n**The Consequence of Desiring Material Rewards**\n==================================================\n\nOn the other hand, **ayukt** means “not united with God in consciousness.” It can also denote “desiring mundane rewards not beneficial to the soul.”\n\n*   Such persons, incited by cravings, lustfully desire the rewards of actions.\n*   The reactions of work performed in this consciousness bind these **ayukt** persons to the **samsara** or the cycle of life and death.\n\n**Consequences of Attachment**\n=============================\n\n*   Those who are attached to material rewards and desires will be bound by karma.\n*   They will experience a cycle of life and death, perpetually trapped in the material world."

The soul is like the king of the city, whose administration is carried out by the ministry of the ego, intellect, mind, senses, and life-energy.\n\n#### The Reign Over the Body\n\nThe reign over the body continues until time, in the form of death, snatches away the corporeal frame. However, even while the reign continues, enlightened yogis do not see themselves as the body nor do they consider themselves as the lord of the body.\n\n#### A Detached Observer\n\nRather, they hold the body and all activities performed by it as belonging to God. Renouncing all actions through the mind, such enlightened souls remain happily situated in their body.\n\nThis is also called **sākṣhī bhāv**, or the attitude of being the detached observer of all that is happening around.\n\n### The Analogy from Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad\n\nThe analogy in this verse is also given in the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad:\n\nnavadwāre pure dehī hanso lelāyate bahiḥ\nvaśhī sarvasya lokasya sthāvarasya charasya cha\n\n(3.18)\n\n**The Body as a City**\n\n\"The body consists of nine gates—two ears, one mouth, two nostrils, two eyes, anus, and genitals.

When the soul establishes its connection with the Lord, it becomes free like Him, even while residing in the body.\"\n\n### Implications of the Verse\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna declared that the embodied soul is neither the doer nor the cause of anything.

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Free Will**\n\n5.15 God is not responsible either for anyone's virtuous deeds or sinful actions. God's work in this regard is threefold:\n\n*   1) He provides the soul with the power to act.\n*   2) Once we have performed actions with the power supplied to us, He notes our actions.\n*   3) He gives us the results of our karmas.\n\n**The Individual Soul's Freedom**\n\nThe individual soul has the freedom to perform good or bad actions by the exercise of its own free will. That free will is the basis of the play of creation and it accounts for the varieties of consciousness amongst the souls in existence.\n\n**The Role of God**\n\nGod's work is like that of an umpire in a cricket match. He keeps giving the results, \"Four runs!\" \"Six runs!\" \"He's out!\" The umpire cannot be blamed for the decision, for it was based upon the way the player performed.\n\n**Why Free Will?**\n\nOne may ask why God granted free will to the soul. It is because the soul is a tiny part of God and it possesses His qualities to a minuscule extent. God is abhijña swarāṭ (supremely independent), and so the soul also possesses a tiny amount of independence to utilize its senses, mind, and intellect in the manner it wishes.\n\n**The Importance of Free Will**\n\nAlso, without free will there can be no love. A machine cannot love since it has no independence to choose. Only a personality that has the ability to choose possesses the option to love. Since God has created us to love Him, He has endowed us with free will.\n\n**The Exercise of Free Will**\n\nThe exercise of our own free will results in good and bad deeds, and we must not blame God for them.\n\n**Ignorance of Free Will**\n\nIn ignorance, some souls do not even realize that they possess the freedom to choose their actions and hold God responsible for their mistakes. Others realize they possess a free will, but they harbor the pride of doership in the egoistic notion of being the body. This is again a sign of ignorance.\n\n**Dispelling Ignorance**\n\nShree Krishna explains next how such ignorance can be dispelled."

The Ramayan states:\n\n`rākāpati ṣhoṛasa uahiñ  tārāgana samudāi\nsakala girinha dava lāia binu rabi rāti na jāi`\n\n\"Despite the combined light of the full moon and all the visible stars in a cloudless sky, the night does not go. But the moment the sun rises, the night makes a hasty exit.\" The light of the sun is such that the darkness cannot remain before it. The light of God's knowledge has a similar effect in dispelling the darkness of ignorance.\n\n### Dispelling Darkness\n\nDarkness is responsible for creating illusions. In the darkness of the cinema hall, the light falling on the screen creates the illusion of reality, and people get absorbed in watching it. However, when the main lights in the cinema hall are switched on, the illusion is dispelled and people wake up from their reverie to realize that they were only watching a movie. Similarly, in the darkness of ignorance, we identify ourselves with the body, and consider ourselves to be the doers and enjoyers of our actions.\n\n### The Power of Spiritual Light\n\nWhen the light of God's knowledge begins shining brightly, the illusion beats a hasty retreat, and the soul wakes up to its true spiritual identity, even while it lives in the city of nine gates. The soul had fallen into illusion because God's material energy (avidyā śhakti) had covered it in darkness. The illusion is dispelled when God's spiritual energy (vidyā śhakti) illumines it with the light of knowledge.\n\n**Key Points**\n--------------\n\n*   The sun's power is incomparable in removing darkness.\n*   Darkness creates illusions, and light dispels them.\n*   The light of God's knowledge has a similar effect in dispelling the darkness of ignorance.\n*   When spiritual light shines, illusions retreat, and the soul wakes up to its true identity.\n*   God's material energy (avidyā śhakti) covers the soul in darkness, while spiritual energy (vidyā śhakti) illuminates it with the light of knowledge."

It is often translated as \"with the eyes of knowledge.\" This concept emphasizes that true understanding and wisdom come from a deep understanding of the world and our place in it.\n\n### The Significance of Humility\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes that the sign of divine knowledge is accompanied by a sense of humility. This means that when we possess true knowledge, we are reminded of our limitations and the interconnectedness of all living beings. On the other hand, shallow bookish knowledge is often accompanied by pride and a sense of superiority.\n\n### Seeing with Divine Knowledge\n\nShree Krishna reveals in this verse that divine knowledge bestows a vision so different from physical sight. When we possess true knowledge, we see the world in a new light. We understand that all living beings are souls who are fragments of God, and therefore divine in nature.\n\n### Examples from the Text\n\nShree Krishna provides several examples to illustrate this point. On one hand, a Vedic Brahmin who conducts worship ceremonies is respected. A cow is milked for human consumption, while a dog-eater is usually looked down upon as an outcaste. An elephant is used for ceremonial parades, while neither the cow nor the dog are.\n\nOn the other hand, these species are sharp contrasts in the physical spectrum of life on our planet. However, a truly learned person endowed with spiritual knowledge sees them all as eternal souls and views them with an equal eye.\n\n### The Perspective of Knowledge\n\nThe Vedas do not support the view that the Brahmins are of higher caste, while the Shudras are of lower caste. From the perspective of knowledge, all social classes are eternal souls who are tiny parts of God and therefore alike.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   **Prajñā chakṣhu** refers to the perception of things through the perspective of knowledge.\n*   **Humility is an essential component** of divine knowledge, serving as a reminder of our limitations and the interconnectedness of all living beings.\n*   **True knowledge** bestows a vision so different from physical sight, understanding that all living beings are souls who are fragments of God.\n*   **The Vedas** do not support social hierarchies, rather, they emphasize the equality and divinity of all beings."

Further, equality in vision also means to rise beyond likes and dislikes, happiness and misery, pleasure and pain.\n\n### Transcending the Cycles of Birth and Death\n\nShree Krishna says that those who are able to do so transcend the `samsara` of repeated birth and death. To achieve this equality of vision, one must rise above the limitations of the physical body.\n\n### The Limitations of Bodily Consciousness\n\nSo long as we think of ourselves as the body, we cannot attain this equality of vision because we will experience continued desires and aversions for bodily pleasures and discomforts.\n\n### Raising the Mind to a Higher Plane\n\nSaints rise above bodily consciousness and absorb their minds in God, giving up all worldly attachments. This is illustrated by the Ramayan:\n\n> **\"Lakshman served Lord Ram and Sita, just as an ignorant person serves his body.\"**\n\n### The Power of Divine Consciousness\n\nWhen one's mind is situated in this divine consciousness, attachment to bodily pleasures and pains get transcended, and one reaches a state of equanimity.\n\n### The Path to Equanimity\n\nThis equipoise that comes through the sacrifice of selfish bodily desires makes one godlike in demeanor. As stated by the Mahabharat:\n\n> **\"One who gives up desires becomes like God.\"**\n\n### The Key to Spiritual Growth\n\nTo achieve spiritual growth and transcend the cycles of birth and death, one must cultivate an equal vision toward all living beings.

Rigorous training is undertaken to reach this state of clarity and precision, ultimately leading to equanimity, and destruction of self-will. However, the same state is naturally reached in devotion to God, when we surrender our will to the divine.\n\n### Devotion and Equanimity\n\nIn accordance with verse 5.17, when we unite our will to the will of God, then both pleasure and pain are serenely accepted as His grace.\n\n### A Beautiful Story\n\nA beautiful story illustrates this attitude. A wild horse once ran into a farm. People congratulated the farmer on his good luck. He said, “Good luck, bad luck, who knows? It is all the will of God.”\n\nA few days later, the horse ran away, back into the forest. His neighbors commiserated with his bad luck. He said, “Bad luck, good luck, who knows? It is all God’s will.”\n\nA few more days went by, and the horse returned with twenty more wild horses. Again people congratulated the farmer on his stroke of good luck. He wisely reflected, “What is good and bad luck? This is all God’s will.”\n\nA few days later, the farmer’s son broke his leg while riding one of the horses. The neighbors came to express grief. The wise farmer responded, “Pleasant and unpleasant, it is only God’s will.”\n\n### Key Insights\n\nSome key insights from this story are:\n\n*   **Acceptance is the key**: The farmer's acceptance of both good and bad luck, as the will of God, helps him to develop equanimity.\n*   **Surrender is essential**: When we surrender our will to the divine, we can accept both pleasure and pain as His grace.\n*   **Divine knowledge brings understanding**: The farmer's experience shows that divine knowledge brings the understanding of our self-interest lying in giving pleasure to God.\n\n### The Symptom of Transcendence\n\nDivine knowledge brings the understanding that our self-interest lies in giving pleasure to God. This leads to surrender to the will of God, and when the self-will gets merged in the divine will, one develops the equanimity to serenely accept both pleasure and pain as His grace. This is the symptom of a person situated in transcendence.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   **Acceptance is essential**: Accepting both good and bad luck, as the will of God, helps us to develop equanimity.\n*   **Surrender is key**: Surrendering our will to the divine helps us to accept both pleasure and pain as His grace.\n*   **Divine knowledge brings understanding**: Divine knowledge brings the understanding of our self-interest lying in giving pleasure to God."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Bhog (Material Enjoyment)**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Creation of Sensations and Pleasures\n\nThe senses create sensations of pleasure in contact with the sense objects. The mind, which is like the sixth sense, derives pleasure from honor, praise, circumstances, success, etc. All these pleasures of body and mind are known as **bhog** (material enjoyment). Such worldly pleasures cannot satisfy the soul for the following reasons:\n\n### Three Drawbacks of Material Pleasures\n\n#### 1. Finite Nature\nWorldly pleasures are finite, and hence the feeling of deficiency remains inherent in them. One may feel happiness on becoming a millionaire, but the same millionaire becomes discontented on seeing a billionaire, and thinks, “If only I also had one billion, then I too would be happy.”\n\n#### 2. Temporal Nature\nWorldly pleasures are temporary. Once they finish, they again leave one with the feeling of misery. For example, an alcoholic enjoys the pleasure of drinking alcohol at night, but the next morning, the hangover gives him a splitting headache.\n\n#### 3. Insentient Nature\nWorldly pleasures are insentient, and hence they continuously decrease. When people see a new Academy Award prize-winning movie, they are overjoyed, but if they have to see the movie a second time to give company to a friend, their joy dries up. And if a second friend insists that they see it a third time, they say, “Give me any punishment, but don’t ask me to see that movie again.”\n\n### The Law of Diminishing Returns\nIn Economics, this is defined as the Law of Diminishing Returns. But the bliss of God is sentient; it is **sat-chit-ānand** (eternal ever-fresh divine bliss). Hence, one can go on chanting the same divine Name of God all day long, and relish ever-new devotional satisfaction in it.\n\n### The Power of Discrimination\nNo sane person enjoying a delicious dessert would be willing to give it up and eat mud instead. Similarly, when one begins to enjoy divine bliss, the mind loses all taste for material pleasures. Those endowed with the faculty of discrimination understand the above three drawbacks of material pleasures, and restrain their senses from them.\n\n### The Emphasis of Shree Krishna\nShree Krishna emphasizes this in the next verse."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Discrimination**\n\n### Understanding the Human Body's Potential\n\nThe human body presents a golden opportunity for the soul to reach the Supreme goal of God-realization. In this body, we possess the faculty of discrimination, while animals are driven by their nature. Shree Krishna emphasizes that this power of discrimination should be exercised to restrain the impulses of desire and anger.\n\n### The Meaning of the Word Kām\n\nOne meaning of the word `kām` is lust, but in this verse `kām` is used for all kinds of desires of the body and mind for material pleasures. When the mind does not attain the object of its desire, it modifies its state to exhibit anger.\n\n**The Power of Desire and Anger**\n\nThe urges of desire and anger are very powerful, like the strong current of a river. Even animals are subject to these urges, but unlike humans they are not bestowed with the discrimination to restrain them. However, the human intellect has been bestowed with the power of discrimination.\n\n**Using Discrimination to Restrain Urges**\n\nThe word `sodhum` means “to withstand.” This verse instructs us to withstand the urges of desire and anger. Sometimes one restrains the urges of the mind out of embarrassment.\n\n### A Practical Example\n\nLet us say there is a man sitting at the airport. A beautiful lady comes and sits by his side. His mind desires the pleasure of putting his arm around her, but the intellect resists with the thought, “This is improper conduct. The lady may even slap me for it.” To avoid the shame of censure, he restrains himself.\n\n**Key Principles**\n\nThe resolute intellect should be used to check the mind. As soon as the thought of savoring a material pleasure comes to the mind, one should bring the knowledge to the intellect that these are sources of misery.\n\n**Shreemad Bhagavatam's Teachings**\n\nThe Shreemad Bhagavatam states:\n\n`nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛiloke \nkaṣhṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye\ntapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ \nśhuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tvanantam` \n\n(In the human form, one should not undertake great hardships to obtain sensual pleasures, which are available even to creatures that eat excreta. Instead, one should practice austerities to purify one’s heart, and enjoy the unlimited bliss of God.)\n\n**The Opportunity for Discrimination**\n\nThis opportunity to practice discrimination is available only while the human body exists, and one who is able to check the forces of desire and anger while living, becomes a yogi. Such a person alone tastes the divine bliss within and becomes happy.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe human body presents a unique opportunity for the soul to achieve God-realization. By exercising discrimination and restraining our urges, we can live a life of true happiness and bliss."

    "explanation": "**Ritualistic Activities and Asceticism**\n=========================================\n\n### The Importance of Asceticism in Hindu Philosophy\n\nIn the context of Hindu philosophy, asceticism plays a significant role. The ritualistic activities described in the Vedas include fire sacrifices, such as Agnihotra yajna. The rules for those who enter the renounced order of sanyās state that they should not perform the ritualistic karm kāṇḍ activities; in fact, they should not touch fire at all, not even for the purpose of cooking. And they should subsist on alms instead.\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna states in this verse that merely giving up the sacrificial fire does not make one a sanyāsī (renunciant). Who are true yogis, and who are true sanyāsīs? There is much confusion in this regard. People say, “This swamiji is phalāhārī (one who eats only fruits and nothing else), and so he must be an elevated yogi.” “This bābājī (renunciant) is dūdhāhārī (subsists on milk alone), and hence he must be an even higher yogi.” “This guruji is pavanāhārī (does not eat, lives only on the breath), and so he must definitely be God-realized.” “This sadhu is a nāgā bābā (ascetic who does not wear clothes), and thus he is perfectly renounced.” However, Shree Krishna dismisses all these concepts.\n\nHe says that such external acts of asceticism do not make anyone either a sanyāsī or a yogi. Those who can renounce the fruits of their actions, by offering them to God, are the true renunciants and yogis.\n\n### The True Meaning of Yoga\n\nYoga has become a buzz word in the western world. Numerous yoga studios have sprung up in every town of every country of the world. Statistics reveal that one out of every ten persons in America is practicing yoga. But this word \"Yoga\" does not exist in the Sanskrit scriptures.\n\nThe actual word is \"Yog,\" which means \"union.\" It refers to the union of the individual consciousness with the divine consciousness. In other words, a yogi is one whose mind is fully absorbed in God. It also follows that such a yogi's mind is naturally detached from the world.\n\nHence, the true yogi is also the true sanyāsī.\n\n### Karm Yogi: The True Renunciants\n\nPersons who perform karm yog do all activities in the spirit of humble service to God without any desire whatsoever for rewards. Even though they may be gṛihasthas (living with a family), such persons are true yogis and the real renunciants.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   True asceticism is about renouncing worldly attachments, not just giving up external activities.\n*   The true meaning of yoga is \"union\" - the union of individual consciousness with divine consciousness.\n*   A true yogi's mind is naturally detached from the world, not just through physical acts of asceticism.\n\n**Common Misconceptions:**\n\n*   Giving up external activities does not automatically make someone a sanyāsī or yogi.\n*   External acts of asceticism, such as eating only fruits or living on breath alone, do not make someone a true renunciant or yogi.\n*   True yoga and sanyās are about union, not just physical acts of asceticism."

    "explanation": "**The Truth Behind Renunciation**\n=================================\n\nRenunciation, a fundamental concept in spirituality, is often misunderstood. In this verse explanation, we will delve into the meaning of renunciation, its types, and the importance of understanding it correctly.\n\n**A Sanyasi: The Ultimate Goal**\n-------------------------------\n\nAccording to Shree Krishna, a real sanyasi (renunciant) is one who is a yogi. In other words, it's someone who has united their mind with God in loving service.\n\n**Mere Renunciation is Not Enough**\n------------------------------------\n\nHowever, mere renunciation is not the goal. It's a means to an end. Renunciation means that our running in the wrong direction has stopped. We were searching for happiness in the world, and we understood that there is no happiness in material pleasures. So, we stopped running toward the world.\n\n**The Destination of the Soul**\n-------------------------------\n\nBut the destination is not reached just by stopping. The destination of the soul is God-realization. This is achieved through the process of going toward God, taking the mind toward him.\n\n**Two Kinds of Renunciation**\n------------------------------\n\nThe purport to verse 5.4 explains that there are two kinds of renunciation:\n\n### Phalgu Vairāgya\n\nPhalgu vairagya is renunciation where worldly objects are seen as objects of Maya (the material energy) and hence renounced because they are detrimental to spiritual progress.\n\n**Characteristics of Phalgu Vairagya**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   Unstable and can easily revert to attachment for the world\n*   Recognizes worldly objects as Maya, but does not utilize them in God's service\n\n**Examples of Phalgu Vairagya**\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Renouncing the world to live in a monastery, only to find that attachment returns after a few years\n*   Renouncing worldly objects because they are troublesome and miserable, but then becoming detached from spirituality as well\n\n**Yukt Vairagya**\n-----------------\n\nOn the other hand, yukt vairagya is renunciation where everything is seen as belonging to God, and hence meant to be utilized in his service.\n\n**Characteristics of Yukt Vairagya**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*   Stable and utilized for God's service\n*   Recognizes everything as belonging to God, but does not waste or throw it away\n\n**Examples of Yukt Vairagya**\n--------------------------------\n\n*   Motivated by the desire to serve God, renouncing the world to live in a monastery\n*   Utilizing worldly objects for God's service, even if it faces difficulties\n\n**The Role of a Sanyasi**\n------------------------\n\nIn the first line of this verse, Shree Krishna states that a real sanyasi is one who is a yogi. To be a yogi, one has to unite the mind with God in loving service. This can only happen when the mind is free from all material desires.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, renunciation is a complex concept that requires understanding its types and characteristics. Phalgu vairagya is unstable and can easily revert to attachment, while yukt vairagya is stable and utilized for God's service. As Shree Krishna states, a real sanyasi is one who is a yogi, and to be a yogi, one has to unite the mind with God in loving service."

    "explanation": "**The Path of Yoga: Understanding Eligibility and Progress**\n\n### The Two Paths of Attaining Welfare\n\nIn Chapter 3, Verse 3, Shree Krishna mentions that there are two paths for attaining welfare—the path of contemplation and the path of action. Between these, he recommended to Arjun to follow the path of action. Again in Chapter 5, Verse 2, he declared it to be the better path.\n\n### Does This Mean a Lifetime of Work?\n\nDoes this mean that we must keep doing work all our life? Anticipating such a question, Shree Krishna sets the limits for it. When we perform **karm yog**, it leads to the purification of the mind and the ripening of spiritual knowledge. But once the mind has been purified and we advance in **Yog**, then we can leave **karm yog** and take to **karm sanyās**. Material activities now serve no purpose, and meditation now becomes the means.\n\n### The Path We Must Follow\n\nThe path we must follow filters down to a matter of our eligibility and Shree Krishna explains the criteria of eligibility in this verse. He says that for those who are aspiring for **Yog**, the path of **karm yog** is more suitable; and those who are elevated in **Yog**, the path of **karm sanyās** is more suitable.\n\n### Understanding Yog\n\nThe word **Yog** refers to both the goal and the process to reach the goal. When we talk of it as being the goal, we use **Yog** as meaning “union with God.” And when we talk of it as being the process, we use **Yog** as meaning the “path” to union with God.\n\n### The Ladder of Yog\n\nIn this second context, **Yog** is like a ladder we climb to reach God. At the lowest rung, the soul is caught in worldliness, with the consciousness absorbed in mundane matter. The ladder of **Yog** takes the soul from that level to the stage where the consciousness is absorbed in the divine. The various rungs of the ladder have different names, but **Yog** is a term common to them all.\n\n### Types of Yog-ārurukṣhu and Yog-ārūḍha\n\n**Yog-ārurukṣhu** are those **sādhaks** who aspire for union with God and have just begun climbing the ladder. **Yog-ārūḍha** are those who have become elevated on the ladder.\n\n### Understanding Progress in Yog\n\nSo, how do we understand when one is elevated in the science of **Yog**? Shree Krishna explains this next."

    "explanation": "**Detachment from Material Desires in Yoga**\n\nAs the mind becomes attached to God in Yog, it naturally becomes detached from the world. So an easy criterion of evaluating the state of one’s mind is to check whether it has become free from all material desires.\n\n**Characteristics of Detachment**\n\nA person will be considered detached from the world when one no longer craves for sense objects nor is inclined to perform any actions for attaining them. Such a person ceases to look for opportunities to create circumstances to enjoy sensual pleasures, eventually extinguishes all thoughts of enjoying sense objects, and also dissolves the memories of previous enjoyments.\n\n**The Mind's Behavior**\n\nThe mind now no longer gushes into self-centered activities at the urge of the senses. When we achieve this level of mastery over the mind, we will be considered elevated in Yog.\n\n**Elevating to a Higher Level of Mastery**\n\nBy letting go of material desires and attachments, we elevate our minds to a higher level of mastery, where:\n\n*   We no longer crave for sense objects\n*   We are not inclined to perform any actions for attaining them\n*   We cease to look for opportunities to create circumstances to enjoy sensual pleasures\n*   We extinguish all thoughts of enjoying sense objects\n*   We dissolve the memories of previous enjoyments\n\nIn this state, our minds are free from self-centered activities and are focused on a higher purpose."

    "explanation": "**The Path to God-Realization**\n\nWe are responsible for our own elevation or debasement. Nobody can traverse the path of God-realization for us. Saints and Gurus show us the way, but we have to travel it ourselves.\n\n### A Slogan from Hindi\n\n\"There are two birds sitting on a tree—one Guru and one disciple. The Guru will descend by his own works, and the disciple will also only be able to climb down by his own karmas.\"\n\n**Understanding the Importance of Saints and Gurus**\n\nWe have had innumerable lifetimes before this one, and God-realized Saints were always present on Earth. At any period of time, if the world is devoid of such Saints, then the souls of that period cannot become God-realized. How then can they fulfill the purpose of human life, which is God-realization? Thus, God ensures that God-realized Saints are always present in every era, to guide the sincere seekers and inspire humanity.\n\n### The Role of Saints and Gurus in Our Lives\n\nSo, in infinite past lifetimes, many times we must have met God-realized Saints and yet we did not become God-realized. This means that the problem was not lack of proper guidance, but either our reticence in accepting it or working according to it. Thus, we must first accept responsibility for our present level of spirituality, or lack thereof. Only then will we gain the confidence that if we have brought ourselves to our present state, we can also elevate ourselves by our efforts.\n\n### The Enemy Within\n\nWhen we suffer reversals on the path of spiritual growth, we tend to complain that others have caused havoc to us, and they are our enemies. However, our biggest enemy is our own mind. It is the saboteur that thwarts our aspirations for perfection.\n\n### The Nature of the Mind\n\nShree Krishna states that, on the one hand, as the greatest benefactor of the soul, the mind has the potential of giving us the most benefit; on the other hand, as our greatest adversary, it also has the potential for causing the maximum harm. A controlled mind can accomplish many beneficial endeavors, whereas an uncontrolled mind can degrade the consciousness with most ignoble thoughts.\n\n### Understanding the Mind's Nature\n\nIn order to be able to use it as a friend, it is important to understand the mind's nature. Our mind operates at four levels:\n\n*   **Mind (Mana):** When it creates thoughts, we call it `mana`, or the mind.\n*   **Intellect (Buddhi):** When it analyzes and decides, we call it `buddhi`, or intellect.\n*   **Chitta:** When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it `chitta`.\n*   **Ego (Ahankār):** When it identifies with the bodily identifications and becomes proud of things like wealth, status, beauty, and learning, we call it `ahankār`, or ego.\n\n### The Interconnectedness of the Mind's Levels\n\nThese are not four separate entities. They are simply four levels of functioning of the one mind. Hence, we may refer to them all together as the mind, or as the mind-intellect, or as the mind-intellect-ego, or as the mind-intellect-chitta-ego. They all refer to the same thing.\n\n### The Mind's Apparatus\n\nThe use of the word ego here is different from its connotation in Freudian psychology. Sigmund Freud proposed the first theory of psychology regarding how the mind works. According to him, the ego is the \"real self\" that bridges the gap between our untamed desires (Id) and the value system that is learnt during childhood (Superego).\n\n### The Mind in Various Scriptures\n\nVarious scriptures describe the mind in one of these four ways for the purpose of explaining the concepts presented there. They are all referring to the same internal apparatus within us, which is together called `antaḥ karaṇ`, or the mind. For example:\n\n*   The Pañchadaśhī refers to all four together as the mind, and states that it is the cause of material bondage.\n*   In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly talks of the mind and the intellect as being two things, and emphasizes the need to surrender both to God.\n*   The Yog Darśhan talks of three entities: mind, intellect, and ego.\n*   Shankaracharya classifies the mind into four—mind, intellect, `chitta`, and ego.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo, when Shree Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self, he means we must use the higher mind to elevate the lower mind. In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. How this can be done has been explained in detail in verses 2.41 to 2.44 and again in verse 3.43."

    "verseNum": "6.6",
    "explanation": "**The Power of Thoughts: A Vedic Perspective**\n\n6.6 We dissipate a large portion of our thought power and energy in combating people whom we perceive as enemies and potentially harmful to us. The Vedic scriptures say the biggest enemies—lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.—reside in our own mind. These internal enemies are even more pernicious than the outer ones. The external demons may injure us for some time, but the demons sitting within our own mind have the ability to make us live in constant wretchedness. We all know people who had everything favorable in the world, but lived miserable lives because their own mind tormented them incessantly through depression, hatred, tension, anxiety, and stress.\n\n### The Ramification of Thoughts\n\nThe Vedic philosophy lays great emphasis on the ramification of thoughts. Illness is not only caused by viruses and bacteria, but also by the negativities we harbor in the mind. If someone accidentally throws a stone at you, it may hurt for a few minutes, but by the next day, you will probably have forgotten about it. However, if someone says something unpleasant, it may continue to agitate your mind for years. This is the immense power of the thoughts.\n\n**The Buddha's Words**\n\nIn the Buddhist scripture, the Dhammapada (1.3), the Buddha also expresses this truth vividly:\n\n“I have been insulted! I have been hurt! I have been beaten! I have been robbed! Misery does not cease in those who harbor such thoughts.”\n\n### The Power of Nourishing Hatred\n\nWhen we nourish hatred in our mind, our negative thoughts do more damage to us than the object of our hatred. It has been very sagaciously stated: “Resentment is like drinking poison and hoping that the other person dies.” The problem is that most people do not even realize that their own uncontrolled mind is causing them so much harm. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj advises:\n\n### **mana ko mano shatru usaki sunahu jani kachhu pyare** (Sadhan Bhakti Tattva)\n\n(Sadhan Bhakti Tattva)\n“Dear spiritual aspirant, look on your uncontrolled mind as your enemy. Do not come under its sway.”\n\n### The Potential of the Mind\n\nHowever, the same mind has the potential of becoming our best friend, if we bring it under control of the intellect, through spiritual practice. The more powerful an entity is, the greater is the danger of its misuse, and also the greater is the scope for its utilization. Since the mind is such a powerful machine fitted into our bodies, it can work as a two-edged sword. Thus, those who slide to demoniac levels do so because of their own mind while those who attain sublime heights also do so because of their purified minds.\n\n**The Mind as a Two-Edged Sword**\n\nAccordingly, Franklin D. Roosevelt, former President of America, expressed this very nicely: “Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.” In this verse, Shree Krishna enlightens Arjun about the potential harm and benefits our mind can bestow upon us.\n\n### **The Potential of Uncontrolled vs. Purified Mind**\n\nIn the following three verses, Shree Krishna describes the symptoms of one who is yog-aru?ha (advanced in Yog)."

    "explanation": "**The Mind's Experience of Dualities**\n=====================================\n\n6.7 Shree Krishna explained in verse 2.14 that the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives the mind the experience of heat and cold, joy and sorrow. As long as the mind has not been subdued, a person chases after the sensual perceptions of pleasure and recoils from the perceptions of pain.\n\n**The Nature of the Mind's Perceptions**\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe yogi who conquers the mind is able to see these fleeting perceptions as the workings of the bodily senses, distinct from the immortal soul, and thus, remain unmoved by them. Such an advanced yogi rises above the dualities of heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.\n\n### The Two Realms of the Mind's Existence\n\nThere are only two realms in which the mind may dwell—one is the realm of Maya and the other is the realm of God. If the mind rises above the sensual dualities of the world, it can easily get absorbed in God.\n\n**The State of Samādhi**\n----------------------\n\nShree Krishna has stated that an advanced yogi’s mind becomes situated in **samādhi** (deep meditation) upon God. This state allows the yogi to transcend the mind's perceptions of heat and cold, joy and sorrow, and ultimately, rise above the dualities of the world."

    "explanation": "**6.8 Jñāna**\n\n### Definition of Knowledge (Jñāna)\n\nJñāna, or knowledge, is the theoretical understanding obtained by listening to the Guru and from the study of the scriptures. \n\n**Vijñāna: Realization of Knowledge**\n\nVijñāna is the realization of that knowledge as an internal awakening and wisdom from within. The intellect of the advanced yogi becomes illumined by both jñāna and vijñāna.\n\n**Effects of Jñāna and Vijñāna**\n\nEquipped with wisdom, the yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the material energy. Such a yogi does not differentiate between objects based on their attractiveness to the self.\n\n**Perspective of the Enlightened Yogi**\n\nThe enlightened yogi sees all things in their relationship with God. Since the material energy belongs to God, all things are meant for his service.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n### Kṭastha\n\nThe word kṭastha refers to one who distances the mind from the fluctuating perceptions of senses in contact with the material energy, neither seeking pleasurable situations nor avoiding unpleasurable ones.\n\n### Vijitendriya\n\nVijitendriya is one who has subjugated the senses.\n\n### Yukt\n\nThe word yukt means one who is in constant communion with the Supreme. Such person begins tasting the divine bliss of God, and hence becomes a tṛiptātmā, or one fully satisfied by virtue of realized knowledge.\n\n**Benefits of Realized Knowledge**\n\nSuch a person begins tasting the divine bliss of God, and hence becomes a tṛiptātmā (one fully satisfied by virtue of realized knowledge)."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of the Human Mind and Elevated Yoga**\n\nIt is the nature of the human mind to respond differently to friends and foes. But an elevated yogi's nature is different. Endowed with realized knowledge of God, the elevated yogi sees the whole creation in its unity with God. Thus, they are able to see all living beings with equality of vision. This parity of vision is also of various levels:\n\n### Levels of Vision\n\n*   **All living beings are divine souls, and hence parts of God.** \n    Thus, they are viewed as equal.\n\n*   **A true Pundit is one who sees everyone as the soul, and hence similar to oneself.**\n\n*   **Higher is the vision: God is seated in everyone, and hence all are equally respect worthy.**\n\nAt the highest level, the yogi develops the vision: \n*   **Everyone is the form of God.**\n\nThe Vedic scriptures repeatedly state that the whole world is a veritable form of God:\n\n### The Form of God\n\n*   **īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat**\n\n    (Īśhopaniṣhad 1)\n\n*   **“The entire universe, with all its living and non-living beings is the manifestation of the Supreme Being, who dwells within it.”** \n\n*   **puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ**\n\n    (Puruṣh Sūktam)\n\n*   **“God is everywhere in this world, and everything is his energy.”** \n\nHence, the highest yogi sees everyone as the manifestation of God. Endowed with this level of vision, Hanuman says:\n\n*   **sīyā rāma maya saba jaga jānī**\n\n    (Ramayan)\n\n*   **“I see the face of Sita Ram in everyone.”**\n\n### Categories of Vision\n\nThese categories have been further detailed in the commentary to verse 6.31. Referring to all three of the above categories, Shree Krishna says that the yogi who can maintain an equal vision toward all persons is even more elevated than the yogi mentioned in the previous verse.\n\n### Achieving a State of Yoga\n\nHaving described the state of Yog, starting with the next verse, Shree Krishna describes the practice by which we can achieve that state."

    "explanation": "**6.10 Self-Preparation for Spiritual Mastery**\n\nHaving stated the characteristics of one who has attained the state of Yog, Shree Krishna now talks about the self-preparation required for it. Mastery in any field requires daily practice.\n\n### The Importance of Daily Practice\n\nAn Olympic swimming champion is not one who goes to the local neighborhood swimming pool once a week on Saturday evenings. Only one who practices for several hours every day achieves the mastery required to win the Olympics.\n\n#### Practice is Essential for Spiritual Mastery\n\nPractice is essential for spiritual mastery as well. Shree Krishna now explains the process of accomplishing spiritual mastery by recommending the daily practice of meditation.\n\n### The First Point: Finding a Secluded Place\n\nThe first point he mentions is the need for a secluded place. All day long, we are usually surrounded by a worldly environment; these material activities, people, and conversations, all tend to make the mind more worldly.\n\n#### An Analogy to Understand the Concept\n\nThe analogy of milk and water can help elucidate this point. If milk is poured into water, it cannot retain its undiluted identity, for water naturally mixes with it.\n\nHowever, if the milk is kept separate from water and converted into yogurt, and then the yogurt is churned to extract butter, the butter becomes immiscible.\n\nIt can now challenge the water, \"I will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.\" Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water.\n\nIn contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly. However, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God.\n\n### The Instruction on Seclusion\n\nOnce sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, \"I will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.\"\n\nThis instruction for seclusion has been repeated by Shree Krishna in verse 18.52: \n\nvivikt sevī laghvāśhī \n “Live in a secluded place; control your diet.”\n\n### Practically Applying the Instruction\n\nThere is a beautiful way of practically applying this instruction without disturbing our professional and social works.\n\nIn our daily schedule, we can allocate some time for \n**sādhanā**\n, or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances.\n\nShutting ourselves out from the world, we should do \n**sādhanā**\nto purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God.\n\n### The Benefits of Daily Practice\n\nIf we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities.\n\nIn this manner we will be able to retain the elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during the daily \n**sādhanā**\nin isolation from the world."

In the initial stages, the external environment does impact the mind.\n\n**Impact of External Environment on Mind**\nIn later stages of sādhanā, one is able to achieve internal purity even in dirty and unclean places. But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well.\n\n### Benefits of a Clean Environment for Meditation\n\nA mat of Kuśh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation.\n\n**Considerations for the External Seating Arrangement**\n\nIf the āsan is too high, there is the risk of falling off; if the āsan is too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground.\n\n### Adaptability of Instructions to Modern Times\n\nSome instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same."

This happens because the material mind does not initially get as much bliss in contemplation on God as it does while relishing sense objects. This creates the possibility for the mind to become languid when focused on God. Hence, you do not find people dozing off half-way through their meal, but you do see people falling asleep during meditation and the chanting of God’s names.\n\n### Instruction to Sit Erect\n\nTo avoid this, Shree Krishna gives the instruction to sit erect. The Brahma Sūtra also states three aphorisms regarding the posture for meditation:\n#### Āsīnaḥ Sambhavāt (4.1.7)\n\"To do sādhanā, seat yourself properly.\"\n\n#### Achalatvaṁ Chāpekṣhya (4.1.9)\n\"Ensure that you sit erect and still.\"\n\n#### Dhyānāccha (4.1.8)\n\"Seated in this manner, focus the mind in meditation.\"\n\n### Meditative Āsans\n\nThere are a number of meditative āsans described in the Hath Yoga Pradeepika, such as:\n*   Padmasan\n*   Ardha Padmasan\n*   Dhyanveer āsan\n*   Siddhasan\n*   Sukhasan\n\n#### Adopting a Comfortable Posture\n\nWe may adopt any āsan in which we can comfortably sit, without moving, during the period of the meditation. Maharshi Patañjali states:\n#### Sthira Sukhamāsanam (Patañjali Yog Sūtra 2.46)\n\"To practice meditation, sit motionless in any posture that you are comfortable in.\"\n\n#### Accommodating Individual Needs\n\nSome people are unable to sit on the floor due to knee problems, etc. They should not feel discouraged, for they can even practice meditation while sitting on a chair, provided they fulfill the condition of sitting motionless and erect.\n\n### Focusing the Eyes\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna states that the eyes should be made to focus on the tip of the nose, and prevented from wandering. As a variation, the eyes can also be kept closed. Both these techniques will be helpful in blocking out worldly distractions.\n\n### The Journey Within\n\nThe external seat and posture do need to be appropriate, but meditation is truly a journey within us. Through meditation, we can reach deep within and cleanse the mind of endless lifetimes of dross. By learning to hold the mind in concentration, we can work upon it to harness its latent potential.\n\n### Benefits of Meditation\n\nThe practice of meditation helps organize our personality, awaken our inner consciousness, and expand our self-awareness. The spiritual benefits of meditation are described later, in the purport on verse 6.15.\n\n### Some of the Side Benefits\n\nSome of the side benefits are:\n\n*   **Reining in the Unbridled Mind**: It reins the unbridled mind, and harnesses the thought energy to attain difficult goals.\n*   **Maintaining Mental Balance**: It helps maintain mental balance in the midst of adverse circumstances.\n*   **Developing a Strong Resolve**: It aids in the development of a strong resolve that is necessary for success in life.\n*   **Eliminating Bad Sanskārs**: It enables one to eliminate bad sanskārs and habits, and cultivate good qualities."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Celibacy for Success in Meditation**\n===========================================================\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes the practice of celibacy for success in meditation. The sexual desire facilitates the process of procreation in the animal kingdom, and animals indulge in it primarily for that purpose. In most species, there is a particular mating season; animals do not indulge in sexual activity wantonly.\n\n### Human Behavior and Celibacy\n\nSince humans have greater intellects and the freedom to indulge at will, the activity of procreation is converted into a means of licentious enjoyment. However, the Vedic scriptures lay great emphasis on practicing celibacy.\n\n**Celibacy According to Yog Sutras**\n------------------------------------\n\nMaharshi Patanjali states:\n\n> brahmacharya pratiṣhṭhāyāṁ vīrya lābhaḥ\n> (Yog Sūtras 2.38)[v9]\n>\n> “The practice of celibacy leads to great enhancement of energy.”\n\n**Ayurveda and Celibacy**\n------------------------\n\nAyurveda, the Indian science of medicine extolls brahmacharya (the practice of celibacy) for its exceptional health benefits.\n\n### Health Benefits of Celibacy\n\nOne of the students of Dhanvantari approached his teacher after finishing his full course of Ayurveda and asked: “O Sage, now kindly let me know the secret of health.”\n\nDhanvantari replied: “This seminal energy is verily the ātman. The secret of health lies in preservation of this vital force. He who wastes this vital and precious energy cannot have physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development.”\n\n**The Effects of Wasting Semen**\n---------------------------------\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, forty drops of blood go into making one drop of semen. Those who waste their semen develop unsteady and agitated prāṇ. They lose their physical and mental energy, and weaken their memory, mind, and intellect.\n\n**The Benefits of Celibacy**\n---------------------------\n\nThe practice of celibacy leads to a boost of bodily energy, clarity of intellect, gigantic will power, retentive memory, and a keen spiritual intellect. It creates a sparkle in the eyes and a luster on the cheeks.\n\n**The Definition of Celibacy**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe definition of celibacy is not restricted to mere abstinence from physical indulgence. The Agni Purāṇ states that the eightfold activities related to sex must be controlled:\n\n*   Thinking about it\n*   Talking about it\n*   Joking about it\n*   Envisioning it\n*   Desiring it\n*   Wooing to get someone interested in it\n*   Enticing someone interested in it\n*   Engaging in it\n\nFor one to be considered celibate, all these must be shunned. Thus, celibacy not only requires abstinence from sexual intercourse, but also refrainment from masturbation, homosexual acts, and all other sexual practices.\n\n**The Object of Meditation**\n------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna states here that the object of meditation should be God alone.\n\nThis point is again reiterated in the next verse."

    "explanation": "**Varieties of Techniques for Meditation**\n=============================================\n\nMeditation is a vast and diverse practice that encompasses various techniques, each with its unique characteristics and benefits. In the world of meditation, numerous schools and traditions have evolved over time, such as Zen, Buddhist, Tantric, Taoist, Vedic, and others. Each of these schools has its own set of sub-branches and nuances.\n\n**A Question on the Right Technique**\n-------------------------------------\n\nAmongst the followers of Hinduism, an innumerable number of techniques are being practiced. This raises a question: which technique should we adopt for our personal practice? Shree Krishna makes this riddle easy to solve by stating that the object of meditation should be God himself and God alone.\n\n**The Aim of Meditation**\n-------------------------\n\nThe aim of meditation is not merely to enhance concentration and focus, but also to purify the mind. Meditating on the breath, chakras, void, flame, etc., is helpful in developing focus. However, the purification of the mind is only possible when we fix it upon an all-pure object, which is God himself. Verse 14.26 states that God is beyond the three modes of material nature, and when one fixes the mind upon him, it too rises above the three modes. Thus, meditating upon the prāṇas may be called transcendental by its practitioners, but true transcendental meditation is upon God alone.\n\n**Fixing the Mind Upon God**\n-----------------------------\n\nSo, how can we fix our mind upon God? We can make all of God's divine attributes—names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, associates—the objects of meditation. These attributes are all non-different from God and replete with all his energies.\n\n### Making the Name of God the Basis of Contemplation\n\nIn various bhakti traditions in India, meditation is often focused on the name of God. This is illustrated by the Ramayan verse:\n\nbrahma rām teṅ nāmu baṛa, bara dāyaka bara dāni\n\n\"God's name is bigger than God himself, in terms of its utility to the souls.\"\n\nThis makes the name a convenient way of remembering God, as it can be taken anywhere and everywhere.\n\n### Rūp Dhyān Meditation\n\nHowever, for most sādhaks, the name by itself is not sufficiently attractive for enchanting the mind. The mind's natural tendency to focus on forms can be harnessed by using the form of God as the basis for meditation. This is called rūp dhyān (form meditation).\n\n### Enhancing Focus with Virtues and Service\n\nOnce the mind is focused upon the form of God, we can further enhance it by contemplating upon the virtues of God—his compassion, his beauty, his knowledge, his love, his benevolence, his grace, and so on. This can be done by serving God in the mind through various activities such as offering foodstuffs, worshipping him, singing to him, massaging him, fanning him, bathing him, cooking for him, etc. This is called mānasī sevā (serving God in the mind).\n\n**The Ultimate Benefits of Meditation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAt the end of this verse, Shree Krishna gives us the ultimate benefits of meditation. These are liberation from Maya and the everlasting beatitude of God-realization."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Balancing Physical and Spiritual Well-being in Yoga**\n\nAfter describing the object of meditation and the end-goal achieved by it, Shree Krishna gives some regulations to follow. He states that those who break the rules of bodily maintenance cannot be successful in Yog. Often beginners on the path, with their incomplete wisdom state: “You are the soul and not this body. So simply engage in spiritual activity, forgetting about the maintenance of the body.”\n\nHowever, such a philosophy cannot get one too far. It is true that we are not the body, yet the body is our carrier as long as we live, and we are obliged to take care of it. The Ayurvedic text, Charak Samhitā states:\n\nśharīra mādhyaṁ khalu dharma sādhanam \n[v11] “The body is the vehicle for engaging in religious activity.” If the body becomes unwell, then spiritual pursuits get impeded too.\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\ntanu binu bhajana veda nahiṅ varanā \n[v12] “The Vedas do not recommend that we ignore the body, while engaging in spirituality.” In fact, they instruct us to take good care of our body with the help of material science.\n\nThe Īśhopaniṣhad states:\n\nandhaṁ tamaḍ praviśhanti ye ’vidyām upāsate\ntato bhūya iva te tamo ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ\n (9)[v13]\n“Those who cultivate only material science go to hell. But those who cultivate only spiritual science go to an even darker hell.” \n\nMaterial science is necessary for the maintenance of our body, while spiritual science is necessary for the manifestation of the internal divinity within us. We must balance both in our lives to reach the goal of life.\n\n**Key Principles for Balancing Physical and Spiritual Well-being in Yoga**\n\n*   **Yoga Āns**: Yoga āns is one of the essential practices in yoga, which involves uniting the consciousness with a sense of awareness.\n*   **Prāṇāyām**: Prāṇāyām is a set of practices in yoga that help control the breath and calm the mind.\n*   **Science of Proper Diet**: The science of proper diet is an essential part of Vedic knowledge, which teaches us about the importance of eating fresh nutritious food.\n\n**The Role of Ayurveda in Maintaining Physical Health**\n\n*   **Ayurveda**: Ayurveda is the hoary science of medicine and good health, which is associated with the Atharva Veda.\n*   **Importance of Ayurveda**: Ayurveda plays a significant role in maintaining physical health, as it teaches us about the importance of eating fresh nutritious food.\n\n**Consequences of Neglecting Physical Health**\n\n*   **Neglecting the Body**: Neglecting the body can lead to spiritual pursuits getting impeded.\n*   **Consequences of Overeating or Not Eating**: Overeating or not eating at all, extreme activity or complete inactivity, etc. are all impediments to Yog.\n*   **Importance of Balancing Physical and Spiritual Well-being**: We must balance both in our lives to reach the goal of life.\n\n**Tips for Maintaining Physical Health**\n\n*   **Eating Fresh Nutritious Food**: Eating fresh nutritious food is essential for maintaining physical health.\n*   **Doing Daily Exercise**: Doing daily exercise can help maintain physical health and balance spiritual pursuits.\n*   **Getting the Right Amount of Sleep**: Getting the right amount of sleep every night can help maintain physical health and balance spiritual pursuits.\n*   **Spiritual Practitioners Should Take Care of Their Body**: Spiritual practitioners should take good care of their body, by eating fresh nutritious food, doing daily exercise, and getting the right amount of sleep every night."

    "explanation": "**The Yearning for Bliss: A Fundamental Aspect of the Human Soul**\n\n### The Nature of God as an Ocean of Bliss\n\nThe yearning for bliss is intrinsic to the nature of the soul. It stems from the fact that we are tiny parts of God, who is an ocean of bliss. This concept has been established in the Vedic scriptures, as evident from various quotations mentioned in verse 5.21.\n\n**Quotations from the Vedic Scriptures**\n\n* \"Rasa vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā nandī bhavati\" (Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 2.7) - \"The bliss that is obtained by loving God, is the greatest bliss.\"\n* “God is bliss himself; the individual soul becomes blissful on attaining him.” (Brahma Sūtra 1.1.12)\n* “God is the veritable form of bliss.” (Brahma Sūtra 1.1.12)\n* \"Satya jñānānantānanda mātraika rasa mūrtayaḥ\" (Bhāgavatam 10.13.54) - \"The divine form of God is made of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.\"\n* “God, who is the ocean of bliss, is seated within you. Without knowing him, how can your thirst for happiness be satiated?” (Ramayan)\n\n### The Nature of God Beyond Sensory Perceptions\n\nWe have been seeking perfect bliss for eons, and everything we do is in search of that bliss. However, from the objects of gratification, the mind and senses perceive only a shadowy reflection of true bliss. This sensual gratification fails to satisfy the longing of the soul within, which yearns for the infinite bliss of God.\n\n### The Experience of Bliss in Union with God\n\nWhen the mind is in union with God, the soul experiences the ineffable and sublime bliss beyond the scope of the senses. This state is called **samādhi** in the Vedic scriptures.\n\n#### The Importance of Surrender in Samādhi\n\nAccording to Sage Patanjali:\n\"Samādhisiddhirīśhvara praṇidhānāt\" (Patañjali Yog Darśhan 2.45) - \"For success in **samādhi**, surrender to the Supreme Lord.\"\n\n#### The State of Samādhi\n\nIn the state of **samādhi**, experiencing complete satisfaction and contentment, the soul has nothing left to desire, and thus becomes firmly situated in the Absolute Truth, without deviating from it for even a moment."

    "explanation": "**The Infinite Bliss of God**\n\n### No Extent of Attainment Satisfies a Person Totally\n\nIn the material realm, no extent of attainment satiates a person totally. A poor person strives hard to become rich, and feels satisfied if he or she is able to become a millionaire. But when that same millionaire looks at a billionaire, discontentment sets in again. The billionaire is also discontented by looking at an even richer person. No matter what happiness we get, when we perceive a higher state of happiness, the feeling of unfulfillment lingers. But happiness achieved from the state of Yog is the infinite bliss of God. Since there is nothing higher than that, on experiencing that infinite bliss, the soul naturally perceives that it has reached its goal.\n\n### Eternal Bliss of God\n\nGod's divine bliss is also eternal, and it can never be snatched away from the yogi who has attained it once. Such a God-realized soul, though residing in the material body, remains in the state of divine consciousness. Sometimes, externally, it seems that the Saint is facing tribulations in the form of illness, antagonistic people, and oppressive environment, but internally the Saint retains divine consciousness and continues to relish the bliss of God. Thus, even the biggest difficulty cannot shake such a Saint.\n\n### Unbreakable Union with God\n\nEstablished in union with God, the Saint rises above bodily consciousness and is thus not affected by bodily harm. We hear from the Puranas how Prahlad was put in a pit of snakes, tortured with weapons, placed in the fire, thrown off a cliff, etc. but none of these difficulties could break Prahlad's devotional union with God.\n\n### The Nature of God-Realized Souls\n\nA God-realized soul, having attained the infinite bliss of God, remains in a state of eternal bliss. This bliss is not dependent on external circumstances and cannot be taken away. Such souls are not affected by worldly difficulties, but rather continue to experience the infinite bliss of God."

    "explanation": "**The Material World as Maya**\n================================\n\n### The Realm of Suffering\n\n6.23 The material world is the realm of Maya, and it has been termed by Shree Krishna in verse 8.15 as \nduḥkhālayam aśhāśhvatam\n, or temporary and full of misery. Thus, the material energy Maya is compared to darkness. It has put us in the darkness of ignorance and is making us suffer in the world.\n\n### The Power of God's Light\n\nHowever, the darkness of Maya naturally gets dispelled when we bring the light of God into our heart. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states this very beautifully:\nkṛiṣhṇa sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakāra\n yāhāñ kṛiṣhṇa, tāhāñ nāhi māyāra adhikāra\n(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela, 22.31)[v19]\n“God is like the light and Maya is like darkness. Just as darkness does not have the power to engulf light, similarly Maya can never overcome God.”\n\n### The Nature of God and Maya\n\nNow, the nature of God is divine bliss while the consequence of Maya is misery. Thus, one who attains the divine bliss of God can never be overcome by the misery of Maya again.\n\n### The State of Yog\n\nThus, the state of Yog implies both 1) attainment of bliss, and 2) freedom from misery. Shree Krishna emphasizes both successively.\n\n### The Path to Yog\n\nIn the previous verse, the attainment of bliss was highlighted as the result of Yog; in this verse, freedom from misery is being emphasized.\n\n### Determined Practice\n\nShree Krishna states that the stage of perfection has to be reached through determined practice.\n\n### The Practice of Meditation\n\nHe then goes on to explain how we must practice meditation."

This is described by Shree Krishna in the following verses.\n\n**Removing Thoughts from the World**\n\nThoughts of worldly things, people, events, etc. come to the mind when it is attached to the world. Initially, these thoughts are in the form of:\n\n*   **Sphurṇā** (flashes of feelings and ideas)\n*   As the mind insists on these thoughts, they become **Saṅkalp** (pursuit of these objects)\n*   Depending on the attachment, thoughts lead to **Saṅkalp** (pursuit) and **Vikalp** (revulsion from them)\n*   Both **Saṅkalp** and **Vikalp** create impressions on the mind, like the film of a camera exposed to light\n*   These impressions directly impede meditation upon God\n*   They also have a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that is a seed today can become an inferno tomorrow\n\n**Importance of Renouncing Attachment**\n\nTo achieve success in meditation, one should renounce the affinity for material objects. This is because attachment to worldly things creates a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that can become an inferno tomorrow.\n\n**The Second Part of the Process: Residing on God**\n\nShree Krishna then talks of the second part of the process—making the mind reside upon God. He says that this will not happen automatically, but with determined effort, success will come slowly.\n\n**Determining Resolve**\n\nDetermination of resolve that is in accordance with the scriptures is called **Dhṛiti**. This determination comes with conviction of the intellect.\n\nMany people acquire academic knowledge of the scriptures about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits. However, their daily life is at variance with their knowledge, and they are seen to indulge in sin, sex, and intoxication. This happens because their intellect is not convinced about that knowledge.\n\n**Pratyāhār: Control of the Mind and Senses**\n\nTo achieve success in **Pratyāhār** (control of the mind and senses), one must gradually cease sensual indulgence. This is called **Pratyāhār**, or control of the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses.\n\nSuccess in **Pratyāhār** will not come immediately. It will be achieved through gradual and repeated exercise.\n\n**The Exercise of Pratyāhār**\n\nShree Krishna explains that the exercise involved in **Pratyāhār** is:\n\n*   To gradually cease sensual indulgence\n*   Utilizing the intellect to understand the impermanence of the world and the eternality of one's relationship with God\n*   To control the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses"

Here, Shree Krishna begins by describing the first part of the process—taking the mind away from the world.\n\n### Thoughts of Worldly Things\n\nThoughts of worldly things, people, events, etc. come to the mind when it is attached to the world. Initially, the thoughts are in the form of **sphurṇā** (flashes of feelings and ideas). When we insist on the implementation of **sphurṇā**, it becomes **saṅkalp**. Thus, thoughts lead to **saṅkalp** (pursuit of these objects) and **vikalp** (revulsion from them), depending upon whether the attachment is positive or negative.\n\n**The Growth of Desire**\nThe seed of pursuit and revulsion grows into the plant of desire, \"This should happen. This should not happen.\" Both **saṅkalp** and **vikalp** immediately create impressions on the mind, like the film of a camera exposed to the light. Thus, they directly impede meditation upon God. They also have a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that is a seed today can become an inferno tomorrow.\n\n**Renouncing Affinity for Material Objects**\nOne who desires success in meditation should renounce the affinity for material objects. By doing so, we can remove the mind from the world and create an environment conducive to meditation.\n\n**The Second Part of the Meditation Process: Fixing the Mind on God**\n\nHaving described the first part of the process—removing the mind from the world—Shree Krishna then talks of the second part.

    "explanation": "**The Path to Meditation Success**\n=====================================\n\n**Understanding the Journey to Perfection**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSuccess in meditation is not achieved in a day; the path to perfection is long and arduous. When we sit for meditation with the resolve to focus our mind upon God, we will find that ever so often it wanders off in worldly thoughts and emotions.\n\n**The Three Steps Involved**\n-------------------------\n\n### Step 1: Removing the Mind from the World\n\nWith the intellect's power of discrimination, we decide that the world is not our goal. Hence, we forcefully remove the mind from the world. This requires effort.\n\n### Step 2: Bringing the Mind to Focus on God\n\nAgain, with the power of discrimination, we understand that God alone is ours, and God-realization is our goal. Hence, we bring the mind to focus upon God. This also requires effort.\n\n### Step 3: The Mind's Natural Detachment\n\nThe mind comes away from God, and wanders back into the world. This does not require effort; it happens automatically.\n\n**Dealing with Setbacks**\n-----------------------\n\nWhen the third step happens by itself, sādhaks often become disappointed. They say, \"I tried so hard to focus upon God, but the mind went back into the world.\" Shree Krishna asks us not to feel disappointed. He says, \"The mind is fickle and we should be prepared that it will wander off in the direction of its infatuation, despite our best efforts to control it.\"\n\n**Repeating the Process**\n-------------------------\n\nWhen the mind wanders off, we should once again repeat steps 1 and 2—take the mind away from the world and bring it back to God. Once again, we will experience that step 3 takes place by itself. We should not lose heart, and again repeat steps 1 and 2.\n\n**The Importance of Patience**\n-----------------------------\n\nWe will have to do this repeatedly. Then slowly, the mind's attachment toward God will start increasing. And simultaneously, its detachment from the world will also increase. As this happens, it will become easier and easier to meditate. But in the beginning, we must be prepared for the battle involved in disciplining the mind.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nMeditation success is not a one-day achievement but a long and arduous path. With patience, persistence, and the right approach, we can overcome the obstacles and achieve our goal of God-realization.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n----------------\n\n*   Focus on removing the mind from the world\n*   Bring the mind to focus on God through effort and discrimination\n*   Do not be discouraged by setbacks, repeat steps 1 and 2 when necessary\n*   Be patient and persistent in the process\n*   With time, the mind's attachment to God will increase, and its detachment from the world will also grow."

Earlier, effort was required to focus it upon God, but now it naturally runs to him.\n\n**The Elevated Meditator's Perspective**\n------------------------------------------\n\nAt this stage, the elevated meditator sees everything in its connection with God. Sage Narad states:\n\n> \"The consciousness of the devotee whose mind is united in love with God is always absorbed in him. Such a devotee always sees him, hears him, speaks of him, and thinks of him.\" - Nārad Bhakti Darśhan, Sūtra 55\n\n### Realization of the Devotee's Higher State\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the mind gets absorbed in God in this manner, the soul begins to experience a glimpse of the infinite bliss of God who is seated within.\n\n**Progressing on the Spiritual Path**\n--------------------------------------\n\nSādhaks often ask how they can know that they are progressing. The answer is embedded in this verse. When we find our inner transcendental bliss increasing, we can consider it as a symptom that our mind is coming under control and the consciousness is getting spiritually elevated.\n\n### A Marker of Progress\n-------------------------\n\nHere, Shree Krishna says that when we are:\n\n* **Śhānta-rajasaṁ** (free from passion)\n* **Akalmaṣham** (sinless)\nthen we will become:\n\n* **Brahma-bhūtam** (endowed with God-realization)\n\nAt that stage, we will experience:\n\n* **Sukham uttamam** (the highest bliss)\n\n### The Higher State of God Realization\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn this elevated state, the devotee experiences the highest bliss. The ultimate goal of spiritual practice is to realize this higher state and experience the infinite bliss of God who is seated within."

    "explanation": "**The Mind's Union with God**\n=====================================\n\nTo lose God means to let the mind wander away from him, and to be with him means to unite the mind with him. The easy way to unite the mind with God is to learn to see everything in its connection with him.\n\n**Understanding the Nature of the Mind**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nFor example, let us say that someone hurts us. It is the nature of the mind to develop sentiments of resentment, hatred, etc. toward anyone who harms us. However, if we permit that to happen, then our mind comes away from the divine realm, and the devotional union of our mind with God ceases.\n\n**Preventing Negative Sentiments**\n---------------------------------\n\nInstead, if we see the Supreme Lord seated in that person, we will think, “God is testing me through this person. He wants me to increase the virtue of tolerance, and that is why he is inspiring this person to behave badly with me. But I will not permit the incident to disturb me.” Thinking in this way, we will be able to prevent the mind from becoming a victim of negative sentiments.\n\n**Seeing God in All Connections**\n-----------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, the mind separates from God when it gets attached to a friend or relative. Now, if we train the mind to see God in that person, then each time the mind wanders toward him or her, we will think, “Shree Krishna is seated in this person, and thus I am feeling this attraction.” In this manner, the mind will continue to retain its devotional absorption in the Supreme.\n\n**Overcoming Lamentation**\n-------------------------\n\nSometimes, the mind laments over past incidents. This again separates the mind from the divine realm because lamentation takes the mind into the past and the present contemplation of God and Guru ceases.\n\n**Connecting Incidents to God**\n------------------------------\n\nNow if we see that incident in connection with God, we will think, “The Lord deliberately arranged for me to experience tribulation in the world, so that I may develop detachment. He is so concerned about my welfare that he mercifully arranges for the proper circumstances that are beneficial for my spiritual progress.” By thinking thus, we will be able to protect our devotional focus.\n\n**The Wisdom of Sage Narad**\n---------------------------\n\nSage Narad states:\n\nloka hānau chintā na kāryā niveditātma loka vedatvāt \n(Nārad Bhakti Darshan, Sūtra 61[v23])\n“When you suffer a reversal in the world, do not lament or brood over it. See the grace of God in that incident.”\n\n**The Practice Stage**\n----------------------\n\nOur self-interest lies in somehow or the other keeping the mind in God, and the simple trick to accomplish this is to see God in everything and everyone. That is the practice stage, which slowly leads to the perfection that is mentioned in this verse, where we are never lost to God and he is never lost to us."

Thus, in verse 5.18, Shree Krishna states: “The truly learned, with the eyes of divine knowledge, see with equal vision a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.”\n\n*   They perceive individuals based on their spiritual essence.\n*   This is the level of perception seen by those who have gained a higher understanding of reality.\n\n**The Elevated Yogis**\n\nThe elevated yogis in even higher consciousness see God seated as the Supreme Soul in everyone.

It is restless because it keeps flitting in different directions, from subject to subject. It is turbulent because it creates upheavals in one’s consciousness, in the form of hatred, anger, lust, greed, envy, anxiety, fear, attachment, etc. It is strong because it overpowers the intellect with its vigorous currents and destroys the faculty of discrimination.\n\nThe mind is also obstinate because when it catches a harmful thought, it refuses to let go, and continues to ruminate over it again and again, even to the dismay of the intellect. Thus enumerating its unwholesome characteristics, Arjun declares that the mind is even more difficult to control than the wind. It is a powerful analogy for no one can ever think of controlling the mighty wind in the sky.\n\n\n**The Mind as Attracted by Krishna**\n\nIn this verse, Arjun has addressed the Lord as Krishna. The word “Krishna” means:\n\n**karṣhati yogināṁ paramahansānāṁ chetānsi iti kṛṣhṇaḥ**\n\n[v25]\n\n“Krishna is he who forcefully attracts the minds of even the most powerfully-minded yogis and paramahansas.”\n\nArjun is thus indicating that Krishna should also attract his restless, turbulent, strong, and obstinate mind."

Can you not defeat the mind?\"\n\n**Shree Krishna's Response to Arjun's Statement**\n\nShree Krishna does not deny the problem, by saying, \"Arjun, what nonsense are you speaking? The mind can be controlled very easily.\" Rather, he agrees with Arjun's statement that the mind is indeed difficult to control. However, so many things are difficult to achieve in the world and yet we remain undaunted and move forward. For example, sailors know that the sea is dangerous and the possibility of terrible storms exists. Yet, they have never found those dangers as sufficient reasons for remaining ashore.\n\n**The Importance of Vairāgya and Abhyās**\n\nShree Krishna assures Arjun that the mind can be controlled by **vairāgya** and **abhyās**.\n\n### Vairāgya\n\n**Vairāgya** means detachment. We observe that the mind runs toward the objects of its attachment, toward the direction it has been habituated to running in the past. The elimination of attachment eradicates the unnecessary wanderings of the mind.\n\n### Abhyās\n\n**Abhyās** means practice, or a concerted and persistent effort to change an old habit or develop a new one. Practice is a very important word for **sādhaks**.

He says that those who have not learnt to bridle the mind through:\n\n*   **Abhyās** (meditative practices)\n*   **Vairāgya** (detachment)\n\nfind great difficulty in the practice of Yog. But those who have brought the mind under their control through persistent effort can achieve success by adopting the proper means. The perfect process has already been described by him from verses 6.10 to 6.32.\n\n### The Perfect Process of Yog\n\nThe perfect process includes:\n\n1.  **Subduing the senses**: One must control the senses to avoid distractions and stay focused on the ultimate goal of Yog.\n2.  **Giving up all desires**: Detaching oneself from worldly attachments and desires is essential for achieving inner peace and spiritual growth.\n3.  **Focusing the mind upon God alone**: Concentrating one's thoughts on a higher power or ultimate reality helps to quiet the mind and achieve mental clarity.\n4.  **Thinking of him with an unwavering mind**: Cultivating a strong and steady mindset, one can focus on the divine and experience spiritual growth.\n5.  **Seeing everyone with equal vision**: Developing a sense of unity and interconnectedness with all beings, one can transcend the limitations of individual ego.\n\n### Arjun's Doubt and Shree Krishna's Response\n\nThis statement creates a doubt in Arjun’s mind regarding the sādhak who is unable to control the mind, and he now questions Shree Krishna in this regard."

Here, by displaying his affection and grace toward Arjun, Shree Krishna wishes to indicate that God takes care of those who tread on his path.\n\n### The Devotee's Assurance\n\nThey are dear to God because they engage in the most auspicious kind of activity, and “the doer of good never comes to grief.” This verse asserts that God preserves the devotee both in this world and the world hereafter.

Whatever spiritual assets we had accumulated in the past life—detachment, wisdom, devotion, faith, tolerance, determination, etc.—are known to him. So, at the appropriate time, he gives us the fruits of our past efforts and enhances our spirituality from within, in accordance with our previous attainments. This explains why some people harboring materialistic views suddenly become deeply spiritual. When their spiritual **sanskārs** awaken, they get the benefit of their **sādhanā** of previous lives.\n\n### The Role of Past-Life Spiritual Assets\n\nA traveler may break journey to rest the night in a hotel on the wayside. But when he wakes up, he does not need to again tread the distance already covered. He simply moves ahead to cover the remaining distance. Likewise, by God’s grace, the yogi of past lives receives the previous spiritual assets accumulated, to be able to continue the journey where he had left off, like someone who has woken up from sleep. That is why such a yogi never gets lost.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   God knows our past-life spiritual assets and gives us the benefits of those efforts when we are ready.\n*   Our previous attainments guide our future spiritual growth and development.\n*   The benefits of past-life efforts can manifest suddenly, leading us to become deeply spiritual when we least expect it.\n*   The yogi who has accumulated spiritual assets in past lives never gets lost because they have a clear understanding of their journey and its purpose."

Jñānī\nA jñānī is a person of learning who actively engages in the cultivation of knowledge.\n\n#### 3. Karmī\nA karmī is one who performs the Vedic rituals for attaining material opulence and the celestial abodes.\n\n### The Superior Being\nShree Krishna declares the yogi to be superior to them all.

The yogi, on the other hand, is striving not for the world, but for God.\n\n#### The Superior Accomplishment\nAs a result, the yogi’s accomplishment is at the spiritual platform and is superior to them all.

    "explanation": "### Verse Explanation: Bhakti Yog as the Highest Form of Yoga\n\n#### The Debate Over Which Form of Yoga is the Highest\n\nEven amongst yogis, there are various forms of yoga, such as karm yogis, bhakti yogis, jñāna yogis, aṣhṭāṅg yogis, and others. This verse puts to rest the debate about which form of yoga is the highest.\n\n#### Shree Krishna's Declaration\n\nShree Krishna declares that the bhakti yogi is the highest, superior to even the best aṣhṭāṅg yogi and haṭha yogi. The reason for this is that bhakti, or devotion, is the highest power of God.\n\n#### The Power of Devotion\n\nIt is such a power that binds God and makes him a slave of his devotee. Thus, he states in the Bhāgavatam:\n\n> \"Although I am supremely independent, yet I become enslaved by my devotees. They conquer my heart. What to speak of my devotees, even the devotees of my devotees are very dear to me.\"\n\n— Bhāgavatam 9.4.63\n\nThe bhakti yogi possesses the power of divine love, and is thus most dear to God and considered by him to be the highest of all.\n\n#### The Significance of the Word Bhajate\n\nShree Krishna uses the word \"bhajate\", which comes from the root word \"bhaj\", meaning \"to serve\". It is a far more significant word for devotion than \"worship\", which means \"to adore\".\n\n#### Understanding Devotion\n\nHere, Shree Krishna is talking about those who, not merely adore him, but also serve him with loving devotion. They are thus established in the natural position of the soul as the servant of God, while other kinds of yogis are still incomplete in their realization.\n\nThey have connected themselves with God, but they have not yet situated themselves in the understanding that they are his eternal servants.\n\n#### Rarity of Devoted Souls\n\nAnother way of understanding this verse is that bhakti yog provides the closest and most complete realization of God. This is explained in verse 18.55, where Shree Krishna explains that the bhakti yogi alone understands the true personality of God.\n\n#### A Rare Devoted Soul\n\nEven amongst many millions of perfected and liberated saints, the peaceful person who is devoted to the Supreme Lord, Narayan, is very rare.\n\n> \"Amongst many millions of perfected and liberated saints, the peaceful person who is devoted to the Supreme Lord, Narayan, is very rare.\"\n\n— Bhāgavatam 6.14.5\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the bhakti yogi is considered to be the highest form of yoga due to their deep devotion and connection with God. This realization is not only complete but also the closest understanding of the true personality of God."

In contrast, vijñāna (wisdom) is the knowledge gained through spiritual practice, it is a direct experiential realization; and should not be misunderstood for intellectual knowledge.\n\n**A Practical Analogy**\n------------------------\n\nAn example to explain this is honey kept in a sealed jar. We have heard that honey has the sweetest taste that is incomparable to any other sweet. But unless we open the jar and taste it, we will not get the experiential realization of its sweetness.\n\nLikewise, the Guru gives us jñāna, which is the theoretical knowledge of the scriptures. Yet, we need to practice sadhana as per the acquired jñāna, which would consequently purify our mind. Only then, vijñāna (wisdom) knowledge, through self-realization will be attained.\n\n**The Role of Bhakti in Attaining Vijñāna**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOnce Sage Ved Vyas intended to write the Shreemad Bhagavatam: a scripture that would describe God, His glories, nature, and as the object of devotion. But he did not wish to write it only based upon his jñāna.\n\nTherefore, first he engaged himself in bhakti to attain the experiential realization, which is vijñāna. He wrote:\n\n**\"Through Bhakti-Yoga\"**\n---------------------\n\nbhakti-yogena manasi samyak praṇihite ’male\napaśhyat puruṣhaṁ pūrvaṁ māyāṁ cha tad-apāśhrayām\n(Bhagavatam 1.7.4)\n\n\"Through bhakti-yog, Ved Vyas fixed his mind upon God without any material sentiments, and thus attained the complete vision and realization of the Supreme Divine Personality along with His external energy, Maya, which was under His control.\"\n\n**Inspirations from Ved Vyas**\n-----------------------------\n\nInspired by this realization, he wrote the epic scripture.\n\n**The Gift of Knowledge to Arjun**\n---------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Lord Shree Krishna affirms to Arjun that He will bestow upon him the theoretical knowledge regarding the Supreme Divine Personality. He will also illuminate his mind with the required wisdom. Once this knowledge is acquired, there will be nothing remaining for him to know.\n\n**A Promise of Guidance**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Lord's promise to Arjun is a testament to the power of devotion and self-realization.

According to the Sanskrit dictionary, some of its interpretations include:\n\n*   Attainment of supernatural power\n*   Accomplishment\n*   Success\n*   Performance\n*   Fulfillment\n*   Solution of a problem\n*   Completion of cooking or a task\n*   Healing\n*   Hitting the mark\n*   Maturing\n*   Supreme felicity\n*   Beatitude\n*   An unusual skill or faculty\n*   Perfection\n\n### Application in the Bhagavad Gita\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna has used `siddhi` for perfection in the spiritual path. He says, “Only a tiny portion of the innumerable souls are fortunate to get a human birth. Amongst them, only a minuscule strive for spiritual perfection. And even among those perfected souls, ones who are aware of My divine glories and paramount position are very rare.”\n\n### The Limitations of Knowledge without Devotion\n\nHow is it that even perfected souls are unable to know God? The reason is without bhakti or loving devotion, it is not possible to realize the Supreme. Spiritual aspirants of `karm`, `jñāna`, and `haṭha yog` etc., cannot know God unless they include devotion in their practice.\n\n### The Importance of Devotion\n\nShree Krishna has stated this fact several times in the Bhagavad Gita:\n\n*   “The Supreme Divine Personality is greater than all that exists. Although He is all-pervading and all living beings are situated in Him, yet He can be known only through devotion.” 8.22.\n*   “O Arjun, by unalloyed devotion alone can I be known as I am, standing before you. Thereby, on receiving my divine vision, O scorcher of foes, one can enter into union with me.” 11.54\n*   “Only by loving devotion to me does one come to know who I am in truth. Then, having come to know me, my devotee enters into full consciousness of me.” 18.55\n\n### The Role of Devotion in Spiritual Growth\n\nTherefore, such spiritual aspirants who do not include devotion in their sadhana attain only limited theoretical knowledge or `jñāna`. And devoid of `vijñāna` the experiential knowledge, they are unable to know God or the Absolute Truth.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nShree Krishna has stated in this verse that only one among numerous humans knows Him in Truth. In the next verse, He moves on to describe the material and spiritual dimensions of His energies."

    "explanation": "**The Material World: A Complex and Fathomless Energy**\n\n### 7.4 The Energy that Composes this Material World\n\nThe energy that composes this material world is incredibly complex and fathomless. To make it comprehensible to our finite intellect, we have classified it into various categories and sub-categories.\n\n*   Modern science propagates matter to be a combination of elements, and the 118 elements discovered so far, are sectioned under the Periodic Table.\n*   However, the Vedic philosophy and the Bhagavad Gita present a profoundly different classification of the material world. Matter is considered as part of God’s energy and called *prakṛiti*.\n\n### Classification of the Material World\n\nIt is further divided into eight forms, as listed in this verse.\n\n*   It is amazing how insightful the knowledge in these ancient scriptures is in comparison to the developing trends in modern science.\n\n### The Concept of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n\nAlbert Einstein was the first to propound the concept of Mass-Energy Equivalence in 1905. In his Annus Mirabilis papers, he stated that it is possible to convert mass into energy and numerically presented it by an equation E=mc2. His Theory of Relativity replaced an earlier concept of the universe made of solid matter.\n\n*   Both these theories were challenged in 1920 by Niels Bohr and other scientists with Quantum Theory, which proposes a dual particle-wave nature of matter.\n\n### The Quest for a Unified Field Theory\n\nEver since, the scientific community has been on the lookout for a single field or Unified Field Theory, which could expound on the relationship between matter and all forces of the universe.\n\n*   More than 5000 years ago, long before the development of modern science, Lord Krishna had disclosed the perfect Unified Field Theory.\n\n### The Taittirīya Upaniṣad\n\nHe said to Arjun, “All that exists in the universe has manifested from My material energy.” Just one material energy has extended itself into myriad shapes, forms, and entities of this world.\n\n*   The Taittirīya Upaniṣhad has elaborated on this:\n\n“From My material energy the *ākāśhaḥ* (ether) was created, from ether the air; from air, fire; from fire, water; from water, earth; from earth, plants; from plants, food and from food, man. This man is made of food-essence.”\n\n### The Material Energy\n\nThe material energy in its primordial form is called *prakṛiti*. God glances at it when He wishes to create the world. His glance agitates and creates *mahān*. (There is no equivalent word for it in English, as modern science is yet to discover such a subtle level of energy)\n\n*   Mahān further manifests into *ahankār*. (There is no equivalent word for it in English, as modern science is yet to discover such a subtle level of energy)\n\n### The Five Perceptions\n\n*   Ahankār, in turn, forms the *pañch-tanmātrās* or the five perceptions of – taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound.\n\n### The Five Gross Elements\n\nAnd from these, the five gross elements— space, air, fire, water, and earth manifest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLord Shree Krishna includes the mind, intellect, and ego along with the five gross elements as different manifestations of His material energy. In this verse, He states that all these eight elements are simply parts of *Maya*, His material energy.\n\n*   In the next verse, He describes another of His superior energy; the soul energy."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Non-Dualistic Concept**\n=====================================================\n\n7.5 Shree Krishna explains that beyond the eight-fold prakṛiti, the material energy, which He says is inferior; there exists another that is far more superior. This energy is completely transcendental as compared to the lifeless matter. It is His spiritual energy, the jīva śhakti, which includes all the living souls of the world. Now, He has moved from explaining material science toward the spiritual realm.\n\n**Philosophical Perspectives**\n-----------------------------\n\nMany great philosophers of India have given their perspectives and described the relationship between God and the jīva, the individual soul. For example, the non-dualists state:\n\n### \"The Soul Itself is God\"\n\njīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ\n\nThis concept gives rise to several questions, such as:\n\n* How can the soul itself be God? God is most powerful, and Maya is His subservient energy. The souls are always overpowered by Maya.\n* Then is Maya stronger than God?\n* The individual soul is always gripped by ignorance and misery. It needs a continuous reminder from the saints and scriptures, even about its existence and purpose.\n* How can God, who is all-knowing, be considered a soul which is subject to ignorance?\n\n**Duality and Non-Duality**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Vedas repeatedly state that God is all-pervading in this world and beyond. Similarly, individual souls should also be able to exist anywhere at any given time. Then what about the question of going to heaven or hell after death?\n\nThe dualist philosophers' state that the souls and God are separate. Even though it may answer some of the above questions, yet it is still an incomplete philosophy in light of what Shree Krishna states in this verse. He says that the soul is a part of jīva śhakti, God's spiritual energy.\n\n**Vedic Verses on the Non-Dualistic Concept**\n------------------------------------------\n\n### \"Just as the Sun\"\n\neka-deśha-sthitasyāgnir jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā\nparasya brahmaṇaḥ śhaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat\n(Viṣhṇu Purāṇ 1.22.53)\n\nJust as the sun resides in one place but its sunlight pervades; the entire solar system. Similarly, there is one God, who by His infinite powers pervades the three worlds.\n\n### \"The Soul and Maya\"\n\njīva-tattva śhakti, kṛiṣṇa-tattva śhaktimān\ngītā-viṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa\n(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela, 7.117)\n\n\"The soul is the energy of God, while He is the Supreme Energetic.\"\n\n### \"The Non-Dualistic Concept\"\n\nOnce we understand and accept that the soul is a small part of God's infinite energy, the concept of non-duality of the entire creation becomes clear. Energies can exist concurrently within the same energetic.\n\n### \"The Energetic and His Energies\"\n\nJagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has encapsulated and perfectly expressed Shree Krishna's statement in this and the previous verse:\n\njīvu' 'āyā', dui śhakti haiñ, śhaktimān bhagavān\nśhaktihiñ bheda abheda bhī, śhaktimān te jān\n(Bhakti Śhatak verse 42)\n\n\"The soul and Maya are both energies of God. Hence, they are both one with God and also different from God.\"\n\n**The Unity of the Energetic and His Energies**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nConsidering the unison of both; the energetic and His energies, it is stated that God and His creation are non-dual.\n\n### \"All is Brahman\"\n\nsarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma\n(Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 3.14.1)\n\n### \"Everything that Exists is God\"\n\nīśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ\n(Īśhopaniṣhad 1)\n\n### \"The Supreme Divine Personality is Everything\"\n\npuruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ\n(Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 3.15)\n\n**The Existence of Three Entities in Creation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to these Vedic verses, there is only one God and nothing else. Yet, when we consider the energetic and energy concept, there is diversity within this unity and an incredible variety.\n\n### \"Three Entities in Existence\"\n\nkṣharaṁ pradhānamamṛitākṣharaṁ haraḥ\nkṣharātmānāvīśhate deva ekaḥ\ntasyābhidhyānād yojanāt tattvabhāvad\nbhūyaśhchānte viśhwamāyānivṛittiḥ\n(Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 1.10)\n\n\"There are three entities in existence: 1) Matter, which is perishable; 2) The individual souls who are imperishable; 3) God, who is the controller of both matter and the souls.\"\n\n### \"The Concept of Concurrent Coherence\"\n\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has upheld the concepts of concurrent coherence, yet variance between the soul and God. This means God and the soul are one; yet, separate from each other.\n\n**The Non-Dualistic Philosophy**\n----------------------------------\n\nThe Vedas have expounded on both dualistic and non-dualistic concepts. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has upheld the concepts of concurrent coherence, yet variance between the soul and God. This means God and the soul are one; yet, separate from each other."

    "explanation": "**The Two Energies of God**\n\nLiving beings are a manifestation of God's two energies, jīva śhakti, the sentient soul energy, and Maya, the insentient material energy or matter. In the material realm, all life is a combination of both matter and soul. Matter by itself is insentient or lifeless, and the sentient soul needs a carrier body. Hence, both come together to form a living being.\n\n**The Cycle of Creation**\n\nSimilarly, the entire creation is a manifestation of God's energies. One cycle of creation lasts for 100 years of Brahma. Then the Supreme Lord starts the process of dissolution. The five gross elements merge into five subtle elements, which in turn merge into ahankār.\n\n**The Journey of Matter**\n\nAhankār goes back into mahān, which again unites with prakṛiti. Prakṛiti now resides inside the body of Maha Vishnu (another form of the Supreme Lord). All the materially bound souls, which could not get liberated during this cycle of creation, also reside in God's body. They remain unmanifested, waiting for the next cycle of creation.\n\n**The Nature of God**\n\nWhen God decides to create, the entire cycle begins all over again (as explained in verse 7.4), and a new world comes into existence. Therefore, God is the source, the sustainer, and the resting place for the entire creation.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Living beings are a manifestation of God's two energies: jīva śhakti and Maya.\n* The material realm is a combination of matter and soul.\n* Matter needs a carrier body to form a living being.\n* The entire creation is a manifestation of God's energies.\n* One cycle of creation lasts for 100 years of Brahma.\n* The process of dissolution is initiated by the Supreme Lord."

Now, He continues to explain it further in these four verses.\n\nThe sweet taste of any fruit that we eat confirms the presence of Fructose or fruit sugar in it. Similarly, Shree Krishna reveals that He is present in all the modifications of His energies. He says He is the taste in water.\n\n**What Does it Mean to be the Taste of Water?**\n\nWater hardly has any taste of its own. Yet, other forms of matter such as solids, fires, and gases need liquids to carry their taste. We can illustrate this by trying to put a solid food item on our dry tongue. Do we get any taste? Only when the saliva in our mouth dissolves some part of the solid, we start getting the taste as perceived by the taste buds on our tongue.\n\n**The Intrinsic Property of Water**\n\nThat is why Shree Krishna says that he is the taste in water. It is the intrinsic property of water to carry the taste of all substances; without water, there will be no taste.\n\n### The Role of Space in Sound\n\nIn the same way,\n\nākāśha\nacts as the vehicle for sound. Different languages form due to sound modifications.\n\n#### The Origin of Sound and the Universe\n\nShree Krishna says He is the origin of it all, as the sound in space is His energy. He is the syllable \nOm\nthe most important sound in the Vedic mantras.\n\n**The Ultimate Energy Source**\n\nThe sun and the moon get their radiance from Him. Even for all the abilities that manifest in humans, He is the ultimate energy source.\n\n#### Key Takeaways\n\n*   Fructose and water are both essential for our taste buds to function.\n*   The presence of water is necessary to carry the taste of other substances.\n*   Sound in space is an essential aspect of the universe, and it originates from Shree Krishna's energy.\n*   The universe is governed by Shree Krishna's ultimate energy source."

For example, an ocean is the seed of the clouds, and the clouds are the seed for rain. Similarly, Shree Krishna says in this verse that He is the cause (the eternal seed) from which all beings manifest.\n\n### Why Some People Excel?\n\nHave you ever thought about why some people are more intelligent than others? Why do they have greater brilliance in their thoughts and ideas?\n\n#### The Explanation\n\nThe only explanation for this can be; since all that exists is a manifestation of God’s energy. The splendid qualities visible in such outstanding people can only be due to God’s grace.\n\n#### A Quote from Shree Krishna\n\n\"As I am the source of all beings, so are you, my child. I make your mind more analytic and thoughts scintillating.\"\n\n### Legendary Examples\n\nThe legend of modern history, such as William Shakespeare, displayed unmatched brilliance in the field of literature. That could have only been possible by God’s grace.\n\n*   His works have nourished English literature, and English has now become the most used language of the world.\n*   Swami Vivekananda once said: \"The British Empire has united the world in one language.\"\n\n### Another Genius\n\nAnother such genius is Bill Gates, who changed the course of information technology with his Windows Operating System.\n\n*   With more than ninety percent of market share, Windows has become the most popular Operating System in the world.\n*   As it is very user-friendly, it has made information technology available to the public at large.\n*   The usage of computers is not limited to IT engineers anymore.\n\n#### God's Plan\n\nSuch inspiration to have one major operating system to unify the information technology industry and ensure proper interaction could only be through God’s plan.\n\n*   God enhances one such person’s intellect when he wants to save us from chaos.\n\n### Saintly Acknowledgement\n\nThe saints have always acknowledged that the brilliance and beauty of their works are due to God’s special grace.\n\n*   Sage Tulsidas said:\n    \n    ```cpp\nna maiñ kiyā na kari sakauñ, sahiba kartā mor\nkarata karāvata āap haiñ, tulasī tulasī śhor\n```\n\n    \"Neither did I write the Ramayan, nor do I have the ability to write it. The Lord is my Doer. He directs my actions and acts through me, but the world thinks that Tulsidas is doing them.\"\n\n    Therefore, Lord Shree Krishna is indeed the ultimate source of all the brilliance and intelligence that manifests around us.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the ultimate source of brilliance and intelligence is not human effort or achievement but God's special grace."

These veil the human consciousness and cause fascination with the bodily pleasures which are short-lived.\n\n### The Nature of Maya\n\nThe word \"Maya\" is made from mā (not) and yā (what is). Thus, Maya means \"that which is not what it appears to be.\"\n\n### The Role of Maya\n\nMaya, being one of God's energy, is engaged in the service of hiding His true nature from the souls who are not yet eligible or God-realized. It lures and confuses the souls who are already vimukh (having their backs turned) from God.\n\n### Maya's Effect on Souls\n\nIt also troubles them with problems and difficulties aided by the three-fold material miseries. By this, Maya makes the souls realize that they can never be happy unless they are sanmukh (their face turned) toward God.\n\n### The Three Modes of Maya\n\n*   **Ignorance**: Maya veils the human consciousness and causes fascination with the bodily pleasures which are short-lived.\n*   **Passion**: Maya troubles souls with problems and difficulties aided by the three-fold material miseries.\n*   **Goodness**: Maya is also a mode of Maya, which causes fascination with the bodily pleasures and troubles souls with problems and difficulties aided by the three-fold material miseries.\n\n### Maya's True Nature\n\nMaya is \"that which is not what it appears to be.\" It is an energy of God, and its true nature is to serve as a veil for His true nature."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Maya: The Material Energy**\n\n### Verse Explanation\n\nSome people claim that Maya is *mithyā* (non-existent). They say that the material energy Maya is a perception created due to our ignorance, but if someone attains spiritual knowledge, Maya will cease to exist. The soul itself is the Ultimate Reality, and once we understand that, all illusions shall dispel.\n\nHowever, this theory is negated by the Bhagavad Gita in this verse. Shree Krishna has already stated that Maya is an extension of His energy and not an illusion.\n\nThe Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad also states:\n\n```vedic\nmāyāṁ tu prakṛitiṁ vidyānmāyinaṁ tu maheśhvaram\n(4.10)\n```\n\n\"Maya is the energy (prakṛiti), while God is the Energetic.\"\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\n```hindi\nso dāsī raghubīra ki samujheṅ mithyā sopi\n```\n\n\"Some people think Maya is *mithyā* (non-existent), but factually it is an energy engaged in the service of God.\"\n\nShree Krishna has mentioned here that because Maya is His energy, it is difficult to overcome. If someone claims they have defeated Maya, that would mean they have defeated God. No one can conquer God; therefore, Maya is equally invincible.\n\n### The Human Mind and Maya\n\nThe human mind is made of Maya merely by self-effort. No yogi, jñānī, ascetic, or karmī can successfully control the mind.\n\n### Overcoming Maya\n\nOne could then ask, \"Is it impossible to overcome Maya?\" The second line of this verse has the answer to this question. Shree Krishna says:\n\n\"Those who surrender themselves to Me, the Supreme Lord, then by My grace, they would smoothly cross the ocean of material existence. I will instruct Maya to leave this soul, now that it has become Mine.\"\n\nOn God's instructions, Maya, the material energy of God, simply releases the surrendered soul from its clutches.\n\nIt says, \"My job is to keep troubling the soul until it surrenders at the feet of God; once the soul reaches there, my job is complete.\"\n\n### An Everyday Analogy\n\nAn example from everyday life can help illustrate this concept. Assume that you visit a friend who has a large house, outside on the gate, a board says, \"Beware of dog.\" When you look inside, a trained guard dog is standing on the lawn. As soon as it spots you, it starts growling menacingly, scared; you decide to take the back gate. But even before you reach the back of the house, it is waiting there for you and snarls furiously, as if saying, \"You dare step into this house.\"\n\nYou have no choice, and you shout your friend's name aloud. Hearing all the commotion, your friend comes and finds you at the gate troubled by his dog. He sternly says to the dog, \"No, Tommy, that is a friend, we need to let him in, come and sit down here.\" Hearing his master's command, the dog silently goes and sits near him. You can now open the gate and let yourself in without fear.\n\nIn the same way, we are in the clutches of Maya, the material energy. Although it is subservient to God, it keeps troubling us so that we keep moving towards God. By our own efforts, we cannot defeat Maya; only when we surrender completely to God, by His grace, we can cross the ocean of material existence.\n\n### Questions and Answers\n\nThe next question in our mind would be, \"If it is so easy to defeat Maya, then why is it that most of us fail?\" Shree Krishna has elaborated on that in the next verse."

They have never heard about these concepts or are aware of the process of surrendering to God.\n\n### 2. The Lazy\n\nThese are the ones who have the knowledge and awareness of what they need to do still, due to their lazy-nature do not want to take any initiative to surrender. Laziness can be a big pitfall for someone on the path of spirituality.\n\n**A Sanskrit Saying**\n\nālasya hī manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥ\nnāstyudyamasamo bandhuḥ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati\n\n\"Laziness is a big enemy, and it resides; in our body itself. Work is a good friend of humans, which never leads to downfall.\"\n\n### 3. Deluded Intellects\n\nPeople who are so proud of their intellects that they have no faith in the scriptures and the teachings of the saints. Because they do not have faith, they are unable to practice surrender or understand the concepts of God-realization.\n\n### 4. Demonic Nature\n\nThese are the people who are aware of God and His purpose for the world but still work against Him. It is because of their demonic nature; they do not like God and His glories. They themselves are far from devotion and try to disturb others who are on the path of spirituality.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSurrender to God is not expected from these four categories.

The Distressed\n\nThose who find that their pot of worldly miseries is overflowing, and they are unable to cope with them conclude that it is futile running after the world. Thus, decide to take shelter in God.\n\n**Example from Mahabharata**\n\nAn apt example in the Mahabharata was Draupadi's surrender to Shree Krishna when Duryodhan and Dushasan tried to dishonor her in the courtroom of Hastinapur.\n\n* Initially, she expected her husbands would protect her, but they did not.\n* She pleaded the elders in the courtroom, Bheeshma, Vidur, Dhritarashtra, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc.\n* However, everyone remained speechless.\n* When cruel Dushasan tried to disrobe her, she clenched her sari with her teeth and tried to protect her honor with her own strength.\n* But her teeth could not hold on to the sari for long; they gave in to Dushasan's strength.\n* She was helpless and finally called out to Shree Krishna for help.\n\n**The Power of Surrender**\n\nIt was at this point that she surrendered completely to God and was not relying on anyone or her own strength for protection. Shree Krishna reciprocated immediately and intervened.\n\n* Now, however much Dushasan pulled, Draupadi's sari kept extending, and very soon, there was a huge pile of cloth in the middle of the courtroom.\n* Dushasan was unable to disrobe Draupadi; exhausted, he gave up.\n* Such was the power of God's protection, but it came only when Draupadi surrendered completely.\n\n### 2. The Knowledge Seekers\n\nThere are some people who have heard about the opulence of God and His spiritual realm. Thus, they are curious to know all about God and try to seek Him through knowledge.\n\n### 3. The Seekers of Worldly Possessions\n\nSome people are clear about what they want and take the shelter of God because they are convinced that only God can provide what they are seeking.\n\n**Example from Mahabharata**\n\nKing Dhruv is an apt example. When Dhruv was a small boy, he felt neglected by his father, King Uttanapada. Disheartened, he went into the forest and did penance to please God.\n\n* He wanted to become more powerful than his father.\n* But as his devotion grew, he realized that God possessed the priceless jewel of divine love, and what he was seeking was like broken pieces of glass.\n* Therefore, when pleased with his devotion, God gave him darshan, and he requested the Lord to bestow upon him self-less pure love.\n\n### 4. Those Situated in Knowledge\n\nLastly, those souls who have understood the truth that they are tiny parts of God. Such people engage in devotion with the intent that it is their eternal duty to love and serve Him.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Description**\n\nShree Krishna calls them the fourth kind of devotees."

    "explanation": "**The Significance of Selfless Devotion**\n\nIn the context of Bhakti Yoga, selfless devotion (parabhakti) is a fundamental concept that distinguishes the highest level of devotion from worldly love. According to Shree Krishna, devotees seated in knowledge (jnani bhakt) are the highest due to their selfless worship of God without expecting material gains.\n\n**Characteristics of Selfless Devotion**\n\nSelfless devotion is driven by the desire for God's happiness and sacrifice in His service. It fosters a giving attitude without expecting anything in return, unlike worldly love which is fueled by the desire for self-gratification. This difference is highlighted in two quotes:\n\n*   **Chaitanya Mahaprabhu**: \"Lust (worldly love) exists for self-happiness; divine love is harbored for Shree Krishna's happiness. There is a tremendous difference between them—lust is like darkness and ignorance, while divine love is pure and illuminating.\" (Chaitanya Charitamrit, Adi Leela, 4.166 & 171)\n*   **Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj**: \"Give up the desires for worldly pleasures and that of liberation if you wish to walk the path of devotion. Else the pure waters of divine love will get tainted with selfishness.\" (Bhakti Shatak verse 45)\n*   **Sage Narad**: \"True love is for the happiness of the Beloved.\" (Narada Bhakti Darshan, Sutra 24)\n\n**The Nature of Selfless Devotion**\n\nTrue selfless devotion is characterized by:\n\n*   **No attachment to material gains**: The devotee seeks God's happiness over personal benefits.\n*   **A giving attitude**: Devotion is offered without expecting anything in return, fostering a spirit of generosity.\n*   **The highest quality of God**: Bhakta vatsalata (his love for his devotees) is considered the most elevated aspect of God.\n\n**The Puraṇas' Perspective**\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes the importance of selfless devotion in his teachings:\n\n*   \"I become the slave of those devotees of mine, who chant my names and keep me close to them in their thoughts; this is a fact, O Arjun.\" (Ādi Purāṇ 1.2.231)\n\n**Boundless Devotion**\n\nThe devotion and love of selfless devotees not only uplift themselves but also bind God, who becomes their master in essence. This profound understanding highlights the transformative power of selfless devotion and its capacity to reshape our perception of God and ourselves."

They are disdainful towards people engaged in devotion, looking down upon them and considering themselves superior due to their focus on acquiring knowledge. However, Shree Krishna declares that a _jñānī_ (one who has acquired knowledge) spends several lifetimes cultivating knowledge and only when their knowledge matures does he finally surrender to God. It is true knowledge that leads to devotion.\n\n**An Example to Illustrate the Relationship**\n------------------------------------------\n\nLet us consider an example of a man who was walking on the beach. He steps upon an object on the sand and finds it to be a golden ring. Initially, he thinks of it as artificial jewelry worth $10 and keeps it in his pocket, forgetting about it. After a few days, he remembers the ring and shows it to a friend, who is a goldsmith. The goldsmith checks it and says, \"This is pure gold and worth at least $500.\" The man feels thrilled to have found something precious and wears it every day. A few days pass by, and his uncle visits him, who is a jeweler. The uncle looks at the ring and says, \"The stone on your gold ring is a precious diamond. Where did you get this? It costs more than $50,000.\" On hearing this, the man is overwhelmed and cannot believe what his uncle just said. His uncle understands this and says, \"It seems you don't believe me, I am willing to pay you $40,000 for it.\" Now, the man feels elated as if he has won a lottery.\n\n**The Direct Relationship Between Knowledge and Love**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThis example demonstrates the direct relationship between knowledge and love. When the value of the ring was perceived by the man to be less, his love for it was also lesser. However, as his knowledge of its value increased, the love for it and the joy he got from it also kept increasing.\n\n**The Ramayan: A Upanishadic Perspective**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\n\"Without knowledge, there cannot be faith; without faith, love cannot grow.\"\n\nSimilarly, if someone has acquired true knowledge and claims to know the _Brahman_, then love for Him comes naturally. Else, their knowledge is merely theoretical if they do not feel the love that fosters devotion.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Declaration**\n-----------------------------\n\nShree Krishna says that _jñānīs_ (those who have acquired knowledge) spend several lifetimes seeking true knowledge. When their knowledge matures into true wisdom, they realize that \"God is all that is\" and surrender to Him. However, He does not say this for the _jñānīs_, _karmīs_, _haṭha-yogis_, ascetics, etc. He declares this for the devotees or such exalted souls who have realized \"God is all that is\" and surrendered to Him. Nevertheless, such noble souls are very rare.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, the verse highlights the importance of devotion and knowledge. While intellectual pursuits can lead to a deeper understanding of the world, they do not replace devotion. True knowledge that leads to devotion is essential for a deeper understanding of the Supreme Lord and a more profound surrender."

    "explanation": "**The True Nature of Celestial Gods**\n\nShree Krishna explains that people worship the devatās (celestial gods) as per the prescribed rituals to attain material gains. Unfortunately, these individuals are shrouded in material desires, which obscure their true knowledge. As a result, they forget that the Supreme Lord is the ultimate source of all existence, including these celestial gods.\n\n**The Relationship Between Celestial Gods and God**\n\nJust as a president appoints officers among different departments, the celestial gods occupy various positions within God's creation. They derive their powers from God and are not independent of Him. However, these gods can bestow material benefits on their devotees only to the extent that they are under God's control. They cannot liberate anyone from the cycle of birth and death, as they themselves are bound by this cycle. It is only God who possesses the power to liberate.\n\n**The Impermanence of Celestial Gods**\n\nLike us, the celestial gods are souls. However, they have attained their positions in the celestial abodes due to their pious deeds from previous lives. Once these individuals exhaust their accounts of good deeds, they must return to earth. This means that even the celestial gods are perishable, whereas God alone is eternal.\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Celestial gods derive their powers from God.\n* They are not independent of God and cannot liberate others from the cycle of birth and death.\n* Even celestial gods are perishable, whereas God is eternal."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Devotion to Celestial Gods**\n=====================================================\n\n### A Question from the Devotees\n\nIn verse 7.21, Shree Krishna answers a question from His devotees about how people develop such high faith in the lower form of worship. The verse highlights that Shree Krishna is the creator of faith in both celestial gods and His own form.\n\n#### The Role of Shree Krishna in Faith\n\nShree Krishna explains that He is the one who inspires faith in the hearts of His devotees. When people worship the devatās for material gains, Shree Krishna helps them in their devotion and steadies their faith. The ability to create śhraddhā or faith is beyond the capacity of celestial gods, and it is the indwelling Paramātmā or Supreme Soul who inspires faith.\n\n### True-Knowledge and Faith\n\nIn verse 15.15, Shree Krishna states that He is seated in the hearts of all living beings and inspires faith through various means. He also mentions that He is the author of the Vedanta and the knower of its meaning.\n\n#### The Purpose of Faith in Celestial Gods\n\nShree Krishna had earlier mentioned that those who engage in true-knowledge worship the Supreme Lord. One might wonder why Shree Krishna creates faith in people toward celestial gods, considering it may seem inappropriate.\n\n### A Parable to Understand Faith Development\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nTo better understand the development of faith, let's consider an example. Parents give dolls to their small children, allowing them to play with these dolls as if they were real people. The child develops love and affection toward the dolls, which helps them acquire qualities like love, care, and affection for other people. These qualities will make children socially responsible when they grow up.\n\n### An Analogy to Faith Development\n\nShree Krishna's eternal parent role is similar. When He finds that some souls engage in worship of celestial gods for material gains, He helps them by steadying their faith. Shree Krishna is aware that this experience will help in the evolution of the soul, and once they acquire true-knowledge about the Supreme Lord being the summum bonum or highest good of everything, they will surrender to Him.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n------------------\n\nIn conclusion, Shree Krishna's role in creating faith is to inspire devotion and help His devotees develop qualities that will make them socially responsible. By understanding the development of faith, we can better appreciate Shree Krishna's eternal parent role and the purpose behind His actions."

They can only grant wishes if God permits it.\n\n**Interpretation**\n-----------------\n\nThe word \"Labhate\" means \"to obtain.\" The devotees with mediocre understanding may think that they have obtained their desired material objects by pleasing the devatās (celestial gods).\n\n### Misconception\nHowever, it is not the devatās, but God who facilitates everything.\n\n### Key Point\n#### **God's Role vs. Devatās' Role**\n\nThe celestial gods cannot fulfill the material desires of their devotees on their own. They can only grant wishes if God permits it.\n\n### Practical Implication\n-----------------------\n\nThis understanding encourages devotees to focus on pleasing and serving God, rather than just trying to please the devatās. By doing so, they will be able to obtain their desired material objects in the end."

People who worship the \ndevatās\n go to the planets of the respective \ndevatās\n upon death.\n Whereas, those who are devoted to me come to my abode.\"\n \n### The Question of Faith and Devotion\n\nNow, the question comes up again, when reaching God is the ultimate destination, then why does God steady the faith of those devotees who worship the celestial gods?\n\n### An Analogy from Education\n\nConsider the example of our education system, where students start with primary school but cannot stay at that level forever. The teachers encourage them and coach them to move to the next level. Even though primary school is necessary, students outgrow that and keep moving higher and higher.\n\nSimilarly, the Bhagavad Gita is not for the primary school students or the novices who wish to attain the celestial abodes. But for those devotees who are seeking a higher purpose.\n\n### The Impermanence of Celestial Gods\n\nThe \ndevatās\n are perishable, and the fruits they bestow on their devotees are also perishable.\n\n### The Impermanence of Celestial Gods (continued)\n\nHowever, God is imperishable, and the fruits of his worship are also ever-lasting.\n\n### Attaining Eternal Abode\n\nThose who worship the eternal form of God, upon death, attain His eternal abode and stay there forever in His service."

    "explanation": "**Debate on Supreme Lord's Form**\n\nPeople often vehemently debate upon the Supreme Lord being a formless God, while the others claim He exists in His personal-form. Even those who agree to both aspects of God’s personality are sometimes confused. Which of them precedes the other, and which of them is the original God? Did the personal form of God manifest from the formless, or is it the other way round?\n\n**Resolving the Debate**\n\nShree Krishna resolves this debate by stating that God exists in the spiritual realm eternally in His divine form. The ignorant do not understand the magnificent and imperishable nature of His personal-form.\n\n**Key Points Regarding Divine Forms**\n\n### The Divine Personality is Primordial\n\nThe divine personality of God has not manifested from the formless Brahman; it is primordial. The divine light that emanates from His transcendental body is the formless Brahman.\n\n### Padma Purāṇ Stating the Same\n\nThe Padma Purāṇ states:\nyannakhenduruchir brahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥ\nguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram\n(Patal Khand 77.60) [v21]\n“The light that emanates from the toenails of God’s personality is worshipped as \nthe Brahman\nby the jñānīs.”\n\n### Conclusion on Divine Forms\n\nTherefore, there is no difference between the two forms. Neither of them is superior or inferior.\n\n**Understanding Divine Forms**\n\nIn God’s personal-form, His name, form, virtues, abode, pastimes, associates, etc., manifest as an extension of His divine energy. However, in the formless Brahman,\neven though all the divine potencies and energies exist, they are in a concealed form."

    "explanation": "**The Divine Energies of Shree Krishna**\n==========================================\n\nShree Krishna had mentioned two of His divine energies earlier in this chapter, in verses 7.4 and 7.5. The eight-fold prakṛiti, or the material energy, and the jīva śhakti, or the soul energy. Now, He talks about His third and the most powerful energy that is the Yogmaya.\n\n**The Three Divine Energies of Shree Krishna**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the Viṣhṇu Purāṇ:\n\n\"The Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu has three main energies—\nYogmaya, the souls, and Maya.\"\n\n- Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:\n\n\"The Supreme Energetic Shree Krishna has infinite energies. Amongst these, Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya are the main ones.\"\n\n**The Role of Yogmaya Energy**\n---------------------------\n\nGod descends in this world by virtue of His Yog Maya energy and reveals His divine pastimes, His divine abode, His divine bliss and love on the Earth plane. However, the same Yog Maya power keeps His divinity veiled from us. We are unable to feel His presence, although He is seated in our hearts.\n\n**Concealing and Revealing God**\n-----------------------------\n\nEven in the present, if we are fortunate enough to see the Lord in His personal-form, we cannot recognize Him. Until we are eligible for His divine vision, the Yog Maya keeps God's divine form concealed from us. And only by God's grace, the Yog Maya bestows upon us the divine vision that allows us to recognize and see God.\n\n**Purifying the Heart**\n--------------------\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\n\"O God, you have a divine form. Only those whose hearts are purified can know you by your grace.\"\n\n**The Manifestation of Yog Maya**\n---------------------------------\n\nSimilar to God, His Yog Maya energy is both formless and manifests into personal forms. Radha, Sita, Lakshmi, Parvati. Durga, Kali, etc., are the divine forms of the Yog Maya energy of God.\n\n**Motherly Qualities of Yog Maya**\n----------------------------------\n\nIn the Vedic culture, all these forms are revered; as the Mother of the Universe. She radiates the motherly qualities of kindness, mercy, compassion, beauty, divine grace, and causeless love.\n\n**Acquiring Transcendental Knowledge**\n--------------------------------------\n\nAmong these, the most important quality for us souls is Her divine grace with which we can acquire transcendental knowledge to know God. It is for the same reason, the devotees of Vrindavan sing:\n\n\"Radhe Radhe, Shyam se milā de,\"\n\n\"O Radha, please bestow your grace and help me meet Shree Krishna.\"\n\n**The Dual Nature of Yog Maya**\n---------------------------------\n\nTherefore, the same Yog Maya – conceals God from the unqualified souls and bestows Her divine grace upon the surrendered souls, for they can know Him. However, those souls who are under the influence of Maya or the material energy turn their backs towards God. They remain bereft of the divine grace of His Yog Maya energy and continue living in ignorance, entangled in Maya.\n\n**The Liberated Souls**\n-------------------------\n\nOthers who have turned to God are in the shelter of Yog Maya and liberated from Maya."

Most of us are forgetful of even what we were thinking a few hours ago; whereas, God is omniscient. He remembers and keeps a record of the deeds, words, and even the thoughts of each individual soul of the universe throughout their life and since their infinite lifetimes.\n\n### Maintenance of Sañchit Karma\n\nGod maintains this record of the `sañchit karma` or the stockpile of karmas of every soul for endless lifetimes because, as the governor of the law of karma, He dispenses justice to the souls.\n\n### The Limitation of Human Knowledge\n\nShree Krishna says that He has the knowledge of everything, the past, present, and the future. However, with our finite intellect, we cannot know the Almighty God. His infinite glory, splendor, energies, qualities, and extent are beyond the comprehension of our inadequate intellect.\n\n### The Vedic Scriptures on Omnipotence\n\nThe Vedic scriptures state:\n\n#### \"God is all-knowing and omniscient. His austerity consists of knowledge.\"\n\n`yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavidyasya jñānamayaṁ tapaḥ`  \n(Muṇḍakopaniṣhad 1.1.9) [v25]\n\"God is all-knowing and omniscient. His austerity consists of knowledge.\"\n\n#### \"God is beyond the scope of our intellectual logic.\"\n\n`naiṣhā tarkeṇa matirāpaneyā`  \n(Kaṭhopaniṣhad 1.2.9) [v26]\n\"God is beyond the scope of our intellectual logic.\"\n\n#### \"God cannot be described in words, nor can our mind comprehend Him.\"\n\n`yato vācho nivartante aprāpya manasā saha`  \n(Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 2.9.1) [v27]\n\"God cannot be described in words, nor can our mind comprehend Him.\"\n\n#### \"God cannot be analyzed by arguments or formulated by words, mind, and intellect.\"\n\n`rām atarkya buddhi mana bānī, mata hamāra asa sunahi sayānī`  \n(Ramayan) [v28]\n\"God cannot be analyzed by arguments or formulated by words, mind, and intellect.\"\n\n### The Nature of God's Knowledge\n\nOnly God knows Himself. However, if He finds some eligible soul, He bestows His grace upon that fortunate soul, and then with God’s divine intellect, the soul gets to know God. Therefore, only by God’s grace one can know God. Our material intellect does not have the capacity to know Him otherwise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe concept of God's grace is discussed again in detail in 10.11 and 18.56."

Happiness and distress, pleasure and pain, summer and winter, night and day, etc., all these dualities exist in pairs. These dualities are an inseparable part of life’s experiences.\n\n### The Illusion of Birth and Death\n\nHowever, the most deluding dualities in life are birth and death. The arena of one’s life exists between the two ends of birth and death. From the very moment a living creature is born, death is inevitable, and again comes a subsequent-birth.\n\n### The Material Intellect's Perception\n\nOur material intellect believes that worldly pleasures will give us happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, in material consciousness, while we desire the favorable ones, we detest the unpleasant experiences.\n\n### The Roots of Delusion\n\nHowever, attraction and aversion are not the inherent qualities of these dualities, they develop due to our ignorance. Our intellect does not realize that materially pleasurable situations will only increase our material illusion. Thus, it makes us believe that pain is detrimental to us.\n\n### The Reality of Adversity\n\nHowever, adversities have the potential of dispelling that material illusion from our mind and elevate our soul. Our ignorance is the root cause of our delusions.\n\n### The Path to Liberation\n\nA spiritually elevated person accepts these dualities as inseparable aspects of God’s creation and rises above likes and dislikes, attraction and aversion, etc."

However, the Brahman is beyond these, as He is transcendental to the material plane.\n\n### Characteristics of the Brahman\n\nHe is described as *aksharam* or indestructible because He is unaffected by the changes in the universe.\n\n**Quotes from Ancient Texts**\n\n* \"Learned people speak of Brahman as *akshar* (indestructible).\" - Brihadaranyak Upanishad 3.8.8\n* \"It is also designated as *Param* (Supreme) because It possesses qualities beyond those possessed by maya and the souls.\"\n\n### The Concept of Adhyatma\n\nThe word *adhyatma* has two meanings in Sanskrit.

Therefore, it is natural that these would continue to determine our final thoughts.\n\n**The Story of King Bharat**\n==========================\n\nThe Puranas tell a story of an illustrious King Bharat. He renounced his kingdom to pursue God-realization and was living an ascetics life in the forest. Once, he was meditating and saw a deer jump into a nearby river. She was pregnant and escaping an attacking tiger. Out of fear, she delivered the baby in the flowing water. She had no chance to rescue her new-born and crossed over to the other side of the river.\n\n**King Bharat's Experience**\n-------------------------\n\nWitnessing this entire episode, Bharat felt pity for the baby deer that was floating in the river. He rescued the fawn and took it to his hut. He started raising it with great affection. Collecting green grass and feeding it, keeping it warm by hugging it, and watching its frolicking, gave Bharat a lot of pleasure.\n\n**The Consequence of King Bharat's Thoughts**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nSlowly, Bharat spent his entire day taking care of the fawn. His mind became totally absorbed in its thoughts and away from God. Thus, even when he was about to die, he was only concerned about the fawn and called out to it in fond remembrance. As a result, King Bharat was born as a deer in his next life.\n\n**King Bharat's Spiritual Journey**\n---------------------------------\n\nNevertheless, because of his spiritual sadhana from his previous lives, even in a deer’s body, he was aware of the mistakes he had committed in his past life. Hence even as a deer, Bharat spent his entire life near pious ashrams of saints in the forest. And when he died, he was granted human birth again.\n\n**The Second Chance**\n--------------------\n\nThis time, Bharat did not waste his chance and completed his sadhana. Eventually, he attained God-realization and came to be known as the great sage Jadabharat.\n\n**The Pain of Death**\n-------------------\n\nDeath is a very painful experience. Therefore, it is natural that the mind gravitates toward those thoughts that are part of one’s inherent nature.\n\n**The Difficulty of Thinking of God at Death**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the Skand Puran, thinking of God at the moment of death is exceedingly difficult. Hence, for the mind to always think of God requires our inner nature to be one with Him.\n\n**The Importance of Practicing Remembering God**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe consciousness that abides within our mind and intellect is our inner nature. And whatever thoughts we contemplate continuously manifest as part of our inner nature. Therefore, we must practice remembering God at every moment of our life.\n\n**The Consequence of Practicing Remembering God**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOnly then will we develop a God-conscious inner nature. In the next verse, Lord Krishna advises the same to Arjun."

    "explanation": "**The Essence of Karma Yoga**\n=====================================\n\n### Introduction to Karma Yoga\n\nThe essence of the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita is in the first line of this verse. It has the power to make your life divine. It reiterates the definition of karma yoga and applies to people from all walks of life.\n\n### Defining Karma Yoga\n\nShree Krishna says to Arjun, “Do your duty with your body, and keep your mind attached to Me.” As a warrior, Arjun must fight; that is his duty. However, the Lord says to Arjun that even in the middle of a battle, one should remember God. The same message is for everyone—be it farmers, engineers, doctors, students, homemakers, or any other professional.\n\n**Myths about Karma Yoga**\n----------------------------\n\nPeople often disregard their worldly duties and responsibilities with the pretext of leading a spiritual life. On the other hand, some give an excuse of their worldly engagements for not practicing spirituality. They perceive that both material and spiritual goals cannot be pursued concurrently. But Shree Krishna’s message in this verse defies all these myths and can sanctify our entire life.\n\n### The Practice of Karma Yoga\n\nIn the practice of karma yoga, the body is engaged in worldly work, but the mind is attached to God. Hence, while we work to fulfill our worldly duties, these works are not bound by the Law of Karma. Works that are performed with attachment result in karmic reactions. In the absence of attachment, one is not considered guilty even in the worldly laws.\n\n**Example: The Man Accused of Killing a Pedestrian**\n\nLet us take an example of a man apprehended for killing a pedestrian in a road accident. In the court, when the judge questioned him if he killed the pedestrian, the man agreed. The judge said, “Then you are guilty of murder and will get punished accordingly.” To this, the man said, “Sir, I agree I killed the pedestrian, but I had no intention to kill, it was an accident.” He further explained, “Your honour, I was driving on the appropriate side of the road, the lights were green, and my car was within the speed limits. I was alert, and my car was also in perfect condition. However, this man came suddenly in front of my car, although I applied the brakes, my car hit him, and he died immediately.”\n\nOn hearing this, the judge let him off without any punishment, as it was established that the incident was an accident and this man had no intention to kill. The above example illustrates that even in the material world, one is not held liable for actions taken without attachment to results. Similarly, in the spiritual world, the Law of Karma holds the same principle.\n\n### Arjun's Performance of Dharma\n\nIn the Mahabharat war, Arjun fulfilled his duties as a warrior. He fought valiantly without any attachments to worldly gain. He followed Shree Krishna’s instructions and kept his mind constantly attached to God. Therefore, at the end of the war, Shree Krishna declared that Arjun had not accrued any bad karma. As per the Law of Karma: when someone performs their duties without any selfish attachment to the world, with their mind always in God, such actions get multiplied by zero. When you multiply even a million with zero, the result will always be a zero.\n\n### The Condition for Karma Yoga\n\nThis verse clearly defines the condition for karma yoga: Do your worldly duties, but your mind should always be thinking of God. The very instant we forget God, our mind is taken over by the mighty commanders of maya’s army—desire, envy, greed, lust, anger, hatred, etc. Therefore, it is necessary that we keep our mind always attached to God.\n\n### Misunderstandings about Karma Yoga\n\nSome people claim to be karma yogis because they practice both karma and yoga. Every day they do their worldly duties, which they call their karma, and a few minutes of yoga by meditating on God. However, this is not the definition of karma yoga given by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. He says that in karma yoga, there are only two conditions:\n\n1. While doing any work, the mind should always be thinking of God.\n2. The remembrance of God should be constant throughout the day and not intermittent.\n\n### Saint Kabir's Wisdom\n\nThis famous couplet by Saint Kabir beautifully expresses this concept:\n\nsumiran kī sudhi yoṅ karo, jyauṅ gāgar panihāra\nbolat dolat surati meṅ, kahe kabīra vichār\n\n“Remember God just as the village woman remembers the water pot on her head. She speaks with others and walks on the path, but her hand keeps holding onto the pot.”\n\n### The Benefits of Practicing Karma Yoga\n\nIn the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the benefits of practicing karma yoga.\n\nThe practice of karma yoga can sanctify our entire life. It helps us to fulfill our worldly duties without attachment to results, and it keeps our mind constantly attached to God. By following the principles of karma yoga, we can avoid the negative effects of worldly activities and achieve spiritual growth."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Meditating on God**\n\nLord Krishna has reiterated this instruction to always engage the mind in meditating upon God several times in the Bhagavad Gita itself. Verses 8.14, 10.10, 12.8, etc., emphasize the same concept.\n\n**Understanding the Word \"Abhyāsa\"**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna uses the word *abhyāsa*, which means to practice. He says that we must train our mind and form a habit of always meditating upon God. This practice is not to be done at fixed times or regular intervals but continuously as part of our daily life alongside our worldly activities throughout the day.\n\n**The Key to Personal Growth**\n\nWe must remember that it is not the actions that we are performing with our body but where we are placing our mind that will shape our future. While performing our worldly duties, if we attach our mind to God, who is all pure, our mind will also get purified.\n\n**The Consequences of Devotion**\n\nWhen one is continuously engaging in devotion, with complete surrender to God, their purified mind will gradually get fully absorbed in God-consciousness. Such souls receive the divine grace of God that liberates them from the bondage of maya.\n\n**The Rewards of Devotion**\n\nThen God bestows upon these souls His unlimited divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. They become God-realized while they are still alive and live a complete life.\n\n**The Ultimate Goal**\n\nEventually, when they die, their soul ascends to the Divine Abode of God."

There is no difference among all these aspects of God. Therefore, one can meditate on any one or all of them.\n\n**What are the Eight Divine Aspects of God?**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1. **Kavi**: Like a poet who knows the entirety of his creation, God is omniscient. He is the seer who knows the past, present, and future.\n2. **Purāṇam**: God is the most ancient, and nothing predates Him. He is the origin of the entire material and spiritual world, but He has not originated from anything. God is without a beginning or an end.\n3. **Anuśhāsitāram**: God is the governor or the ruler. He administers His regime through the celestial gods that He has appointed or sometimes directly. He is the creator, and everything in this universe is under His control and run by His law.\n4. **Aṇoraṇīyān**: Here God is said to exist in the subtlest or subatomic form. The soul is subtler than matter, but God is even subtler than the soul, as He is seated within every soul.\n5. **Sarvasya Dhātā**: God is the source of sustenance. Similar to an ocean that sustains the waves and its vast marine ecology. God is the support for His entire creation.\n6. **Achintya rūpa**: God exists in inconceivable forms. Our mind and intellect are material in nature, and God is divine, thus, beyond our understanding. It is only through His grace one can understand Him. He bestows His divine grace and makes our mind divine by His Yogmaya power; only then can we know Him.\n7. **Āditya varṇa**: is one of the names of the sun god. Here, God is said to be dazzling like the sun.\n8. **Tamasaḥ Parastāt**: Similar to the sun that eradicates darkness, God with His effulgence eliminates ignorance.\n\n**What does this mean for us?**\n--------------------------------\n\nOne may ask, why so much variety. Western scholars often get confused by the various philosophies, paths, and instructions given in the Vedic scriptures. Therefore, it is stressed in the Hindu scriptures to study them under the guidance of an able Guru.\n\n**Why so many paths?**\n-----------------------\n\nWe all have different choices and natures according to our sanskārs (tendencies) from endless lifetimes. Consider this example of two people going into a cloth shop. The chances of both of them buying the same type, color, or style of clothes is very rare. Therefore, the shops keep a variety of clothes and cater to the choices and preferences of people. Similarly, the Vedic scriptures also offer various spiritual paths so that based on the level of sadhana (spiritual practice) we may have performed in our past lives, we may choose a suitable path. However, they simultaneously stress on bhakti or devotion to God that ties together all these paths in one common thread.\n\n**The Bhagavad Gita**\n---------------------\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita beautifully embraces varieties of sadhanas to cater to a large populace belonging to diverse backgrounds, upbringing, and natures. Bhakti involves focusing the mind upon God, in His various divine Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, etc. In its pure form, bhakti is called śhuddha bhakti. However, when undertaken along with ashtanga yoga, it is termed yog-miśhra bhakti or a fusion of devotion and ashtanga yoga sadhana.\n\n**Yog-miśhra Bhakti**\n----------------------\n\nShree Krishna has described yog-miśhra bhakti from verse ten to thirteen. In the practice of ashtanga yoga, the life force or prān shakti is channelized through suṣhumṇā nādi of the spinal column and then raised toward the third eye region between the eyebrows.

Therefore, He will not elaborate much and briefly describe this path of yog-miśhrā bhakti.\n\n**The Path of Yog-Miśhrā Bhakti**\n---------------------------------\n\nThis path of yog-miśhrā bhakti leads to attaining the formless aspect of God.

    "explanation": "**Understanding Verse 8.12**\n\nIt is through the senses and their objects the world enters our mind. When we see, hear, touch, taste, or smell an object of perception, it leaves an impression on our mind. Our mind then dwells upon these experiences, starts to contemplate, and creates repetitive thoughts that increase our attachment to the world.\n\n**The Importance of Controlling the Senses**\n\nA practitioner of meditation should guard himself against the incessant stream of worldly thoughts that the unrestrained senses can create. Locking the world out by restraining the mind and the senses; is most essential in meditation.\n\n**Key Concepts: Sarva-dvārāṇi-sanyamya and Hṛidi Nirudhya**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna uses the words:\n\n* `sarva-dvārāṇi-sanyamya`: which mean guarding the gates of the body.\n* `hṛidi nirudhya`: that means “locking the mind in the heart.”\n\n**The Practice of Yoga-Dhāraṇām**\n\nHe says that by controlling the passages that enter the body, one can lock the mind in the heart. Restricting the senses from their natural tendencies and directing the mind toward `akṣharam` (the imperishable Supreme Lord). Then with complete attention and devotional feelings, one should meditate on Him.\n\n**The Goal of Yoga-Dhāraṇām**\n\nHe ends the verse with `yoga-dhāraṇām`, which means “uniting the consciousness with God.” This union is the ultimate goal of meditation, where the practitioner transcends the limits of the physical world and experiences a deeper connection with the divine."

    "explanation": "**The Vedic Scriptures**\n======================\n\n### The Creation of Sound and Space\n\n8.13 The Vedic scriptures state that at the beginning of creation, God first created sound. With sound, He created space and then continued with the rest of the creation process. That primordial sound was the sacred syllable **Om**, it is also called **Pranav**— the sound manifestation of the Brahman. It represents the formless aspect of the Supreme Lord, without any attributes and virtues.\n\n**The Significance of Om**\n-----------------------\n\n### A Representation of the Supreme Lord\n\nThe sound **Om** pervades the entire creation; it is imperishable and infinite like God Himself. Hence, it is also called **anāhat nād**. In the Vedic philosophy, it is conferred as the **mahā vākya**, or the Great Sound Vibration of the Vedas and often attached to the beginning of the Vedic mantras, as **bīja** (seed or core) mantra similar to **hrīṁ**, **klīṁ**, etc.\n\n### Chanting the Sacred Word Om\n\nFor proper chanting of the sacred word **Om**, the emphasis is on the vibrations of three letters: A… U… M… One starts by making an \"A\" sound from the belly, with an open mouth and throat; it then merges into a \"U\" created in the middle of the mouth. Finally, it ends in chanting \"M\" with a closed mouth.\n\n**The Devotional Significance of Om**\n--------------------------------------\n\n### An Impersonal Form of God\n\nDevotees consider the word **Om** as the impersonal form of God. In **ashtanga yoga**, the **Praṇav** sound is considered the object of meditation. In this verse, Shree Krishna is describing the process of meditation with regard to the **ashtanga yoga** sadhana. He states that to focus the mind on God, one should chant \"**Óm**\" while practicing austerities and maintaining the vow of celibacy.\n\n### A Different Approach: Bhakti Yoga\n\nHowever, the devotees who take the path of **bhakti yoga** prefer to meditate upon the personal Names of the Lord. They experience greater sweetness in God's bliss when they meditate on; the personal Name and Forms of God, such as **Ram**, **Krishna**, **Shiv**, etc.\n\n### Comparison and Contrast\n\nIf you compare; the pleasure experienced by two ladies, one who is an expectant mother and one who has her new-born baby in her lap. The experience is much sweeter for the new mother. Seeing her beautiful baby, she even forgets the discomfort and pain she had experienced during childbirth.\n\n### The Final Test of Meditation\n\nThe time of death is the final test of our meditation. As death is said to be intensely painful and despite the pain, those who are able to focus on God even at that last moment; attain Him. And on leaving the body, their souls reach His divine abode. However, to achieve such a state is very difficult; it requires continuous practice throughout one's life.\n\n### A Easier Path to Meditation\n\nThe merciful Lord Krishna shows us an easier path in the next verse."

    "explanation": "# Meditation as per Ashtanga Yoga Sadhana\n8.14 In the previous verse, Shree Krishna had explained the process of meditation as per ashtanga yoga sadhana to focus on the formless God, devoid of any attributes. However, this practice is not only difficult but also very bland. Therefore, He suggests an alternative method, that is, to meditate upon the personal forms of God such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, Vishnu, etc., including their Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates. This method is simpler and helps in keeping the mind absorbed in God and His divine form.\n\n## The Need for Exclusive Devotion\nFor the first time in the Bhagavad Geeta, Shree Krishna says that He is easy to attain. But only to those yogis who are ananya-chetāḥ, which means their mind is absorbed exclusively in God. The word ananya etymologically means na anya, or \"no other.\" Thus, exclusive devotion is the precondition for attaining God.\n\n### Importance of Exclusive Devotion Throughout the Bhagavad Gita\nThroughout the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has stressed upon exclusive devotion and surrender to attain Him. As He mentioned:\n\n```\nananyāśh chintayanto māṁ\n9.22\n\ntam eva śharaṇaṁ gachchha\n18.62\n\nmām ekaṁ śharaṻaṁ vraja\n18.66\n```\n\nThis emphasizes the importance of exclusive devotion and devotion to one God alone.\n\n### Quotes from Vedic Scriptures\nOther Vedic scriptures also reiterate the same message:\n\n```\nmām ekam eva śharaṁ ātmānaṁ sarva-dehinām\n\n(Bhagavatam 11.12.15)\n```\n\nAnd from the Ramayan:\n\n```\neka bharoso eka bala ek āsa visvāsa\n(Ramayan)\n```\n\nThis confirms that the need for exclusive devotion and surrender is a constant theme in Hindu scriptures.\n\n### The Futility of Mixed Devotion\nMany spiritual seekers love God and try hard to attain Him, but their mind is also attached to the material world, their family, friends, pets, house, assets, etc. They contemplate upon God to purify their mind, but when they go back to their worldly relations, it gets dirty again. The worldly attachments are not only binding but also imperfect, thus cause impurity of the mind.\n\n## The Process of Purifying the Mind\nThe ultimate aim of sadhana is to purify the mind, which can only be done by attaching the mind to God, who is all-pure. In this verse, Shree Krishna says that it is not just devotion; but exclusive devotion; that is necessary to attain Him. Exclusive devotion is attainable only when a purified mind is absorbed in the Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the explanation from Shree Krishna in the Bhagavad Geeta highlights the importance of exclusive devotion and surrender to attain God. This approach, which involves attaching the mind to the personal forms of God, is simpler and more effective in keeping the mind absorbed in God. It emphasizes that exclusive devotion is necessary for attaining God and purifying the mind, which can only be achieved by surrendering to one God alone."

    "explanation": "**The Cycle of Birth, Death, and Spiritual Liberation**\n==========================================================\n\n### Attaining God: The End of Suffering\n\n8.15 When one attains God, the soul is liberated from the cycle of life and death. It reaches the divine abode of God and remains there forever, never taking birth in the material world again.\n\n### The Cycle of Suffering\n------------------------\n\nLife in the material world is full of suffering. The struggle starts inside the mother's womb itself, where we hang upside down for nine months.\n\n#### Pains of Birth and Growth\n-----------------------------\n\nThen we go through a painful process of taking birth and are delivered into an unknown world. We have to cry for our every need.\n\nAs we grow, we learn to speak, eat, walk, and perform other essential functions. Then comes the turmoil of adolescence, a mentally challenging phase.\n\n#### Struggles in Adulthood\n-------------------------\n\nAs adults, marriage and relationships test our endurance and patience to accept and accommodate individualities. We struggle to maintain social responsibilities.\n\nThen comes old age, with its gifts of sickness and disease. All through our life, we suffer from pain and miseries; induced by our own body, mind, people, or circumstances around us.\n\n#### The Final Struggle: Death\n-----------------------------\n\nFinally, we die, which is again an extremely painful experience.\n\n### Why God Allows Suffering\n-----------------------------\n\nBut why does God put us through so much pain and misery? The answer lies in His grand design. The purpose of these miseries is to realize that the material realm is not the permanent abode for the soul.\n\n#### Correction Home\n------------------\n\nThe material world serves as a correction home for souls who have forgotten God and are trapped in it. These sufferings and miseries help the souls develop the desire for God.\n\nConsider an example of a person who accidentally puts his hand on burning coal. Immediately, due to the burning sensation and pain he experiences, he withdraws his hand.\n\n### What Happens When We Touch the Burning Coal of Suffering?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen we touch the burning coal of suffering, our skin starts burning, and the neurons on our skin send a message to the brain of the pain we experience. The brain responds by sending commands to our hand muscles that remove us from the source of pain.\n\n### Pain as a Signal for Correction\n----------------------------------\n\nPain is a signal that something is not right and needs correction. Similarly, the pain and miseries we experience in the material world are a stimulation for us to shun our defective consciousness.\n\n### The Journey Towards Union with God\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThose worthy souls who commit themselves in exclusive devotion attain God and reach His Divine Abode. However, those souls who remain engrossed in material affluence and forget God continue to rotate in the cycle of birth and death.\n\n### The Law of Return\n----------------------\n\nEventually, we get what we make ourselves worthy of and the endeavours we choose to undertake.\n\n### Conclusion\n--------------\n\nThe cycle of birth, death, and spiritual liberation is a complex one. But by understanding the purpose of suffering and how it inspires us to seek union with God, we can begin our journey towards spiritual liberation."

These are — \n\n### The Seven Lower Planes\n\n*   **Tal**: Hell\n*   **Atal**: Despair\n*   **Vital**: Perishable\n*   **Sutal**: Endless Suffering\n*   **Talātal**: Endless Misery\n*   **Rasātal**: Endless Hunger\n*   **Pātāl**: The Lowest Plane\n\n**Similar References in Other Religions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Islam:** Mentions the seventh sky or the sātvāñ āsmān as the highest of the seven heavens.\n*   **Talmud (Jewish Law and Theology):** Enumerates seven heavens, the highest being Araboth.\n\n### The Concept of Lokas\n\nThese fourteen planes of existence are called the lokas or various worlds of our universe. The satyaḥ lok, also known as Brahma Lok, the abode of Brahma is the highest among them, and pātāl lok is the lowest. However, all these lokas are under the realm of Maya, the material energy of God.\n\n**The Cycle of Birth and Death**\n------------------------------\n\nIt is because of their impermanent nature Shree Krishna in the previous verse called these worlds to be aśhāśhvatam (temporary) and duḥkhālayam (full of misery). All those who are born in these lokas of material existence are subject to death someday. Even the king of the celestial gods, Indra, has to die.\n\n**The Story of Indra and Vishwakarma**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Puranas mention an incident where Indra ordered the celestial architect, Vishwakarma, to construct a huge palace for himself in Swarga. However, the extension plan kept on increasing, and the construction was not ending. Vishwakarma got weary and prayed to God for help.\n\nGod visited Indra and enquired, \"How many Vishwakarmas have you engaged in constructing such a huge palace?\" Indra was surprised by God’s question because he thought there was only one Vishwakarma. Smiling, God said to Indra, \"Similar to this universe with its fourteen worlds, there are infinite universes. And each universe has an Indra and a Vishwakarma\".\n\n**The Ants Representing Past Lives**\n--------------------------------------\n\nAt the same time, Indra saw several ants walking toward him in queues. Surprised, he asked God; where all these ants were coming from. God said, \"All these ants were Indras in their past lives; I have called them to meet you\". Indra was speechless.\n\n**The Rishi Lomash**\n------------------\n\nSoon after, a revered sage, Rishi Lomash, visited Indra. He was carrying a straw mat on his head and had a circle of hair on his chest. However, there were gaps in that circle, made by fallen hair. Indra received the sage respectfully and then asked him politely; why he was carrying a mat on his head? Also, what does the hair on his chest signify?\n\nThe Rishi said, \"I am blessed with a boon, to be chirāyu (endless life). The hair on my chest signifies life on this universe. Whenever the tenure of an Indra ends, one hair falls. And several such falls have caused the gaps in my chest hair\". Indra was astonished.\n\n**The Humility of Indra**\n----------------------\n\nLomash Rishi then added, \"I carry this mat on my head because during the day it protects me from sun and rain. Also, I spread it on the ground at night and sleep. My disciples want to build a permanent residence for me to stay. But I think, when life itself is temporary, why build a house here?\" Hearing this from someone who has the lifespan of many Indras; humbled Indra. His pride shattered, he thought to himself, \"What is the point in building such a huge palace, if someday, I have to leave it all and go?\" He asked Vishwakarma to stop the construction immediately and released him.\n\n**The Cosmology of the Universe**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIt is marvellous how these stories from the Puranas and the Bhagavad Gita give an insight into; cosmology of the universe. Amazingly, these scriptures were written in ancient times, several thousand years ahead of modern astronomy.\n\n**The Advancement of Astronomy**\n---------------------------------\n\nIt was only in the sixteenth century that a western scientist, Nicholas Copernicus, first proposed a heliocentric theory stating that; the sun was the centre of the universe. This theory changed the previous belief that the earth was the centre of the universe.\n\n**The Vedic Philosophy**\n----------------------\n\nFurther advancement in astronomy revealed that even the sun was not the centre of the universe. It was part of a galaxy called the milky way having countless stars like our sun, each with its own solar system. And all stars, along with their solar systems, are revolving around the epicentre of the galaxy.\n\nHowever, the Vedic philosophy states that the earth or the Bhūr Lok is revolving around Swar Lok, and the realm between them is Bhuvar Lok. The Swar Lok is again moving around Jana Lok, and the realm between these two is the Mahar Lok. Jana Lok is also not stationary and is circling the Brahma Lok (Satya Lok), and Tapa Lak is the realm between them.\n\n**The Seven Higher Planes Again**\n---------------------------------\n\nThese are the seven higher planes, and similarly, there are seven lower planes as well. It is incredible; that our Vedic scholars had such insight into the subject over five thousand years ago.\n\n**The Concept of Maya**\n-------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna states that all the fourteen worlds of this universe are within the realm of His material energy Maya. Hence, the occupants are subject to the cycle of birth and death.\n\n**The Liberation from Maya**\n-----------------------------\n\nOnly those who attain God-realization get liberated from the clutches of maya. Upon death, they leave their material bodies and go to His divine abode to stay there forever. They receive divine bodies and participate in the divine Pastimes of God eternally.\n\n**The Role of Saints and Pious Souls**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThey need not take birth in the material world. However, some saints and pious souls come back to the material world. Although liberated, they do so to engage in the divine welfare of humankind. These pious souls are the great Masters and Prophets.\n\n**The Descending of Saints**\n---------------------------\n\nThey descend on earth to help others get out of the bondage of maya."

    "explanation": "**Vedic Cosmological System: Understanding Time and Cycles**\n\nThe Vedic cosmological system has measurements of time that are vast and astounding. Consider this example of an insect, that is, born at night and within the same night it grows, procreates, lays eggs, and grows old. The next morning, you find it dead under the street light. If one tells that insect that its entire lifespan was only equal to one night of a human, that will be unbelievable for the insect. Similarly, the measurements of time given in the Vedas are beyond normal human imagination.\n\n**Vedic Calculations of Time Periods**\n\nThe Vedas state that one year on the earth equals one day and night of Indra and other celestial gods. Thus, one year of the celestial gods consisting of 12 x 30 days equals:\n\n- **Kali Yug:** 432,000 years\n- **Dwāpar Yug:** 864,000 years\n- **Tretā Yug:** 1,296,000 years\n- **Satya Yug:** 1,728,000 years\n- **Mahā Yug:** 4,320,000 years (Adding the four yugas)\n- **Kalp:** 4,320,000,000 years (1000 Mahā Yug = 1 day of Brahma)\n\n**Brahma's Life Cycle and the Universe's Duration**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna states that only those who understand this knowledge truly know what day and night are.\n\nAccording to Vedas, the duration of the universe equals Brahma's lifespan, of 100 years. Brahma's one day and night put together make 8.64 billion earth years, and 36,000 such days of his lifespan would make:\n\n- **311 trillion 40 billion years**\n\nSo, that will be one life cycle of our universe.\n\n**The Cycle of Birth and Death in Brahma**\n\nNow the question arises; when Brahma is a creator, why is he also subject to birth and death?\n\nBrahma is also a soul; who has reached tremendously elevated consciousness. Thus, God has given him the position of Brahma, to discharge the duties as a creator on God's behalf. But like all other living creatures, Brahma is also under the cycle of life and death.\n\nHowever, at the end of his tenure, he is liberated and goes to the Abode of God. Sometimes, at the creation of the world, when God does not find any eligible souls for the position of Brahma, God Himself becomes Brahma."

    "explanation": "**The Cosmic Play of Creation and Destruction**\n\nThe cosmic play of the various planes of existence in the universe is astounding. The fourteen worlds and their planetary systems undergo repeated cycles of **sṇiṣṭi, sthiti, and pralaya** (creation, preservation, and dissolution).\n\n### The Cycles of Creation and Destruction\n\nAll planetary systems, up to the **Mahar Lok**, are destroyed at the end of a **kalp;** that is Brahma’s day of 4.32 billion years. This partial dissolution is called **naimittik pralaya**.\n\n### A Parable from the Shrimad Bhagavatam\n\nWhen Shukdev Paramhans narrated the **Shrimad Bhagavatam** to Parikshit, he stated that Brahma creates these worlds similar to a child playing with his toys. A child builds structures with his toys during the day and pulls them apart before going to bed at night. Similarly, when Brahma wakes up, he creates the planetary systems and their life forms and dissolves them before going to sleep.\n\n### The Great Dissolution\n\nThe entire universe dissolves at the end of Brahma’s life of 100 years (311.04 trillion earth years). The whole material creation winds up.\n\n### The Merging of the Five Elements\n\nThe **pañch-mahābhūta** (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) merge into the **pañch-tanmātrās** (the five senses), which in turn merge into **ahankār** (ego), and then **ahankār** merges into **mahān**, and finally, **mahān** merges into **prakṛiti** (the subtle form of Maya).\n\n### The Return of Prakṛiti\n\n**Prakṛiti** is the material energy of God. Maya now takes up her primordial form and goes back into the body of the Supreme Lord, Maha Vishnu.\n\n### The Great Dissolution (Prākṛit Pralaya)\n\nThis great dissolution is called **prākṛit pralaya**, or **mahāpralaya**. When it is time for the next cycle of creation, Maha Vishnu glances at **prakṛiti**, and by His mere glance, **prakṛiti** starts unfolding herself again.\n\n### The Process of Creation\n\nFrom **prakṛiti**, **mahān** is created, from **mahān**, **ahankār**; then from **ahankār**, the **pañch-tanmātrās** are created; from the **pañch-tanmātrās**, the **pañch-mahābhūta** get created. And by this process, unlimited universes are created again.\n\n### The Multiverse\n\nAccording to modern science, there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. And similar to the Milky Way, there are over a billion galaxies in the universe. Thus, scientists have concluded that in our universe, there are more than 10^20 stars.\n\n### The Infinite Universes\n\nHowever, the Vedas state that, similar to our universe, there are infinite universes of various sizes and different features. These universes manifest from the body of Maha Vishnu. Every time He breathes in infinite universes are created from the pores of His divine body.\n\n### The Breathing of Maha Vishnu\n\nAnd when He breathes out, they dissolve again. Thus, one breath of Maha Vishnu is equal to 100 years of Brahma’s life.\n\n### The End and Beginning\n\nAll these universes have their own Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankar. In the innumerable universes, there are innumerable Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shankars. The entire creation originates from Maha Vishnu, and at dissolution, merges back into Him.\n\n**The Cosmic Play of Creation and Destruction**\n\nIn conclusion, the cosmic play of creation and destruction is an ongoing process that never ends. It begins again with every breath of Maha Vishnu, creating new universes and ending old ones in an eternal cycle.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The universe undergoes repeated cycles of creation, preservation, and destruction.\n*   Brahma creates the planetary systems and their life forms only to destroy them at the end of a **kalp**.\n*   The process of creation is cyclical, with each cycle beginning and ending with the breath of Maha Vishnu.\n\n**The Cosmic Play of Creation and Destruction**\n\nThis cycle is an eternal one, with no beginning or end. It is a never-ending process that begins and ends with the breath of Maha Vishnu.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cosmic play of creation and destruction is an astounding phenomenon that never ends. It is a cycle that begins again with every breath of Maha Vishnu, creating new universes and ending old ones in an eternal cycle.\n\n### References\n\n*   **Shrimad Bhagavatam**: A Hindu scripture that narrates the story of creation and destruction.\n*   **Vedas**: Ancient Hindu scriptures that describe the universe and its cycles.\n\n**The Cosmic Play of Creation and Destruction**\n\nThis cycle is an eternal one, with no beginning or end. It is a never-ending process that begins and ends with the breath of Maha Vishnu.\n\n### The Cosmic Play of Creation and Destruction\n\nThis cycle is an eternal one, with no beginning or end. It is a never-ending process that begins and ends with the breath of Maha Vishnu.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cosmic play of creation and destruction is an astounding phenomenon that never ends.

    "explanation": "### Four Forms of Pralayas or Dissolution\n#### Enumerated in the Vedas\n\nThe ancient Hindu scriptures, the Vedas, describe four forms of dissolution or pralayas. These concepts are essential to understanding the nature of reality and the human experience.\n\n### 8.19 Nitya Pralaya: Daily Dissolution\n\nEvery night, when we fall into a deep sleep, our consciousness goes through dissolution daily. This type of pralaya occurs when the mind and senses become dormant, and our awareness is suspended.\n\n### 8.20 Naimittik Pralaya: Brahma's Day Dissolution\n\nAt the end of Brahma’s day, all the abodes up to the Mahar Lok dissolute, and all the souls residing there become unmanifest. They remain in a state of suspended animation in the body of Vishnu, waiting for the next cycle of creation. When Brahma creates these lokas again, these souls are reborn based on their past karmas.\n\n### 8.21 Mahā Pralaya: Brahma's Life Dissolution\n\nAt the end of Brahma’s life, this entire universe goes into dissolution. Again, all the souls of the universe unmanifest and stay in the body of Maha Vishnu. Their gross (sthūl) and subtle (sūkṣhma) body dissolve, but their causal body (kāraṇ sharīr) stays. In the next cycle of creation, these souls are reborn based on their past karmas and past sanskārs, which the soul’s causal body stores and carries with it.\n\n### 8.22 Ātyantik Pralaya: Liberation from Maya\n\nThis is the dissolution from the clutches of maya that has been binding the soul since eternity. It takes place when the soul finally attains God and is liberated forever from the cycle of birth and death.\n\n**Understanding the Four Pralayas**\n\n| Type of Pralaya | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Nitya Pralaya | Daily dissolution during deep sleep |\n| Naimittik Pralaya | Dissolution at the end of Brahma's day, with souls waiting for rebirth |\n| Mahā Pralaya | Dissolution at the end of Brahma's life, with souls reborn based on past karmas |\n| Ātyantik Pralaya | Liberation from the cycle of birth and death, where souls attain God |\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n* The four pralayas are described in the Vedas as essential concepts for understanding reality and the human experience.\n* Each type of pralaya represents a different stage in the dissolution of the universe and the individual soul.\n* The Ātyantik Pralaya represents liberation from the cycle of birth and death, where the soul attains God."

    "explanation": "**The Omnipresent Nature of God**\n====================================\n\nGod is present everywhere. The same Supreme Lord who resides in the spiritual sky in His divine abode, at the same time, is seated in the hearts of every living creature. He is all-pervading and present in every atom of the material world. It is not that He is a hundred percent God in His personal form and ten percent when He is in our hearts or anywhere else in the material world. God exists a hundred percent in all His forms.\n\nDue to our ignorance, we are unable to recognize His presence within us or all around us.\n\n**The Example of Milk and Yogurt**\n---------------------------------\n\nSage Shandilya states in his Bhakti Darshan:\n\ngavāṁ sarpiḥ śharīrasthaṁ na karotyaṅga poṣhaṇam\n\n“Milk resides in the body of the cow, but it does not benefit the health of the cow, which is weak and sick.” When the same milk is converted to yogurt and fed to the cow with a little black pepper, it cures the cow; of its illness.\n\nLikewise, it is difficult to develop devotion for an omnipresent or all-pervading God. Worshiping Him in His divine form helps us purify our heart, which is necessary to attract His divine grace. Because, to perceive God’s divinity, we need our senses to be divine.\n\n**The Role of Bhakti in God Realization**\n---------------------------------------\n\nBy His grace, His divine energy Yogmaya instills in us divine senses, mind, and intellect so that we could know both His all-pervading aspect and His personal form.\n\nThus, in this verse, Shree Krishna declares that only through bhakti can we know Him.\n\n**The Importance of Bhakti in the Bhagavad Gita**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has repeatedly emphasized upon the need for bhakti to know God and attain Him. The verse 6.47 states:\n\nShree Krishna considers those engaged in devotion as the highest in position among His devotees. However, in this verse, Shree Krishna explicitly adds the term ananyayā, which means “by no other path” can one know God.\n\n**The Supremacy of Bhakti**\n---------------------------\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu very nicely said:\n\nbhakti mukha nirīkṣhaka karm yoga jñāna\n\n“Although karma, jnana, and ashtanga yoga are also pathways to God-realization, all these require the support of bhakti for their fulfillment.”\n\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj also said:\n\nkarm yog aru jñāna saba, sādhana yadapi bakhān\npai binu bhakti sabai janu, mṛitaka deha binu prān\n\n“Although karma, jnana, and ashtanga yoga are paths to God-realization, without blending bhakti in them, they all become like dead bodies without life-airs.”\n\n**The Uniqueness of Bhakti**\n---------------------------\n\nVarious other scriptures also announce the same:\n\nbhaktyāhamekayā grāhyaḥ śhraddhayātmā priyaḥ satām   \n(Bhagavatam 11.14.21)\n\n“I am only attained by My devotees who worship Me with faith and love.”\n\nmilahiṅ na raghupati binu anurāgā, kieñ joga tapa gyāna birāgā   \n(Ramayan)\n\n“One may practice ashtanga yoga, engage in austerities, accumulate knowledge, and develop detachment. Yet, without devotion, one will never attain God.”"

But this position is also part of the material world, thus temporary.\n\n*   When their merits are exhausted, they have to return to earth\n*   Ultimately all humans born on earth, upon death, have to pass along either of the two paths, the path of light or the path of darkness\n\n### Karmas and the Path of Life\n---------------------------------\n\nIt is their karmas that decide which path they would take eventually.\n\n*   The choices made during life determine the soul's fate in death\n*   The cycle of life and death repeats until the karmas are fulfilled"

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Paths of Light and Darkness**\n=====================================================\n\nThose relentless souls who strive for **Yog** or union with God are true yogis. They recognize themselves to be tiny fragments of God and His eternal beatitude. They also realize the temporary nature of the material world and the futility of a materialistic life. Therefore, instead of running behind sensual pleasures, they endeavour to enhance their love for God. Such souls are on the path of light.\n\n**The Path of Darkness**\n------------------------\n\nOn the other hand, are the ignorant souls, who are under the influence of **maya**, the material energy. They recognize themselves as only the body and the material world around them as the source of their pleasure. They continue to live through the miseries of material existence, being disdainful toward God or His eternal opulence. Thus, such souls are on the path of darkness.\n\n**The Importance of Choosing the Path of Light**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna urges Arjun to recognize the difference between these two paths and choose the path of light, thus becoming a yogi. It is not that many of us do not take the path of light, but after some time, we are back on the path of darkness.\n\n**A Analogy to Understand the Concept**\n------------------------------------------\n\nFor instance, someone wishes to go east and walks one mile toward the rising sun in the morning. He rests in the afternoon for a while. Then he starts walking again toward the sun, which is now in the west. He walks for two miles only to find in the evening that he is one mile farther in the west from where he had started.\n\n**The Limitation of Temporary Efforts**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, treading on the path of light only for some time will not work; it needs to be a constant process, else one will slip back into darkness again. Therefore, in this verse, Shree Krishna adds the phrase, “at all times.” It is for us to recognize the importance of being a yogi at all times. And avoid the danger of sliding back into the path of darkness.\n\n**The Key to Success**\n----------------------\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the difference between the paths of light and darkness is crucial. By recognizing our true nature as fragments of God, we can choose the path that leads us to spiritual growth and enlightenment. It is our responsibility to strive for yoga at all times, avoiding the temptation of material pleasures and the path of darkness."

    "explanation": "**The Path of Light**\n======================\n\nIn the last verse of this chapter, Shree Krishna declares that: those yogis who follow the path of light reap the fruits of their endeavours beyond any other processes can bestow. He says that even though one may undertake Vedic sacrifices, perform austerities, charity, or accumulate knowledge of the self, but without devotion to God, it is not the path of light.\n\n**The Fruits of Devotion**\n-------------------------\n\nAccording to the Ramayan, devotion to God is the key to unlocking the path of light.\n\n> \"You may engage in good conduct, righteousness, austerities, sacrifices, ashtanga yoga, chanting of mantras, and charity. But without devotion to God, the mind's disease of material consciousness will not cease.\"\n\n**Material Rewards vs. Spiritual Liberation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAll these good deeds can only reap material rewards, which are temporary. However, devotion to God leads to liberation from the bondage of the material world.\n\n**The Detachment of the Mind**\n-----------------------------\n\nTherefore, the yogis who have realized this truth detach their mind from the material world and attach it to God alone. Treading on this path of light, they eventually attain eternal happiness.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n-----------------\n\n*   Devotion to God is the key to unlocking the path of light.\n*   Without devotion, even good deeds can only reap material rewards.\n*   Devotion leads to liberation from the bondage of the material world.\n*   Detaching the mind from the material world and attaching it to God alone is essential for achieving spiritual liberation."

    "explanation": "**Qualification for Hearing Divine Teachings**\n\nAt the very beginning of the topic, Shree Krishna declares the qualification for hearing these teachings. \n\n### Anasūyave: Non-Envious and One Who Does Not Scorn\n\nAnasūyave \nmeans “non-envious.” He tells Arjun that He is revealing this knowledge because Arjun is non-envious of Him. Lord Krishna clarifies this because God is going to glorify Himself profusely here.\n\n#### Clarifying the True Nature of the Divine\n\nAnasūyave \nalso has the sense of “one who does not scorn.” Those listeners who deride Shree Krishna because they believe He is boasting will not benefit from hearing such a message. Rather, they will incur harm, by thinking, “Look at this egotistic person. He is praising His own Self.”\n\n#### The Dangers of Envy and Arrogance\n\nSuch an attitude is born of arrogance and pride and it robs a person of devotional reverence. Envious people cannot grasp the simple fact that God has no need for anything, and therefore everything He does is for the welfare of the souls. He only praises Himself to enhance devotion in the souls, and not because He has the material defect of conceit as we do.\n\n#### Understanding the Compassion Behind Divine Statements\n\nWhen Jesus of Nazareth said, “I am the path and the way,” he was saying it motivated by compassion for the souls listening to him, and not out of vanity. As a true Guru, he was telling his disciples that the path to God is through the Guru. But the envious-minded do not understand the compassion behind these statements and attribute them to self-conceit.\n\n#### The Qualification of Arjun\n\nSince Arjun is magnanimous and free from the defect of envy, he is eminently qualified for the profound knowledge that Shree Krishna is going to reveal in this chapter.\n\n### The Progression of Divine Knowledge\n\nIn the second chapter, Shree Krishna explained the knowledge of the \nātmā\n (soul) as a separate and distinct entity from the body. That is \nguhya\n, or secret knowledge.\n\n#### The Progression of Divine Knowledge\n\nIn the seventh and eighth chapters, He explained knowledge of His powers, which is \nguhyatar\n, or more secret.\n\n#### The Most Profound Knowledge\n\nAnd in the ninth and subsequent chapters, He will reveal knowledge of His pure bhakti, which is \nguhyatam\n, or the most secret."

    "explanation": "### Rāja\n#### Meaning and Significance\n\nmeans \"king.\" Shree Krishna uses the metaphor rāja to emphasize the paramount position of the knowledge He is going to reveal. Vidyā means \"science.\" He does not refer to His teachings as creed, religion, dogma, doctrine, or belief. He declares that what He is going to describe to Arjun is the king of sciences.\n\n### Guhya\n#### The Secret of Devotion\n\nGuhya means \"secret.\" This knowledge is also the supreme secret. Since love is only possible where there is a choice, God deliberately hides Himself from direct perception, thereby providing the soul the freedom to exercise the choice of loving Him or not. A machine cannot love, for it is devoid of choices. God wants us to love Him and so He gives us the option to choose Him or not, as we wish. He merely makes us aware of the consequences of what we choose, either way, and then leaves it to us to decide the path we wish to follow.\n\n### Pavitram\n#### The Pure Knowledge of Devotion\n\nPavitram means \"pure.\" Knowledge of devotion is supremely pure because it is untainted by petty selfishness. It inspires sacrifice of the self at the altar of divine love for the Supreme Lord. Bhakti also purifies the devotee by destroying pāp, bīja, and avidyā.\n\n#### Understanding Pāp, Bīja, and Avidyā\n\nPāp is the stockpile of past sins of endless lifetimes of the individual soul. Bhakti burns them up as a fire burns up a bundle of straw.\n\nBīja refers to impurities of the heart, which are the seeds of sinful activities. If the seeds exist, then destroying the results of past sins will not suffice, for the propensity to sin will remain in the heart and one will sin again. Bhakti purifies the heart and destroys the seeds of sin, which are lust, anger, and greed.\n\nHowever, even the destruction of the seeds is not enough. The reason why the heart becomes impure is that there is avidyā (ignorance), because of which we identify with the body. Because of this misidentification, we think of the body as the self, and hence create bodily desires thinking they will give happiness to the self. Fulfillment of such material desires further leads to lust, anger, greed, and all the other impurities of the heart.\n\n### Pratyakṣha\n#### Direct Perception\n\nPratyakṣha means \"directly perceptible.\" The practice of the science of bhakti begins with a leap of faith and results in direct perception of God. It is not unlike the methodology of other sciences, where we begin an experiment with a hypothesis and conclude with a verified result.\n\n### Dharmyam\n#### Virtuous Devotion\n\nDharmyam means \"virtuous.\" Devotion performed without desire for material rewards is the most virtuous action. It is continuously nourished by righteous acts such as service to the Guru.\n\n### Kartum Susukham\n#### Easy Practice\n\nKartum susukham means \"very easy to practice.\" God does not need anything from us; He is attained very naturally if we can learn to love Him.\n\n#### Why People Struggle with Devotion\n\nWhen this is the sovereign science and it is easy to practice, then why do people not apply themselves to learning it? Shree Krishna explains this next."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Faith in Spiritual Growth**\n=====================================================\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna explains the importance of faith in spiritual growth. In verse 3, He promises knowledge and then qualifies it with eight merits. The path to loving devotion to God is called \"this dharma,\" or the path of spiritual growth.\n\n**The Need for Faith**\n-------------------\n\nNo matter how wonderful the knowledge and how effective the path, it remains useless to one who refuses to walk on it. As explained in the previous verse, direct perception of God comes later; initially, a leap of faith is required to begin the process.\n\n**The Bhakti Rasamrit Sindhu**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Bhakti Rasamrit Sindhu (1.4.15) states:\n\nādau śhraddhā tataḥ sādhusaṅgo ’tha bhajanakriyā\n\n\n“The first step in the path to God-realization is to have faith. Then one begins participating in \nsatsaṅg\n (spiritual programs). This leads to the personal practice of devotion.”\n\n**The Dangers of Refusing Faith**\n---------------------------------\n\nOften people say that they are only willing to believe in what they can directly perceive, and since there is no immediate perception of God, they do not believe in Him. However, the fact is that we believe in so many things in the world too, without direct perception of them.\n\n**Real-Life Analogies**\n----------------------\n\nA judge delivers judgment upon a case concerning an event that took place many years in the past. If the judge adopted the philosophy of believing only what he or she had directly experienced, then the entire legal system would fail.\n\nA President administers a country on the basis of reports from all over the country. It is impossible for him to visit and see all the villages and cities within his domain. Now, if he was not willing to believe these reports, on the grounds that he had no direct perception of what was happening, how would he be able to administer the whole country?\n\n**The Importance of Faith in Material Activities**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, even in material activities, faith is required at every step. The Bible states this very nicely: “We walk by faith, and not by sight.” (2 Corinthians 5:7)\n\n**The Story of the King and the Sadhu**\n---------------------------------------\n\nThere is a beautiful story regarding perception of God. A king once accosted a sadhu with the statement, “I do not believe in God because I cannot see Him.” The sadhu asked for a cow to be brought to king’s court. The king obliged and ordered his servants to bring a cow.\n\nThe sadhu then requested that it be milked. The king again instructed his servants to do as the sadhu wanted. The sadhu asked, “O King! Do you believe that this milk, freshly taken out from the cow, contains butter?”\n\nThe king said he had full faith that it did. The sadhu said, “You cannot see the butter in the milk. Then why do you believe it is there?” The king replied, “We cannot see it at present because the butter is pervading the milk, but there is a process for seeing it. If we convert the milk into yogurt, and then churn the yogurt, the butter will become visible.”\n\nThe sadhu said, “Like the butter in the milk, God is everywhere. If we cannot immediately perceive Him, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is no God. There is a process for perceiving Him; if we are willing to have faith and follow the process, we will then get direct perception of God and become God-realized.”\n\n**The Power of Faith**\n---------------------\n\nBelief in God is not a natural process that we as human beings just follow. We have to exercise our free will and actively make a decision to have faith in God.\n\nIn the assembly of the Kauravas, when Dushasan endeavored to disrobe Draupadi, Lord Krishna saved her from shame and embarrassment by lengthening her sari. All the Kauravas present saw this miracle, but refused to have faith in the omnipotence of Shree Krishna and come to their senses.\n\nThe Supreme Lord says in this verse that those who choose not to have faith in the spiritual path remain bereft of divine wisdom and continue rotating in the cycle of life and death.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn conclusion, faith is a crucial aspect of spiritual growth. It requires us to have confidence in the process and trust that it will lead to direct perception of God. By exercising our free will and actively making a decision to have faith, we can overcome the limitations of our perception and become God-realized."

    "explanation": "**The Vedic Philosophy of God's Existence**\n\n### The Nature of God According to the Vedas\n\nThe Vedic philosophy does not accept the concept of God creating the world and then peeping into it from the seventh heaven to check whether His world is running all right. They repeatedly propound the theme of God being all-pervading in the world:\n\n\"Ekō devaḥ sarvabhūteṣhu gūḍhaḥ sarvavyāpī\" (Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 6.11)\n\n\"There is one God; He is seated in everyone's heart; He is also everywhere in the world.\"\n\n### The Concept of God's Pervasion\n\nThe concept of God being everywhere is understood subjectively. Some Eastern philosophers claim that the world is a **pariṇām** (transformation) of God.\n\n**Examples of Pariṇām**\n\n* Milk is an unadulterated substance. In contact with acid, it transforms to yogurt.\n* Yogurt is a **pariṇām** (effect or product) of milk, when it is transformed.\n* Similarly, the protagonists of ** pariṇām** vāda state that God has transformed into the world.\n\n### Alternative Interpretations\n\nOther philosophers claim that the world is **vivarta** (to mistake one object for another).\n\n**Examples of Vivarta**\n\n* In the darkness, a rope may be mistaken for a snake.\n* In the moonlight, a shining oyster may be mistaken for silver.\n\n**The Reality of Pariṇām and Vivarta**\n\nHowever, according to verses 7.4 and 7.5, the world is neither **pariṇām** nor **vivarta**. It is created from the material energy of God, called Maya śhakti.\n\n### The Nature of the Soul and Maya\n\nThe souls too are the energy of God, but they are His superior energy, called Jīva śhakti. Therefore, the world and all the souls in it are both God's energies and are within His personality.\n\n**The Limitations of Maya and Jīva**\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna also says that He does not dwell in the living beings, i.e. the infinite is not contained by the finite beings.\n\n**The Relationship Between God and Maya/Jīva**\n\nJust as an ocean throws up many waves, and these waves are a part of the ocean, but the ocean is much more than the sum total of the waves,\n\nsimilarly too, the souls and Maya exist within the personality of God, yet He is beyond them."

    "explanation": "**Beyond the Two Energies Mentioned in the Previous Verse—Maya śhakti and Jīva**\n\n### śhakti\n\n#### Definition of śhakti\nThere is a third energy of God, which He refers to in this verse as divine energy. This energy is called Yogmaya.\n\n#### Characteristics of Yogmaya\nYogmaya, which He refers to in this verse as divine energy, is God's all-powerful energy. It is called *kartum-akartum-samarthaḥ*, or \"that which can make the impossible possible,\" and is responsible for many of the amazing things we attribute to His personality.\n\n#### Examples of Yogmaya's Power\nFor example, God is seated in our hearts, yet we have no perception of Him. This is because His divine Yogmaya power keeps us aloof from Him.\n\n#### Yoga Maya's Role in Keeping God Aloof from the Influence of Maya\nSimilarly, God also keeps Himself aloof from the influence of Maya. In the Bhagavatam, the Vedas praise the Lord:\n\n> \"Maya feels embarrassed to even stand before God.\" - Vilajjamānayā yasya sthātumīkṣhā-pathe 'uyā (2.5.13)\nIsn't it a wonder that although God pervades Maya, the material energy, yet He is aloof from it? This is again by the mysterious power of Yogmaya.\n\n#### The Mystery of God's Relationship with Maya\nIf the world could influence God, then when it decays or is destroyed, His nature and personality will also deteriorate. But despite all modifications in the world, God remains established in His personality.\n\n#### The Concept of Daśhāṅgulī\nAccordingly, the Vedas call God by the name Daśhāṅgulī, or \"ten fingers.\" He is in the world, and yet ten fingers beyond it—untouched by it.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   God's divine energy is called Yogmaya.\n*   Yogmaya is all-powerful and responsible for many amazing things attributed to God's personality.\n*   Yog Maya keeps us aloof from God, and similarly, God keeps Himself aloof from the influence of Maya.\n*   Despite the decay or destruction of the world, God's nature and personality remain established."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Shree Krishna's Concept of Mat Sthāni**\n\nShree Krishna has used the term \"mat sthāni\" three times, from the fourth verse to the sixth verse. It means \"all living beings rest in Him.\" They cannot be separated from Him even though they transmigrate in different bodies and accept affinity with matter.\n\n**Difficulty Conceiving the World Resting in God**\n\nIt may be a little difficult to conceive how the world rests in God. Greek mythology shows a picture of Atlas holding up the globe. In Greek folklore, Atlas fought with the Titans in the war against the deities of Mount Olympus. As punishment, he was condemned to forever bear the earth and the heavens on his back with the great pillar that supposedly separates them on his shoulders.\n\n**Contrasting with Shree Krishna's Meaning**\n\nThis is not what Shree Krishna means when He says that He is upholding all beings. The entire cosmos exists in space and space is created by God's energy. Thus, all beings can be said to be resting in Him.\n\n**An Analogy to Understand the Concept**\n\nThe Supreme Lord now gives an analogy to enable Arjun to grasp the concept. The wind has no existence independent from the sky. It moves incessantly and furiously, and yet, it rests within the sky. Likewise, the souls have no existence independent of God. They move in time, place, and consciousness, through transitory bodies, sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly, and yet, they always exist within God.\n\n**Perspective from the Cosmos**\n\nFrom another perspective, everything that exists in cosmos is subordinate to the will of God. It is created, maintained, and annihilated in accordance with His will. In this way also, everything can be said to be resting in Him.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n*   All living beings rest in God, even when they transmigrate in different bodies.\n*   The concept of mat sthāni emphasizes the unity and interconnectedness of all existence.\n*   The analogy of the wind resting in the sky highlights the dependence of souls on God.\n*   Everything in the cosmos is subordinate to the will of God, which governs creation, maintenance, and destruction."

How then, one may wonder, does it perform the wonderful work of creating such an amazing world?\n\n### The Ramayan's Explanation\n\nThe Ramayan explains this well:\n\n`jāsu satyatā teṅ jaṛa māyā, bhāsa satya iva moha sahāyā.`\n\n\"The material energy is insentient by itself. But when it receives inspiration from God, it begins to act as if it were sentient.\" This is like a pair of tongs in the kitchen. They are lifeless by themselves. But in the hands of a chef, they come to life and do wonderful things such as lifting red-hot bowls. Likewise, by itself, the material energy does not have the power to do anything.\n\n### The Role of God in Creation\n\nWhen God wishes to create the world, He glances at the material energy and animates it. The main idea to keep in mind is that although the process of creation goes on by His will and inspiration of God, He remains unaffected by the work of the material energy. He remains ever-blissful and undisturbed in His personality, by virtue of His `hlāndinī śhakti` (bliss-giving power).\n\n### God's Unaffected Nature\n\nHence, the Vedas call Him `ātmārām`, meaning “He who rejoices in Himself, without any need for external pleasures.”\n\n### The Non-Doger and Supervisor\n\nHaving explained that He is unaffected, God now explains that He is the non-doer and the Supervisor.\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- The material energy is inert and insentient.\n- It requires inspiration from God to act as if it were sentient.\n- God remains unaffected by the work of material energy.\n- He is ever-blissful and undisturbed in His personality.\n- The Vedas call Him `ātmārām`, meaning \"He who rejoices in Himself, without any need for external pleasures.\"\n- God is the non-doer and the Supervisor."

If He can do such an amazing feat of creating myriad forms in the world, can He not create a form for Himself?\n\n**The Corollary**\n-----------------\n\nTo say that God cannot possess a personal form makes Him incomplete. We tiny souls also possess forms. If one holds that God cannot possess a form, then the corollary is that He has even less power than us human beings.\n\n**The Vedic Scriptures**\n------------------------\n\nHowever, the Vedic scriptures state that God must have both attributes to His personality—a personal aspect and a formless aspect.\n\n*   apaśhyaṁ gopāṁ anipadyamānamā (Rig Veda 1.22.164 sūkta 31): \"I had the vision of God as a boy who is never annihilated, and who appeared in a family of cowherds.\"\n*   dwibhūjaṁ mauna mudrāḍhyaṁ vana mālinamīśhwaram (Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad 1.13): \"The Lord, wearing a garland of forest flowers, plays His flute, enchantingly forming the mauna mudrā with His hands.\"\n*   gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣhya-liṅgam (Bhagavatam 7.15.75): \"The deepest knowledge is that God accepts a human-like form.\"\n*   yatrāvatīrṇo bhagavān paramātmā narākṛitiḥ (Bhagavatam 9.23.20): \"At that time, the Supreme Lord, who possesses all opulences, descended in a human-like form.\"\n*   īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥ (anādirādir govindaḥ sarvakāraṇa kāraṇam): In this verse, Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, \"I worship Lord Krishna whose form is eternal, all-knowing, and blissful. He is without beginning and end, and is the cause of all causes.\"\n\n**The Divine Form**\n--------------------\n\nHowever, in regard to the personal form of God, we must keep in mind that it is a divine form, which means it is devoid of all the defects found in material forms. The form of God is `sat-chit-ānand` — it is eternal, full of knowledge, and constituted of divine bliss.\n\n*   asyāpi deva vapuṣho mad-anugrahasya (svechchhā-mayasya na tu bhūta-mayasya ko 'pi): In this verse, Lord Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, \"O Lord, Your body is not made of pañch mahābhūta (the five great elements); it is divine. And You have descended in this form by Your own free will, to bestow Your grace upon souls like myself.\"\n\n**The Avatar**\n-----------------\n\nIn chapter four of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna stated: \"Although I am unborn, the Lord of all living entities, and have an imperishable nature, yet I appear in this world by virtue of Yogmaya, my divine power.\" This means that not only does God possess a form, but He also descends in the world as an Avatar.\n\n**The Possibility of Recognition**\n----------------------------------\n\nSince we souls have been taking births in the world from time immemorial, it is plausible that we were present in the human form on the earth when a previous descension of God was present on the earth. It is even possible that we saw the descension.\n\n**The Limitation of Material Eyes**\n-------------------------------------\n\nHowever, the limitation was that God's form was divine and we possessed material eyes. So when we saw Him with our eyes, we were unable to recognize the divinity of His personality.\n\n**The Recognition of Divinity**\n------------------------------\n\nThe divine nature of God's form is such that His divinity is perceived by each person only to the extent of his or her spiritual power.\n\n*   The divine nature of God's form is perceived by those influenced by sattva guṇa (good qualities) and they think, \"Shree Krishna is a special person. He is very competent but is definitely not God.\"\n*   When those under the spell of rajo guṇa (mixed qualities) see Him, they say, \"There is nothing special in Him. He is very much like us.\"\n*   When those dominated by tamo guṇa (bad qualities) see Him, they think, \"He is egotistic and characterless, much worse than us.\"\n*   It is only the God-realized saints who can recognize Him as God, since they have received divine vision by His grace.\n\n**The Awareness of the Unaware**\n---------------------------------\n\nAnd so, Shree Krishna says that the unaware materially conditioned souls do not know Him when He takes an avatar in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, Shree Krishna's personal form is a divine reality that transcends material limitations. Only those with spiritual power and recognition can see beyond the veil of the material world and acknowledge His divine form."

    "explanation": "**Atheistic Views of God's Personal Form**\n=============================================\n\nThere are many strands of atheistic views relating to the personal form of God that are prevalent in the world. Some people declare that God cannot descend in the world in a personal form. Consequently, they say that Shree Krishna was not God; He was merely a yogi.\n\n### Various Theories about Shree Krishna\n\nOthers say that Shree Krishna is **Māyā-viśhiṣhṭ brahma**, i.e. a lower grade of the Supreme Divinity, due to contact with the material energy. Yet others say that Shree Krishna was a characterless loafer who roamed around with the cowherd maidens of Vrindavan.\n\n**The Truth According to this Verse**\n--------------------------------------\n\nAccording to this verse, all these theories are incorrect, and the intellects of those who subscribe to them are deluded by the material energy. Shree Krishna goes to the extent of saying that those who embrace such ungodly philosophies possess demoniac natures.\n\n### Reasons for Embracing Ungodly Philosophies\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSince, they do not harbor divine sentiments toward the personal form of the Supreme Lord, they cannot engage in bhakti toward Him. And since devotion to the formless aspect of God is exceedingly difficult, they cannot do that either.\n\n### Consequences of Embracing Ungodly Philosophies\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a result, they remain bereft of the path to eternal welfare. Bewildered by the transient attractions of the material energy, their hopes for eternal well-being are in vain."

    "explanation": "**The Style of Discourse of Shree Krishna**\n=====================================================\n\nShree Krishna's style of discourse is that He drives the point home by making starkly contrasting comparisons. After describing the ways of the deluded and confused, He now talks about the great souls.\n\n**Material Life as a Prolonged Dream**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMaterial life is a prolonged dream, which is being experienced by the souls who are sleeping under the sway of the material energy. In contrast, the great souls are those who have woken up from their ignorance and brushed aside material consciousness like a bad dream.\n\n**Released from the Grips of Material Energy**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nReleased from the grips of the material energy, Maya, they are now under the shelter of the divine Yogmaya energy. Such enlightened souls have woken up to the spiritual reality of their eternal relationship with God.\n\n**The Divine Energy of Yogmaya**\n---------------------------------\n\nJust as God has both aspects to His personality—the formless and the personal form—His Yogmaya energy also possesses both aspects. It is a formless energy, but it also manifests in the personal form as Radha, Sita, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Parvati, etc.\n\n**All Divine Personalities are Manifestations of Yogmaya Energy**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll these divine personalities are manifestations of the divine energy of God, and they are all non-different from each other, just as Krishna, Ram, Shiv, Narayan, etc. are non-different forms of the one God.\n\n**Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇ**\n-------------------------\n\nThe verse quotes Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇ, which states:\n\nyathā tvaṁ rādhikā devī goloke gokule tathā\nvaikuṇṭhe cha mahālakṣhmī bhavati cha sarasvatī\nkapilasya priyā kāntā bhārate bhāratī satī\ndwāravatyāṁ mahālakṣhmī bhavatī rukmiṇī satī\ntvaṁ sītā mithilāyāṁ cha tvachchhāyā draupadī satī\nrāvaṇena hṛitā tvaṁ cha tvaṁ cha rāmasya kāminī\n\n**Quotes from the Verse**\n-------------------------\n\n\"O Radha, You are the Divine Goddess of Golok (Shree Krishna's divine Abode) and Gokul (Shree Krishna's Abode in the material realm, when He descended on earth 5,000 years ago). You exist in Vaikunth (Lord Vishnu's Abode) as Mahalakshmi. You are the consort of Lord Kapil (one of the descensions of God). You reside in Dwaraka as Rukmini (the wife of Shree Krishna). You manifested as Sita in the city of Mithila. The wife of the Pandavas, Draupadi, was like a manifestation of Your shadow. It was You who was kidnapped by Ravan in the form of Sita, and You are the wife of Lord Ram.\"\n\n**Great Souls Take Shelter of Yogmaya Energy**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna mentions that great souls take shelter of the divine energy of God. The reason is that divine grace, knowledge, love, etc. are all God's divine energies, and are all subservient to the divine Yogmaya energy.\n\n**Why Great Souls Receive Divine Grace**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHence, by the grace of Yogmaya, one receives the love, knowledge, and grace of God. Great souls, who receive divine grace, become endowed with divine love, and engage in uninterrupted devotion toward God."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Kīrtan: A Supreme Form of Devotion**\n=====================================================\n\nHaving said that the great souls engage in His devotion, Shree Krishna now explains how they do bhakti. He says that devotees become attached to **kīrtan** as a means of practicing their devotion and enhancing it. The chanting of the glories of the Lord is called **kīrtan**, which is defined as:\n\n> \"Singing glories of the Names, Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God is called **kīrtan**.\" (Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu 1.2.145)\n\n**What is Kīrtan?**\n-----------------\n\nKīrtan is one of the most powerful means of practicing devotion. It involves the three-fold devotion of **śhravaṇa** (hearing), **kīrtan** (chanting), and **smaṇa** (remembering). The goal is to fix the mind upon God, but it becomes easier when done alongside with hearing and chanting. As stated in chapter six, the mind is as restless as the wind, and naturally wanders from thought to thought. Hearing and chanting engage the knowledge senses in the divine realm, which helps in repeatedly bringing back the mind from its wanderings.\n\n**Benefits of Kīrtan**\n-------------------\n\nKīrtan has many other benefits as well.\n\n*   It drives sleep away, making it an engaging process that keeps the mind active and focused.\n*   Chanting blocks out distracting sounds from the environment, creating a conducive atmosphere for spiritual growth.\n*   Kīrtan can be practiced in groups, enabling mass participation and diversity of thought.\n*   The mind desires variety, which it gets through the medium of kīrtan in the form of the Names, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, etc. of God.\n*   The divine vibrations of the Names of God make the entire environment auspicious and holy.\n\n**History of Kīrtan**\n-----------------\n\nFor all these reasons, kīrtan has been the most popular form of devotion amongst saints in Indian history. All the famous bhakti Saints—Soordas, Tulsidas, Meerabai, Guru Nanak, Kabir, Tukaram, Ekanath, Narsi Mehta, Jayadev, Tyagaraja, and others—were great poets. They composed numerous devotional songs, and through them, they engaged in chanting, hearing, and remembering.\n\n**Vedic Scriptures and Kīrtan**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Vedic scriptures particularly extol kīrtan as the simplest and most powerful process of devotion in the present age of Kali.\n\n> \"The best process of devotion in the age of Satya was simple meditation upon God. In the age of Tretā, it was the performance of sacrifices for the pleasure of God. In the age of Dwāpar, worship of the deities was the recommended process. In the present age of Kali, it is kīrtan alone.\" (Bhagavatam 12.3.52)\n\n**Kīrtan as a Path to Salvation**\n----------------------------------\n\navikārī vā vikārī vā sarva doṣhaika bhājanaḥ\n\n> \"Whether you are full of desires or free from them, devoid of defects or full of them, if you engage in kīrtan of the names of Lord Ram, you will attain the highest destination.\" (Adhyātma Ramayan)\n\nsarva dharma bahirbhūtaḥ sarva pāparatasthathā\n\n> \"Even those who are deeply sinful and bereft of religiosity can be saved by the chanting of the names of Lord Vishnu; of this, there is no doubt.\" (Vaiśhampāyan Samhitā)\n\nkalijuga kevala hari guna gāhā, gāvata nara pāvahiṅ bhava thāhā\n\n> \"In this age of Kali, there is one means of salvation. By engaging in the chanting of the glories of God, one can cross over this material ocean.\" (Ramayan)\n\n**The Essence of Kīrtan**\n-----------------------\n\nHowever, one must remember that in the process of kīrtan, hearing and chanting are helpers. The essence is to remember God. If we leave it out, the kīrtan will not purify the mind. Thus, Shree Krishna says here that His devotees do kīrtan, while constantly engaging the mind in thinking of Him. They practice this with great determination for the purification of the mind."

    "explanation": "**9.15 Sādhaks**\n### Spiritual Practitioners Follow Different Paths to Reach the Absolute Truth\n\nSādhaks, or spiritual practitioners, follow different paths of spirituality to reach the Absolute Truth. Shree Krishna previously described those who are devotees, and they surrender themselves with devotion at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, in the attitude of being His eternal parts and servants. He now describes some of the other paths that sādhaks follow.\n\n### Paths of Sādhaks\n\n#### Jñāna Yog\nThose who follow the path of jñāna-yog consider themselves to be non-different from God. They contemplate deeply on sūtras such as:\n\n* \"So 'haṁ\" (I am That)\n* \"Śhivo 'haṁ\" (I am Shiv)\n\nTheir ultimate goal is to attain realization of the Supreme Entity as the undifferentiated Brahman, which possesses the attributes of eternality, knowledge, and bliss, but is devoid of forms, qualities, virtues, and pastimes. Shree Krishna says that such jñāna yogis also worship Him, but in His formless all-pervading aspect.\n\n#### Aṣhṭāṅg Yogis\nIn contrast, there are varieties of aṣhṭāṅg yogis who see themselves as distinct from God and relate to Him accordingly.\n\n#### Worship of the Manifest Universe\nStill others worship the manifest universe as God. In Vedic philosophy, this is called viśhwaroop upāsanā (worship of the cosmic form of God). In western philosophy, it is called \"Pantheism\" from the Greek words pan (all) and theos (God). The most famous exponent of this philosophy has been Spinoza. Since the world is a part of God, keeping a divine sentiment toward it is not wrong, but it is incomplete. Such devotees do not have knowledge of the other aspects of the Supreme Divine Entity, such as Brahman (God's undifferentiated all-pervading manifestation), Paramātmā (the Supreme Soul seated in everyone's hearts), and Bhagavān (the personal form of God).\n\n### Can All These Divergent Approaches Worship the Same God?\n\nHow can all these divergent approaches worship the same God? Shree Krishna answers this in the following verses."

The term encompasses both agnihotra (fire worship) and vaiśhva deva (other types of sacrifices).\n\n**Shree Krishna's Relationship with Creation**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Creator and Father**: Shree Krishna is the creator of the universe, and hence He is its Pitā (Father).\n*   **Mother**: Before creation, Shree Krishna holds the unmanifested material energy in His womb. Therefore, He is also its Mātā (Mother).\n*   **Sustainer**: Shree Krishna maintains the universe and nourishes it, making Him its Dhātā (Sustainer).\n*   **Grandfather of Brahma**: Shree Krishna is the Father of Brahma, who is the creator.

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Relationship with God**\n=====================================================\n\nSince the soul is a tiny part of God, its every relationship is with Him. However, in bodily consciousness, we look upon the relatives of the body as our father, mother, beloved, child, and friend. We become attached to them and repeatedly bring them to our mind, thereby getting further bound in the material illusion.\n\n**The Limitations of Worldly Attachments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nBut none of these worldly relatives can give us the perfect love that our soul yearns for. This is for two reasons:\n\n*   **Temporary Nature**: These relationships are temporary, and separation is unavoidable when either they or we depart from the world.\n*   **Selfish Attachment**: Even as long as they are alive, the attachment is based on selfishness and so it fluctuates in direct proportion to the extent by which self-interest is satisfied.\n\nThe range and intensity of worldly love varies from moment to moment, throughout the day. As we can see from our everyday experiences:\n\n> \"My wife is very nice... she is not so nice... she is ok... she is terrible,\" This is the extent of fluctuation of love in the drama of the world.\n\nOn the other hand, God is such a relative who has accompanied us lifetime after lifetime. From birth to birth, in every life-form that we went, God accompanied us and remained seated in our heart. He is thus our eternal relative.\n\n**Eternal and Selfless Love**\n-----------------------------\n\nIn addition, He has no self-interest from us; He is perfect and complete in Himself. He loves us selflessly, for He only desires our eternal welfare.\n\nThus, God alone is our perfect relative, who is both eternal and selfless.\n\n**The Analogy of the Ocean and the Waves**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTo understand this concept from another perspective, consider the analogy of an ocean and the waves that emerge from it.\n\nTwo neighboring waves in the ocean flow together for some time, and play mirthfully with each other, creating the impression that they have a very deep relationship between them.\n\nHowever, after travelling some distance, one subsides into the ocean, and shortly after, the other does the same.\n\nDid they have any relationship between themselves? No, they were both born from the ocean and their relationship was with the ocean itself.\n\nSimilarly, God is like the ocean and we are like waves who have emanated from Him. We create attachments amongst our bodily relations, only to leave everyone upon death, and journey alone into another birth.\n\n**The Truth of the Relationship**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe truth is that the souls are not related to each other, but to God, from whom they have all emanated.\n\n**The Message of Shree Krishna**\n--------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna takes us above bodily consciousness and its concomitant attachment to worldly relatives. From the platform of the soul, God alone is all our relationships; He is our Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Beloved, and Friend.\n\nThis theme is reiterated in all the Vedic scriptures:\n\n> \"Lord Narayan alone is the Mother, Father, Beloved, and destination of the soul.\"\n>\n> \"O Lord Ram, You alone are my Master, the Savior of the destitute, and the Knower of the heart.\"\n\n**Achieving Complete Surrender**\n---------------------------------\n\nKnowing the magnitude of our eternal relationship with God, we must endeavor to attach our mind to Him alone. Then, the mind will be purified and we will be able to fulfill the condition of \"māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja,\" or complete surrender, which is necessary for receiving God’s grace.\n\nTo achieve this single-mindedness, we must cut all the present attachments of the mind and replace them with attachment to God.\n\nHence, the Ramayan states:\n\n> \"Cut all the strings of worldly attachment of your mind; make a rope of these strings, and tie it at the lotus feet of God.\"\n\nTo help us tie our mind to Him, Shree Krishna here explains to Arjun that the soul’s every relationship is with God alone.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, understanding our true relationship with God is essential for spiritual growth. By recognizing the limitations of worldly attachments and the eternal nature of our relationship with God, we can achieve complete surrender and receive God’s grace."

    "explanation": "**The Puranas and the Creation of the Universe**\n\n9.19 The Puranas describe that when God first created the universe, He manifested the first-born Brahma and entrusted him with the work of further creation. Brahma was bewildered by the task of creating the materials and the life-forms in the universe from the subtle material energy.\n\n**The Revelation of Knowledge to Brahma**\n\nThen God revealed knowledge unto him, which is called the Chatuḥśhlokī Bhāgavat (the four-versed Bhagavatam), on the basis of which Brahma proceeded to create the world. Its first verse states very emphatically:\n\n\"Ahamevāsamevāgre nānyadyatsadasat param\nPaśhchādahaṁ yadetachcha yo 'vaśhiṣhyeta so 'myaham\"\n\n(Bhagavatam 2.9.32)\n\nThis verse, which translates to \"I am all that is. Prior to creation, I alone existed. Now that creation has come about, whatever is in the form of the manifested world is my very self. After dissolution, I alone will exist. There is nothing apart from Me.\"\n\n**The Truth Implied by the Verse**\n\nThe above truth implies that the material with which we worship is also God. When people venerate the holy Ganges, they immerse the lower half of their body in the river. Then, they lift water in their palms and pour it into the Ganges. In this way, they use the Ganges water itself to worship it. Similarly, when God is all that exists, then the material for worshipping Him is also non-different from Him.\n\n**The Nature of Devotion**\n\nThus, as previously stated in verses 16 and 17, Shree Krishna reveals that He is the Vedas, the sacrificial fire, the syllable \"Om\", the clarified butter, and the act of offering. No matter what the form and sentiment of our devotion, there is nothing apart from God that we can offer to Him. Nevertheless, it is the sentiment of love that pleases God, not the material of the offering.\n\n**The Significance of the Ganges**\n\nWhen we immerse ourselves in the holy Ganges and pour its water into it, we are reminded of the non-different nature of devotion. Just as the Ganges water is used to worship itself, our devotion should be directed towards God in the same way. This understanding is essential for true worship and spiritual growth.\n\n**The Essence of Devotion**\n\nIn essence, devotion should be guided by love and a genuine sense of connection with God. The material aspects of worship are mere manifestations of our devotion, and it is the sentiment of love that ultimately pleases God. By understanding this fundamental truth, we can deepen our spiritual practice and cultivate a more meaningful connection with the divine."

Then, He described the nature of great souls, who are engaged in loving devotion to Him. Now, in this verse and the next, He mentions those who are not devotees, but are not atheistic either. They perform the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas.\n\n### The Science of Trai-Vidyā\n\nThe science of karm kāṇḍ (Vedic rituals) is referred to as trai-vidyā. People who are fascinated by the science of trai-vidyā worship the celestial gods, such as Indra, through the performance of yajñas (fire sacrifices) and other rituals.\n\n### Worshiping the Supreme Lord Indirectly\n\nThey worship the Supreme Lord indirectly because they do not realize that it is He alone who sanctions the gifts that the celestial gods bestow. This means that they are essentially worshiping a manifestation of the Supreme Lord, but not recognizing Him as the ultimate reality.\n\n### Classification of Ritualistic Ceremonies\n\nRitualistic ceremonies are considered good deeds, but they are not counted as devotion. The performers of ritualistic ceremonies do not get released from the cycle of life and death.\n\n### Rewards for Ritualistic Ceremonies\n\nThe performers of ritualistic ceremonies go to the higher planes of existence within the material universe, such as abode of Indra, the king of heaven. There, they enjoy exquisite celestial delights that are thousands of times more pleasurable than the sensual pleasures available on the earth.\n\n### Critique by Shree Krishna\n\nIn the following verse, Shree Krishna points out the defect in celestial pleasures.\n\n### The Flaw in Celestial Pleasures\n\nThe flaws in celestial pleasures are that they are temporary and impermanent, just like the material world. They are not the ultimate source of happiness or fulfillment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe performance of ritualistic ceremonies can provide temporary pleasure and satisfaction, but it is not a substitute for true devotion to the Supreme Lord. True devotion brings about lasting happiness and fulfillment, whereas ritualistic ceremonies only provide temporary gratification."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Nature of Celestial Delights**\n=====================================================\n\nShree Krishna explains in this verse that the celestial delights of the heavenly abodes are temporary. After people who have been promoted there have fully enjoyed heavenly pleasures and exhausted their merits, they are sent back to the earthly plane. Thus, attaining promotion to the heavenly abodes does not fulfill the eternal quest of the soul.\n\n**The Impermanence of Celestial Delights**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWe have all been there many times in endless past lifetimes, and yet the hunger of the soul for infinite Bliss has not yet been satiated. All the Vedic scriptures support this belief:\n\n### Temporal Nature of Celestial Delights\n\ntāvat pramodate swarge yāvat puṇyaṁ samāpyate\nkṣhīṇa\n\n### The Temporary Nature of Celestial Delights\n\n“Residents of heaven enjoy the celestial delights until their merits have been exhausted. Then they are reluctantly forced to fall back to the lower abodes by the passage of time.”\nswargahu swalpa anta dukhadāī\n(Ramayan)\n\n**The Miseries that Follow Celestial Delights**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n“The attainment of heaven is temporary, and is followed by miseries.” Just as a football gets kicked all over the field, Maya is kicking the soul around in forgetfulness of God. Sometimes it goes to the lower abodes, while sometimes to the higher abodes. Amongst these multitudes of forms it receives, across the lower and higher abodes, only the human form offers the facility for God-realization.\n\n**The Human Form: A Rare Gift**\n------------------------------\n\nHence, the scriptures state that even the celestial gods pray to be given birth as a human being, so that they may rectify their previous mistake of going to heaven, and strive toward God-realization.\n\n### The Rarity of the Human Form\n\ndurlabhaṁ mānuṣhaṁ janma prārthayate tridaśhairapi\n(Nārad Purāṇ)\n\n“The human form is exceedingly rare. Even the celestial gods pray to attain it.”\n\n**The Value of Human Life**\n---------------------------\n\nThus, Lord Ram instructed the residents of Ayodhya:\n\nbaṛeñ bhāga mānuṣha tanu pāvā, sura durlabha saba granthanhi gāvā\n(Ramayan)\n\n“O people of Ayodhya, you all are extremely fortunate to have been bestowed a human birth, which is exceedingly rare and is desired even by the residents of heaven.”\n\n**The Importance of God-Realization**\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhen the celestial beings long for a human birth, then why should we humans seek promotion to the celestial abodes? Rather, we should aim for God-realization by engaging in devotion to the Supreme Lord."

God promises two things.\n\n*   **Spiritual Assets**: He bestows His devotees the spiritual assets they do not possess.\n*   **Protection of Spiritual Assets**: He protects the spiritual assets that His devotees already possess.\n\n**The Condition for God's Promise**\n\nHowever, the condition He has placed for this is exclusive surrender. This can again be understood through the same analogy of the mother and child.\n\n**The Analogy of Mother and Child**\n\nA newborn baby is fully dependent upon its mother, who takes care of the baby's welfare entirely. The baby simply cries whenever it needs anything; the mother cleans it, feeds it, bathes it, etc. But when the baby becomes a five-year old child, it begins doing some actions for itself. To that extent, the mother reduces her responsibilities. And when the same child becomes a youth and assumes all responsibilities, the mother relinquishes her responsibilities further.\n\n**The Mother's Attitude**\n\nNow if the father comes home and asks, \"Where is our son?\" The mother replies, \"He has not returned home after school. He must have gone for a movie with his friends.\" Her attitude is now more neutral toward him.\n\nBut when the same boy was a five-year old, and had gotten delayed by ten minutes in returning home from school, both the mother and father would begin worrying, \"What has happened? He is a small child. Let's hope he has not met with an accident. Let us phone the school and find out.\"\n\n**God's Law**\n\nIn this way, as the boy keeps assuming more responsibilities, his mother keeps relinquishing her responsibilities. God's law is exactly the same.\n\n*   **Independent Will**: When we act from our independent will, thinking that we are the doers of our actions, and depend upon our own prowess and abilities, God does not bestow His grace. He merely notes our karmas and gives the result.\n*   **Partial Surrender**: When we surrender partially to Him and partially depend upon material crutches, God also partially bestows His grace upon us.\n*   **Exclusive Surrender**: And when we offer ourselves exclusively to Him, māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja, God bestows His complete grace and takes full responsibility by preserving what we have and providing what we lack."

    "explanation": "**The Worship of Lower Gods for Material Gains**\n\n9.23 Having described the position of those who worship the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna now explains the situation of those who worship the lower gods for material gains.\n\n### The Situation of Those Who Worship Lower Gods\n\nThey are also endowed with faith, and they may have their supplications answered by the celestial gods, but their understanding is incomplete. They do not realize that the celestial beings receive their powers from God Himself.\n\n### Indirect Worship of the Supreme Lord\n\nHence, they also worship the Supreme Divine Personality, albeit indirectly. For example, if a government officer redresses a complaint by a citizen, he is not credited with being benevolent. He is merely utilizing the powers in his jurisdiction that have been bestowed upon him by the government.\n\nSimilarly, all the powers of the celestial gods come from the Supreme Lord. Thus, those with superior understanding do not go by the indirect route; they worship the source of all powers, which is God Himself.\n\n### The Limitations of Indirect Worship\n\nSuch worship that is offered to the Supreme Lord automatically satisfies the entire creation:\n\nyathā taror mūla-niṣhechanena\ntṛipyanti tatskandhabhujopaśhākhāḥ\nprāṇopahārāchcha yathendriyāṇāṁ\ntathaiva sarvārhaṇam achyutejyā   \n(Bhagavatam 4.31.14)\n\n\"When we water the root of a tree, its trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, and flowers all become nourished. When we put food in our mouth, it nourishes the life airs and the senses automatically.\n\nIn the same way, by worshipping the Supreme Lord, all His parts, including the devatās are also worshipped.\"\n\n### The Unfruitful Nature of Indirect Worship\n\nHowever, if we begin watering the leaves of a tree, while neglecting its roots, the tree will perish. Likewise, the worship offered to the celestial gods certainly makes its way to the Supreme Lord, but such devotees do not get spiritual benefits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is elaborated in the next verse."

By virtue of the powers bestowed upon them by the Supreme Lord, they do possess the ability to grant material favors, but they cannot liberate their devotees from the cycle of life and death.\n\n**Limitations of Celestial Gods**\n\nThey can only offer to others what they themselves possess. When the celestial gods themselves are not liberated from samsara, then how can they release their devotees from it?\n\n**The Right Understanding**\n\nOn the other hand, those whose understanding is proper offer their entire veneration at the feet of God Himself. When their devotion reaches the stage of perfection, they go beyond the world of mortals to the divine Abode.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Celestial gods cannot liberate devotees from samsara.\n* They can only offer material favors based on their own possessions.\n* Those with proper understanding worship God Himself.\n* Proper devotion leads to liberation beyond the world of mortals."

Just as water in a pipe can only rise to the level of the reservoir, devotees can only reach the destination they worship.\n\n**Implications of Worshiping Different Entities**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna explains the implications of worshiping different entities by revealing the varieties of destinations attained. He illustrates this concept by listing the destinations of those who worship various deities:\n\n### Destinations of Different worshippers\n\n*   **Indra (the rain god)**: Celestial abodes\n*   **Kuber (the god of wealth)**: Celestial abodes\n*   **Agni (the god of fire)**: Celestial abodes\n\nWhen their account of good karmas gets depleted, they are sent back from heaven.\n\n**The Role of Ancestors**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Pitars (ancestors) are also worshipped by some devotees. It is good to harbor thoughts of gratefulness toward them, but undue concern with their welfare is detrimental.\n\n### Ancestor Worship\n\n*   **Destinations after death**: The abodes of their ancestors\n*   **Positive aspect**: Gratefulness toward ancestors\n\n**Engaging in Negative Devotions**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThose who engage in such negative devotions will be punished in their next life:\n\n### Engaging in Negative Devotions\n\n*   **Destination**: Born amongst ghosts and spirits\n*   **Examples**:\n    *   Western world: Witchcraft\n    *   Africa: Black magic\n    *   India: Vām-marg tāntrics (who invoke ghosts and spirits)\n\n**Highest Devotees**\n--------------------\n\nThe highest devotees are those who attach their minds to the Supreme Divine Personality. The word vrata (resolve and undertaking) is used to describe these fortunate souls:\n\n### Characteristics of Highest Devotees\n\n*   **Attachment**: Attach their minds to the Supreme Divine Personality\n*   **Resolve and undertaking**: Firmly resolve to worship God and engage steadfastly in His devotion\n*   **Destination after death**: The divine Abode of the Supreme"

    "explanation": "**The Divine Nature of God**\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 9, Verse 26), Shree Krishna explains how easy it is to worship the Supreme. He emphasizes that God accepts anything offered with a loving heart, regardless of its material value.\n\n### Rules for Propitiating Devatās and Ancestors\n\nIn the worship of devatās (gods) and ancestors, there are many rules to follow. These rules must be strictly observed to please them.\n\n*   **Offerings**: When offering something, the key is to have a loving heart. If you only have a fruit, offer it to God.\n*   **Variety of Offerings**: If there is no fruit available, offer a flower. Even if it's not in season for flowers, an offering of a leaf will suffice.\n*   **Water as an Offering**: If leaves are scarce, make an offering of water. This is available everywhere.\n*   **Devotion**: It's essential to offer with devotion, not just the value of the offering.\n\n### The Merciful Nature of God\n\nBy making this wonderful statement, Shree Krishna reveals the merciful nature of God. He values love above everything else when making an offering.\n\n*   **Love is the Key**: The word \"bhaktyā\" has been used in both lines of this verse. It's the bhakti (love and devotion) of the devotee that pleases God, not worth.\n*   **God's Valuation**: He is not concerned with the material value of our offering. Instead, He values the love with which we make the offering.\n\n### The Wonderful Nature of God\n\nShree Krishna's statement in the Hari Bhakti Vilas (verse 11.261) highlights the wonderful nature of God.\n\n*   **Sincere Love**: If you offer God with sincere love, just a Tulsī leaf and as much water as you can hold in your palm will suffice.\n*   **Endearment by Love**: God is endeared by love, and He will offer Himself to you in return.\n\n### The Shreemad Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad Gita\n\nThe Shreemad Bhagavatam contains exactly the same verse as the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 10, Verse 81.4).\n\n*   **Offerings to God**: If one offers God with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even water, He delights in partaking of that article offered with love by His devotee in pure consciousness.\n\n### The Divine Pastimes\n\nWhenever God descends upon the earth, He exhibits this quality in His divine Pastimes.\n\n*   **Shree Krishna's Hospitality**: Before the Mahabharat war, when Shree Krishna went to Hastinapur to explore an agreement between the Kauravas and Pandavas, the evil Duryodhan proudly prepared a meal with fifty-six different items.\n*   **Vidurani's Devotion**: Despite the elaborate meal, Vidurani's intellect was benumbed with loving sentiments. She offered bananas and put the peels in Shree Krishna's mouth.\n*   **Shree Krishna's Bliss**: Seeing her devotion, Shree Krishna blissfully ate the peels as if they were the most delicious food in the world.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, Shree Krishna's words reveal the merciful nature of God. He values love above everything else when making an offering, and His divine Pastimes demonstrate this quality."

Now He says that all actions should also be offered to Him.\n\n### Key Points of Offering Our Actions\n\nWhatever social duties one may be engaged in, whatever vegetarian food one may be eating, whatever non-alcoholic beverages one may be drinking, whatever Vedic rites one may perform, whatever vows and austerities one may observe, should all be offered mentally to the Supreme Lord.\n\n**Separating Devotion from Daily Life**\n\nVery often, people separate devotion from their daily life, and look on it as something that is only to be performed inside the temple room. However, devotion is not to be restricted to the periphery of the temple room; it is to be engaged in at every moment of our life.\n\n### Bhakti Defined by Sage Narad\n\nSage Narad defines bhakti in this manner:\n\nnāradastu tadarpitā khilāchāratā tadvismaraṇe paramavyākulateti\n\n(Nārad Bhakti Darśhan,\nSūtra\n 19)\n\n\"Devotion means offering your every activity to God, and feeling intense separation if ever you lose remembrance of Him.\"\n\n### Arpaṇam: Offering Our Actions to God\n\nWhen works are dedicated and mentally delivered to God, it is called arpaṇam. Such an attitude metamorphoses the mundane activities of material life into divine service of God.\n\n**Quotes on Devotion and Work**\n\n* \"No work is secular. Everything is devotion and service.\" - Swami Vivekananda\n* \"jahañ jahaṇ chalūñ karūñ parikramā, jo jo karūñ so sevā\njaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat, jānūñ deva na dūjā\"\n\n(Wherever I walk, I feel I am circumambulating the Lord's temple; whatever I do, I see it as service to God.)\n- Saint Kabir\n\n**The Significance of Offering Our Actions**\n\n\"Whatever one does with body, words, mind, senses, and intellect, in accordance with one's individual nature, should be offered to the Supreme Lord Narayan.\"\n- Bhagavatam 11.2.36\n\nHowever, this act of offering is not to be done at the end of the work by merely reciting mantras, such as śhrī kṛṣṇāya samarpaṇam astu, etc., as is done in the Vedic rituals. It is to be done while performing the action itself, by maintaining the consciousness that we are working for the pleasure of the Lord.\n\n### Benefits of Offering Our Actions\n\nShree Krishna now lists the benefits of doing so. However, the exact benefits are not mentioned in this passage.\n\nShree Krishna states that all actions should be offered to Him. By doing so, we can transform our mundane activities into divine service of God.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOffering our actions to the Supreme Lord is a powerful way to transform our lives and deepen our devotion. By doing so, we can experience the benefits of dedicating our actions to God and remain united with Him at all times."

    "explanation": "**The Imperfections of Our Actions**\n=====================================\n\nEvery action has defects, just as fire is covered by smoke. When we walk on the earth, we unknowingly kill millions of tiny living entities. In our occupational duties, no matter how careful we are in the fulfillment of our duties, we still end up harming the environment and hurting others. Even if we eat a cup of yogurt, we still incur the sin of destroying the living entities that reside in it. Some religious sects try to reduce this involuntary killing by tying a cloth over their mouth. Even this does not fully eliminate the destruction of living entities in our breath.\n\n**The Consequences of Self-Interest**\n-----------------------------------\n\nWhen we perform our actions with the intention of fulfilling our self-interest, we are culpable for the sins we commit, knowingly or unknowingly. In accordance with the law of karma, we have to reap their karmic reactions. Good works can also be binding because they oblige the soul to go to the celestial abodes to enjoy their results. Thus, both bad and good karmas result in the continuity of the cycle of birth and death.\n\n**The Solution of Renunciation**\n-----------------------------------\n\nHowever, in this verse, Shree Krishna gives a simple solution for destroying all karmic reactions of work. He uses the word \"sanyās\", yog, meaning renunciation of selfishness. He says that when we dedicate our actions for the pleasure of the Lord, we are freed from the fetters of both good and bad results.\n\n**The Benefits of Renunciation**\n------------------------------\n\nThose who establish themselves in such consciousness are called yogyuktātmā (united in consciousness with God). Such yogis become jīvan mukt (liberated in consciousness) even in this body. And, upon leaving their mortal frame, they receive a divine body and eternal service in the divine Abode of God."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of God's Justice and Favor**\n\n9.29 We all intuitively believe that if there is a God, He must be perfectly just; there cannot be an unjust God. People suffering injustice in the world make statements such as, “Mr. Billionaire, you have the power of money on your side. Do what you like. God will settle our dispute. He is watching and will definitely punish you. You cannot escape.”\n\nThis sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just.\n\n**Doubting the Fairness of God's Favor**\n\nHowever, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it. Isn’t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality? Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by saying:\n\n**Samo’ Ham (I am Equal to All)**\n\nsamo’ ham,\nmeaning, “No, no, I am equal to all. But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.” This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: “In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.”\n\n**The Equitable Nature of God's Grace**\n\nThe rainwater falls equally upon the earth. Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.\n\nThere is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land. The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.\n\n**Applying the Principle to God's Favor**\n\nSimilarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.\n\n**Purifying the Impure Heart**\n\nSo, what can people do whose hearts are impure? Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti."

He is perfectly just, truthful, compassionate, loving, merciful, etc.\nSince we souls are His tiny parts, we are all naturally drawn to these godly qualities.\n\n### The Elusive Mystery of Virtue\n\nBut the process of becoming virtuous remains an elusive mystery.\nFrom childhood, we have heard that we must speak the truth, serve others, be free from anger, etc.\nand yet we are unable to put those teachings into practice for the simple reason that our mind is impure.\n\n### The Importance of Mind Purification\n\nWithout purification of the mind, blemishes of character cannot be eradicated fully and permanently.\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj declares the irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues:\n\nsatya ahinsā ādi mana! bina hari bhajana na pāya\njala te ghṛita nikale nahīñ, koṭina kariya upāya\n\n(Bhakti Śhatak verse 35)\n\n\"Oil stains on a cloth cannot be removed by water, no matter how much we try.\nSimilarly, truthfulness, non-violence, and other virtuous qualities cannot be acquired without engaging in devotion to God.\"\n\n### The Role of Devotion\n\nThese qualities manifest when the mind is purified; and the purification of the mind cannot take place without attaching it to the all-pure God.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Promise\n\nFurther, Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish.\nHe does not say, \"The jñānī (person of knowledge) will not be lost.\"\nNor does He say, \"The karmī (performer of rituals) shall not perish.\"\nHe makes His promise for His bhaktas (devotees), saying that \"they shall never come to ruin.\"\n\n### The Importance of Keeping Promises\n\nThereby, He reiterates what He had stated in verse 9.22, that He personally carries the burden of maintaining those who depend upon Him and engage in exclusive devotion unto Him.\n\n### The Reason for Shree Krishna's Request\n\nIt may seem intriguing why Shree Krishna asks Arjun to make this statement, instead of declaring it Himself?\nThe reason is that under special circumstances the Lord sometimes breaks His word, but He never permits His devotees' word to be broken.\n\n### The Example of Bheeshma\n\nFor example, Shree Krishna had resolved that He would not lift weapons during the Mahabharat war.\nBut when Bheeshma, considered the perfect devotee, resolved that he would either kill Arjun by sunset the next day or make the Lord lift weapons to protect him, Shree Krishna broke His own vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma.\n\n### The Significance of Keeping Promises\n\nThus, to reaffirm the strength of His statement, Shree Krishna here says, \"Arjun, you declare that My devotee will never perish, for I shall guarantee that your word will be kept.\""

Hence, all those who come to know God do so by virtue of his divine grace.\n\n**The Gift of Divine Knowledge**\n\nAs he mentions in verse 10 of this chapter: “To those whose minds are always united with me in loving devotion, I give the divine knowledge by which they can attain me.” Here, Shree Krishna says that those who know him as the Supreme Lord of all lords are not deluded. Such blessed souls become free from all reactions to their past and present actions, and develop loving devotion toward him.\n\n**The Distinction Between the Soul and Self**\n\nTo make the distinction between the souls and himself, Shree Krishna declares that he is:\n\n*   **Loka Maheśhwaram**: the great Lord of all the abodes of existence.\n*   **The Supreme Lord**: the Controller of all controllers; he is the God of all gods.\n*   **The Beloved**: He is the Beloved of all beloveds; he is the Ruler of the world, and beyond the material energy.\n\n**The Description of Shree Krishna's Nature in the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad**\n\nThe same declaration has been made in the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad:\n\ntamīśhwarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśhwaraṁ\ntaṁ devatānāṁ paramaṁ cha daivataṁ\npatiṁ patīnāṁ paramaṁ parastād\nvidāma devaṁ bhuvaneśhamīḍyam\n\n(6.7)[v3]\n\n\"The Supreme Lord is the Controller of all controllers; he is the God of all gods. He is the Beloved of all beloveds; he is the Ruler of the world, and beyond the material energy.\""

These emotions are:\n\n*   **Buddhi**: The ability to analyze things in their proper perspective.\n*   **Jñānam**: The ability to discriminate spiritual from material.\n\n### Spiritual and Material Emotions\n\nIt is essential to understand that these emotions are not just random feelings but are rather a manifestation of our connection with the divine. Lord Krishna explains that the absence of confusion is achieved through **Asammoham**.\n\n### Forgiveness and Compassion\n\nThe ability to forgive those who have harmed us is **Kṣhamā**.\n\n### The Veracity of Truth\n\nThe ability to declare the truth for the benefit of all is **Satyam**.\n\n### Restraint and Control\n\nRestraint and control of the senses from sense objects is **Dam**, while **Śham** is restraint and control of the mind.\n\n### Emotions of Joy and Sorrow\n\nThe emotion of joy and delight is **Sukham**, while the emotion of sorrow and affliction is **Duḥkham**.\n\n### Perception of Existence\n\nThe perception of one's existence \"I am\" is **Bhavaḥ**.\n\n### The Experience of Death\n\nThe experience of death is **Abhāvaḥ**.\n\n### Fear and Freedom from Fear\n\nThe fear of oncoming difficulties is **Bhaya**, while freedom from fear is **Abhaya**.\n\n### Abstinence and Equanimity\n\nAbstinence from harming any being through word, deed, or thought is **Ahinsā**, while equanimity in good and bad situations is **Samatā**.\n\n### Contentment and Austerities\n\nFeeling content in whatever comes by one's karma is **Tuṣhṭi**, while voluntary austerities for spiritual benefit are **Tapa**.\n\n### Charity and Fame\n\nGiving in charity to one who is worthy is **Dān**, while fame arising from possessing good qualities is **Yaśh**.\n\n### Infamy and Karma\n\nInfamy for possessing bad qualities is **Ayaśh**.\n\n### The Source of All Qualities\n\nShree Krishna states that all these qualities manifest in individuals to the extent sanctioned by him alone.

    "explanation": "**The Source of Everything**\n==========================\n\nHere, Shree Krishna continues explaining how he is the source of everything that exists. Previously, he mentioned twenty emotions; now, he mentions twenty-five elevated personalities. These are the seven great Sages, the four great Saints, and the fourteen Manus. He also gives a genealogical synopsis of the universe that is born of him.\n\n**The Birth of Brahma**\n--------------------\n\nBrahma was born from the **Hiraṇyagarbh** energy of Vishnu (the form of God that is responsible for administering the material creation). From Brahma were born the four great saints, who are Sanak, Sanandan, Sanat, and Sanatan. They are also called the four Kumars. In our universe, the four Kumars are the eldest children of Brahma.\n\n**Characteristics and Powers of the Four Kumars**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSince theirs was an asexual birth from the mind of their father alone, they have no mother. Being eternally liberated souls and experts in the science of Yog, they were empowered to help others attain liberation through spiritual **sādhanā**.\n\n**The Seven Sages**\n-----------------\n\nAfter the four Kumars, came the seven sages. These are:\n\n*   **Mareech**\n*   **Angira**\n*   **Atri**\n*   **Pulastya**\n*   **Pulaha**\n*   **Kratu**\n*   **Vasishtha**\n\nThey were empowered with the task of procreation of the human population.\n\n**The Fourteen Manus**\n---------------------\n\nThen come the fourteen Manus, which are:\n\n1.  **Svayambhuva**\n2.  **Swarochisha**\n3.  **Uttam**\n4.  **Tamas**\n5.  **Raivat**\n6.  **Chakshusha**\n7.  **Vaivasvat**\n8.  **Savarni**\n9.  **Dakshasavarni**\n10. **Brahmasavarni**\n11. **Dharmasavarni**\n12. **Rudra-putra**\n13. **Rochya**\n14. **Bhautyaka**\n\nThey were empowered for the administration of humankind from the celestial abodes, and for the establishment and protection of Vedic dharma.\n\n**The Current Era**\n-----------------\n\nWe are presently in the era of the seventh Manu, who is called Vaivasvat Manu. This era is thus called **Vaivasvat Manvantar**.\n\n**The Future Era**\n-----------------\n\nIn the celestial abodes, there are many **devatās** who are discharging the function of maintaining the universe. All these personalities are sons and grandsons of Brahma, who in turn was born from Lord Vishnu, who in turn is a non-different expansion of Shree Krishna.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nTherefore, we can say that Shree Krishna is the original forefather of all forefathers (**prapitāmaha**)."

    "explanation": "**The Significance of Vibhuti and Yogam**\n\n### Verse Explanation\n\n10.7 The word `vibhūti` refers to the great `śhaktis` (powers) of God manifesting in the universe. The word `yogam` refers to God’s connection with these wonderful powers.\n\n### Explaining the Concept\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna explains that when we become aware of the magnificence of the Supreme Lord and become convinced about his glory, we naturally become inclined to engage in his devotion.\n\n### The Relationship Between Knowledge and Love\n\nKnowledge of the greatness of God nourishes the love of the devotees and enhances their devotion. There is a direct relationship between knowledge and love, as the following example reveals.\n\n#### An Example\n\nLet us say that your friend shows you a black pebble-like stone. You have no knowledge of its importance, and thus, you have no love for it either.\n\n#### The Significance of Śhāligrām\n\nYour friend says, “This is a `śhāligrām`, and a saintly personality has gifted it to me.” A `śhāligrām` is a special kind of fossil stone worshipped as a representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\n#### The Impact of Knowledge\n\nIf you are aware of the significance of `śhāligrāms`, when you receive this knowledge that the stone is a `śhāligrām`, your appreciation for it will increase.\n\n#### Further Enhancement of Respect\n\nLet us say your friend further adds, “Do you know it used to be worshipped five hundred years ago by the great saint, Swami Ramananda?” The moment you hear this piece of knowledge, your respect for the stone will increase further.\n\n#### The Cycle of Knowledge and Devotion\n\nEach time, it is the knowledge that is boosting your reverence for the stone. Similarly, proper knowledge of God enhances devotion toward him.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, having described God’s majestic splendors that manifest in the wondrous workings of unlimited universes, Shree Krishna states that those who become situated in this knowledge naturally become united with him through unflinching `bhakti`."

    "explanation": "**Shree Krishna's Supreme Ultimate Truth**\n\nShree Krishna begins the verse by saying:\n\"ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo\"\n, meaning “I am the Supreme Ultimate Truth and the cause of all causes.”\n\n**Repetition in the Bhagavad Gita**\n\nHe has repeated this multiple times in the \nBhagavad Gita\n, in verses 7.7, 7.12, 10.2-3, and 15.15. It is also strongly proclaimed in all the other scriptures.\n\n**Rig Veda Statement**\n\nThe Rig Veda states:\nyaṁ kāmaye taṁ taṁ ugraṁ kṛiṣhṇomi taṁ brahmāṇaṁ taṁ riṣhiṁ taṁ sumedhsam\n(10.125.5)[v4]\n“I make the persons I love exceedingly mighty; I make them men or women; I make them wise sages; I make a soul empowered for the seat of Brahma.” The wise who comprehend this truth develop firm faith and worship him with loving devotion.\n\n**Supreme Lord of Both Creations**\n\nThus, Shree Krishna is the Supreme Lord of both the material and spiritual creations. However, administering creation is not the primary work of God.\n\n**Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Statement**\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu states:\n“Shree Krishna does not directly involve himself in the works of creating, maintaining, and dissolving the material universes.” Shree Krishna’s primary activity is to engage in eternal loving pastimes with the liberated souls in Golok, his divine abode.\n\n**Primary Activity**\n\nFor the purpose of material creation, he expands himself as Karanodakshayi Vishnu, who is also called Maha Vishnu.\n\n**Maha Vishnu**\n\nMaha Vishnu is thus the form of the Lord that presides over the material realm, consisting of infinite material universes. Maha Vishnu is also known as \nPratham Puruṣh\n (first expansion of God in the material realm). He resides in the divine water of the \nkāraṇ\n (causal) ocean and manifests innumerable material universes from the pores of his body.\n\n**Expansion of Maha Vishnu**\n\nHe then expands himself to reside at the bottom of each universe as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, who is called \nDvitīya Puruṣh\n (second expansion of God in the material realm).\n\n**Garbhodakshayi Vishnu**\n\nFrom Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Brahma is born. He guides the process of creation—creating the various gross and subtle elements of the universe, the laws of nature, the galaxies and planetary systems, the forms of life residing in them, etc.\n\n**Brahma as Secondary Creator**\n\nHowever, he is actually the secondary creator.\n\n**Kshirodakshayi Vishnu**\n\nGarbhodakshayi Vishnu further expands himself as Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, and resides at the top of each universe, in a place called \nKṣhīra Sāgar\n. Kshirodakshayi Vishnu is also known as \nTṛitīya Puruṣh\n (third expansion of God in the material realm). He resides at the top of the universe, but he also resides as the Supreme soul, in the heart of all living beings in the universe, noting their karmas, keeping an account, and giving the results at the appropriate time.\n\n**Non-Different Forms of Lord Vishnu**\n\nAll the three forms of Lord Vishnu mentioned here are non-different from Shree Krishna.\n\n**Shree Krishna as Avatārī**\n\nThus, in this verse, Shree Krishna states that all spiritual and material creation emanate from him. Shree Krishna is also called the \nAvatārī\n (the source of all the \nAvatārs\n).\n\n**Śhrīmad Bhāgvatam's Statement**\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgvatam states:\n“All the forms of God are the expansions, or the expansions of the expansions of Shree Krishna, who is the primordial form of God.” And so, the secondary creator Brahma prays to Shree Krishna:\nyasyaikaniśhvasita kālamathāvalambya\njīvanti lomavilajā jagadaṇḍanāthāḥ\nviṣhṇurmahān saihayasya kalāviśheṣho\ngovindamādi puruṣhaṁ tamahaṁ bhajāmi\n(Brahma Samhitā 5.48)[v7]\n“Infinite universes—each having Shankar, Brahma, and Vishnu—manifest from the pores of Maha Vishnu’s body when he breathes in, and again dissolve into him when he breathes out. I worship Shree Krishna of whom Maha Vishnu is an expansion.”\n\n**Worship of Shree Krishna**\n\nShree Krishna now goes on to explain how devotees worship him.\n\n**Worship Methods of Devotees**\n\nShree Krishna now goes on to explain how devotees worship him.\n\n**Verse 10.8 Explained**\n\nShree Krishna states that all spiritual and material creation emanate from him, and thus he is the Supreme Lord of both the material and spiritual creations. Shree Krishna is also called the \nAvatārī\n (the source of all the \nAvatārs\n )"

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Devotion**\n==========================\n\n### The Mind's Absorption\n\nThe nature of the mind is to become absorbed in what it likes most. Devotees of the Lord become absorbed in remembering him because they develop deep adoration for him. His devotion becomes the basis of their life, from which they derive meaning, purpose, and the strength to live. They feel it as essential to remember God as a fish feels it essential to have water.\n\n### Where the Heart Resides\n\nWhat is most dear to people’s hearts can be determined by where they dedicate their mind, body, and wealth. The Bible states: “For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.” (Matthew 6:21)[v8]. You can see where people’s hearts are by studying their checkbooks and credit card statements. If they are spending money on fancy cars, that’s where their heart is. If they are spending on luxurious holidays, that’s what is most dear to them.\n\n### The Love of Parents and Devotees\n\nThe love of parents for their children is visible in the fact that they are willing to sacrifice their time and wealth in their welfare. Likewise, the love of the devotees manifests in their dedicating themselves to God. Shree Krishna says:\n\nmad-gata-prāṇāḥ\n\nimplying, “My devotees surrender their lives to me.”\n\n### Contentment and Equanimity\n\nFrom such surrender, comes contentment. Since devotees offer the results of their activities to their beloved Lord, they see every situation as coming from him. Hence, they gladly accept both positive and negative circumstances as the will of God, and remain equipoised in both.\n\n### Displaying Devotion\n\nThe devotees’ love for God is displayed in the form of the above characteristics. They find great relish in conversing about the glories of God, and his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and devotees. In this way, by engaging in \n\nkīrtan \n(chanting) and \nshravaṇa\n (hearing) regarding the glories of God, they relish his sweetness for themselves and share it with others as well.\n\n### The Threefold Bhakti\n=====================\n\nThey contribute to one another’s progress by enlightening others about divine knowledge of God (\nbodhayanti\n). Speaking and singing about the glories of God gives the devotees great satisfaction (\ntuṣhyanti\n), and delight (\nramanti\n). In this way, they worship him through the processes of remembering, hearing, and chanting. This is the threefold \nbhakti\n comprising of \nshravaṇa, kīrtan,\n and \nsmaraṇa\n. This has previously been described in the commentary on verse 9.14.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Response\n=========================\n\nHaving described how his devotees worship him, Shree Krishna now explains how he responds to their devotional activities."

    "verseNum": "10.10",
    "explanation": "**The Limitations of Human Understanding**\n=====================================================\n\n### Divine Knowledge and Human Intellect\n\nDivine knowledge of God is not attained by the flight of our intellect. No matter how powerful a mental machine we may possess, we have to admit the fact that our intellect is made from the material energy. Hence, our thoughts, understanding, and wisdom are confined to the material realm; God and his divine realm remain entirely beyond the scope of our corporeal intellect.\n\n### Quotes from Sacred Texts\n\nThe Vedas emphatically declare:\n\n> \"Those who think they can understand God with their intellects have no understanding of God. Only those who think that he is beyond the scope of their comprehension truly understand him.\"\n> \n> Kenopaniṣhad 2.3[v9]\n\nThe Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:\n\n> \"One can never comprehend God by self-effort based upon the intellect.\"\n> \n> (3.9.26)[v10]\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\n> \"Lord Ram is beyond the scope of our intellect, mind, and words.\"\n> \n> [v11]\n\n### The Impossibility of God-Realization through Human Effort\n\nNow, if these statements on the topic of knowing God plainly declare that it is not possible to know him, how then can God-realization be possible for anyone? Shree Krishna reveals here how knowledge of God can be gained. He says that it is God who bestows divine knowledge upon the soul, and the fortunate soul who receives his grace is able to know him.\n\n### The Gift of Divine Knowledge\n\nThe Yajur Veda states:\n\n> \"Without bathing oneself in the nectar emanating from the lotus feet of God, no one can know him.\"\n> \n> [v12]\n\n### The Role of Divine Grace\n\nThus, true knowledge of God is not a result of intellectual gymnastics but a consequence of divine grace. Shree Krishna also mentions in this verse that he does not choose the recipient of his grace in a whimsical manner. Rather, he bestows it upon those who unite their minds with him in devotion.\n\n**What Happens When We Receive Divine Grace?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna talks about what happens when we receive divine grace. \n\n### The Consequences of Receiving Divine Grace\n\nWhen we receive divine grace, we are able to know God in a way that is not possible through our own efforts. The divine knowledge bestowed upon us enables us to understand the true nature of God and his relationship with us."

    "verseNum": "10.11",
    "explanation": "**Understanding Shree Krishna's Elaboration on Grace**\n\n10.11 In this verse, Shree Krishna further elaborates the concept of grace. Previously, he had explained that he bestows it upon those who lovingly absorb their minds in him and make him the paramount object of their plans, thoughts, and activities. Now, he reveals what happens when someone receives his grace. He says that he destroys the darkness in their heart with the lamp of wisdom.\n\n**What is this Lamp of Wisdom?**\n\nIgnorance is often symbolized as darkness, but what is this lamp of wisdom that God talks about? At present, our senses, mind, and intellect are all material, while God is divine. Hence, we are unable to see him, hear him, know him, or be united with him.\n\n**The Conferment of Divine Energy**\n\nWhen God bestows his grace, he confers his divine Yogmaya energy upon the soul. It is also called śhuddha sattva (divine mode of goodness), which is distinct from the sattva guṇa (mode of goodness) of Maya. When we receive that śhuddha sattva energy, our sense, mind, and intellect become divine.\n\n**The Revelation of Divine Senses**\n\nTo put it simply, by his grace, God bestows his divine senses, divine mind, and divine intellect to the soul. Equipped with these divine instruments, the soul is able to see God, hear God, know God, and be united with God.\n\n**The Vedānt Darśhan States**\n\nHence, the Vedānt Darśhan states: viśheṣhānugrahaśh cha (3.4.38)[v13] “Only by God’s grace does one gain divine knowledge.” In this way, the torchlight that Shree Krishna refers to is his divine power. By the light of God’s divine power, the darkness of the material energy is dispelled.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* The lamp of wisdom is God's divine power that destroys darkness in the heart.\n* Divine energy (Yogmaya) confers śhuddha sattva, which is distinct from Maya's sattva guṇa.\n* When we receive this divine energy, our senses, mind, and intellect become divine.\n* The Vedānt Darśhan confirms that God's grace is necessary for divine knowledge."

He asserts that all Shree Krishna has stated is factual and not any metaphorical description.\n\n**Bhagavān Defined**\n--------------------\n\nThe word \"Bhagavān\" is defined in Devī Bhāgavat Purāṇ in the following manner:\n\n\"aiśhwaryasya samagrasya dharmasya yaśhasaḥ śhriyaḥ\njñānavairāgyośhchaiva ṣaṇṇāṁ bhagavānniḥ\"\n\n**The Six Opulences of Bhagavān**\n--------------------------------\n\n**Bhagavān** is he who possesses these six opulences to the infinite extent—strength, knowledge, beauty, fame, opulence, and renunciation.\n\n**Limitation of Understanding**\n------------------------------\n\nThe devatās (celestial gods), dānavas (demons), mānavas (human beings) all have finite abilities to understand. They cannot comprehend the full identity of Bhagavān."

This is clearly logical because:\n\n*   All souls possess finite intellects.\n*   God is infinite.\n\nHence, he is beyond the reach of their intellects. This does not belittle him; rather, it exalts him.\n\n### Western Philosopher's Perspective\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe western philosopher F.A. Jacobi stated: \"God whom we could know would be no God.\" However, in this verse, Arjun states that there is after all one personality who knows God, and that is God himself.\n\nThus, Shree Krishna alone knows himself, and if he decides to grant his powers upon a soul, then that fortunate soul comes to know him as well."

He has been drinking Shree Krishna’s ambrosial nectar-like words with his ears, and he now cheers him, by saying **bhūyaḥ kathaya**, “Once more! My thirst for hearing your glories is not satiated.” That is the nature of divine nectar.

    "explanation": "**The Eternal Soul: A Discussion of Shree Krishna's Nature**\n====================================================================\n\nShree Krishna declares that he is not far from the soul—in fact, he is closer than the closest. The ātmā or eternal soul is enthroned in the etheric heart of all living beings. The Vedas state:\n\n“God is seated within our soul.” Seated inside, he grants the power of consciousness and eternality to the soul. If he were to subtract his power, our soul itself would become insentient and perish. We souls are thus eternal and sentient, not by our own power, but because the supremely sentient and eternal God is seated within, and is granting his powers to us. Hence, Shree Krishna declares that he is situated in the heart of all living beings.\n\n**The Body of God: Our Soul as the Universal Consciousness**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur soul is the body of God, who is the Soul of our soul. The Bhāgavatam states:\n\n“God is the ātmā of the ātmā (Soul of the soul) of all living beings.” In the Bhāgavatam again, when Shukadev described how the gopīs used to leave their own children to go and see baby Shree Krishna, Parikshit asked him how this was possible:\n\n“O Brahmin, all mothers are attached to their own children. How did the gopīs develop such intense attachment to Shree Krishna, which they did not even feel toward their own child?” Shukadev replied:\n\n“Please understand that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Soul of all living beings in the universe. For the benefit of humankind, he has appeared in a human form by his Yogmaya power.”\n\n**The Nature of Shree Krishna: Endless and Eternal**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna further states that he is the beginning, middle, and end of all living beings. They have emanated from him, and so he is their beginning. All life that exists in creation is sustained by his energy, and so he is the middle. And those who attain liberation go to his divine abode to live eternally with him. Hence, God is also the end of all living beings.\n\n**The Definition of God in the Vedas**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAmongst the various definitions of God given by the Vedas, one of them is:\n\n“God is he from whom all living beings have emanated; God is he within whom all living beings are situated; God is he into whom all living beings shall unite.”"

    "explanation": "**Interpretation of the Sāma Veda and Its Teachings**\n\n### Overview of the Vedas\n\nThere are four Vedas—Ṛig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda.\nAmongst these, the Sama Veda describes God's glories as they manifest in the celestial gods, who are in charge of administering the universe.\n\n**Key Teachings of the Sāma Veda**\n\n#### The Celestial Gods and Indra\n\nThe Sāma Veda is also the most musical and is sung in praise of the Lord. It is enchanting to those who understand it and it evokes devotion amongst its listeners.\n\nVasava is another name for Indra, the chief of the celestial gods. He is unparalleled among souls in fame, power, and rank.\n\nOnly a soul with many lifetimes of pious deeds is promoted to the position of Indra. Thus, Indra reflects the resplendent glories of God.\n\n#### The Relationship Between Mind and Senses\n\nThe five senses function correctly only if the mind is attentive to them. If the mind wanders away, the senses cannot function properly.\n\nFor example, you hear with your ears what people say, but if your mind wanders away while they are speaking, their words are lost to you.\n\nSo the mind is the king of the senses. Shree Krishna speaks of it as reflecting his power, and later in the Bhagavad Gita, he mentions it as the sixth and most important sense (verse 15.7).\n\n#### The Nature of Consciousness\n\nConsciousness is the quality of the soul that distinguishes it from insentient matter.\n\nThe difference between a living person and a dead person is the presence of consciousness in the living person's body and its absence in a dead person's body.\n\nConsciousness exists in the soul by the divine power of God. Hence, the Vedas state:\n\n`\"God is the sentience in the sentient.\"`\n\n— Kaṭhopaniṣhad 2.2.13 [v27]"

This perspective underscores the significance of Shankar as a fundamental aspect of Lord Shiv's nature.\n\n**The Yakshhas: Demons with a Taste for Wealth**\n\nYakshhas are semi-celestial beings that are known for their love of acquiring wealth and hoarding it. Their leader, Kuber, is the god of wealth and serves as the treasurer of the celestial gods. This characteristic reflects the vibhūti (attributes) of God amongst the demons.\n\n**The Vasus: Building Blocks of the Universe**\n\nThere are eight vasus, which represent the fundamental aspects of the universe:\n\n* Land\n* Water\n* Fire (agni)\n* Air\n* Space\n* Sun\n* Moon\n* Stars\n\nThese elements constitute the gross structure of the universe, with agni (fire) playing a crucial role in giving warmth and energy to the rest of the elements. The concept of the vasus is significant, as it highlights their interconnectedness and role in maintaining the balance of the universe.\n\n**Meru: The Celestial Mountain**\n\nMeru is a mountain in the celestial abodes, renowned for its rich natural resources. It is believed to be the axis around which many heavenly bodies rotate, making it a central component of the universe. Shree Krishna mentions Meru as his glory, highlighting its significance and divine essence.\n\n**Revelations of God's Vibhūtis**\n\nThe glories described in the text reveal the vibhūtis (attributes) of God. Just as wealth distinguishes a wealthy person, these glories demonstrate the divine power and omnipresence of Lord Shiv. By understanding and appreciating these vibhūtis, we can gain a deeper insight into the nature of the universe and our place within it."

They are the intermediaries between humans and gods, facilitating spiritual growth and enlightenment.\n\n*   **Brihaspati: The Chief Priest in Heaven**\n    *   Brihaspati is the chief priest in heaven, and as such, he holds a position of great reverence and authority. Shree Krishna refers to himself as Brihaspati, signifying his spiritual prowess and connection with the divine.\n    *   However, in verse 11.16.22 of the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, Shree Krishna states that amongst priests, he is Vashishtha. This apparent discrepancy suggests that the true importance lies not in the object (priestly status) but in the opulence of God, which manifests through various means.\n\n### The Significance of Objects as Manifestations of God's Opulence\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **Understanding the True Emphasis**\n    *   The reference to objects, such as Brihaspati and Vashishtha, should not be taken literally. Instead, their significance lies in the opulence of God that manifests through them.\n    *   This understanding is key to grasping the true essence of Shree Krishna's words, which emphasize the importance of recognizing God's presence in all aspects of life.\n*   **Applying this Understanding to Other Concepts**\n    *   The same principle should be applied when considering other roles and concepts in Hindu mythology, such as Kartikeya (Skanda) and the various bodies of water.\n    *   By recognizing the opulence of God in these objects, one can gain a deeper understanding of the spiritual themes and symbolism that underlie Hindu mythology.\n\n### Kartikeya: The Commander-in-Chief of Celestial Gods\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*   **The Son of Lord Shiv and Skanda**\n    *   Kartikeya is the son of Lord Shiv (Shiva) and is also known as Skanda. He holds a position of great power and authority, serving as the commander-in-chief of the celestial gods.\n*   **Reflecting God's Opulence**\n    *   Kartikeya embodies the opulence of God, manifesting divine power and energy. His role represents the connection between God's manifestations in various forms.\n*   **Shree Krishna's Statement on Stagnant Bodies of Water**\n    *   Shree Krishna further emphasizes his connection to the divine by stating that amongst stagnant bodies of water, he is the grave and mighty ocean.\n    *   This statement reinforces the idea that God's opulence manifests through various means, including objects and concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, Shree Krishna's verses highlight the importance of understanding God's opulence through various objects and concepts. This perspective allows for a deeper recognition of the true essence behind these references, fostering spiritual growth and enlightenment."

For the practice of ritualistic yajñas, a number of rules are applicable, all of which need to be meticulously followed. However, in japa yajña, there are no rules. It can be done anywhere and at any time, and is more purifying than the other forms of yajñas.

Dadhichi accepted the request, but desired to first go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers.\n\n### The Power of Devotion\n-------------------------\n\nIndra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisharanya, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without further loss of time.

    "explanation": "**The Purifying Power of Nature**\n\nIn nature, wind performs the work of purification very effectively. It converts impure water into water vapor; it carries away the dirty smells of the earth; it makes fire burn by fuelling it with oxygen. It is thus the great purifier of nature.\n\n**A Symbol of Power and Virtue**\n\nLord Ram was the most powerful warrior on the earth and his bow was the deadliest weapon. Yet, he never once abused his dominant superiority. Every time he utilized his weapon, it was only for good. He was thus the perfect wielder of weapons.\n\n**The Divine Avatār**\n\nRam was also an Avatār of God, and thus Shree Krishna identifies with him.\n\n**The Sacred Ganges**\n\nThe Ganges is a holy river that has its beginning from the divine feet of the Lord. It descended on earth from the celestial abodes.\n\n**The Holiness of the Ganges**\n\nMany great sages have performed austerities on its banks, adding to the holiness of its waters. Unlike normal water, if water from the Ganges is gathered in a vessel, it does not putrefy for years. This phenomenon was very pronounced earlier, but has reduced in intensity in modern times because of the millions of gallons of pollutants being poured into the Ganges."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Vidyā**\n=========================\n\nVidyā is the education that a person acquires in relation to subjects of knowledge. The scriptures describe eighteen types of vidyās, which can be categorized into several branches.\n\n**Types of Vidyā**\n-------------------\n\nAmong the eighteen types of vidyās, fourteen are prominent:\n\n*   **Angani Vedāshchatvāro Mīmānsā Nyāya Vistaraḥ**\n*   **Purāṇaṁ Dharmaśhāstraṁ Cha Vidyā Hyetāśhchaturdaśha**\n*   **Āyurvedo Dhanurvedo Gāndharvaśhchaiva Te Trayaḥ**\n*   **Arthaśhāstraṁ Chaturthaṁ Tu Vidyā Hyaṣhṭādaśhaiva Tāḥ**\n\nThese fourteen vidyās include:\n\n1.  **Vedāṅg (L limbs of the Vedas)**: These are the six types of knowledge known as Vedāṅg.\n    *   **Śhikśhā, Kalp, Vyākaraṇ, Nirukti, Jyotiṣh, Chhanda**\n2.  **Vedic Knowledge**: These are the four branches of Vedic knowledge.\n    *   **Ṛig, Yajur, Sāma, Atharva**\n3.  **Mīmānsā**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with rituals and ceremonies.\n4.  **Nyāya**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with logic and argumentation.\n5.  **Dharma Śhāstra**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with ethics and morality.\n6.  **Puranas**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with the history and mythology of ancient India.\n7.  **Āyurvedo**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with the science of medicine and health.\n8.  **Dhanurvedo**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with the science of music and poetry.\n9.  **Gāndharvaśhchaiva Te Trayaḥ**: This is a branch of knowledge that deals with the science of drama and performance.\n\n**The Significance of Vidyā**\n---------------------------\n\nPractice of these vidyās cultivates the intellect, deepens the knowledge, and increases awareness of the path of dharma. Additionally, the science of spirituality liberates human beings from material bondage and gives them immortality.\n\n**The Best Knowledge**\n--------------------\n\n\"This is the best knowledge, by which the intellect becomes attached to the lotus feet of God.\" (Verse 4.29.49)\n\n**The Science of Logic**\n-----------------------\n\nIn the field of argument and logic, jalpa means to find fault with the opponent's statements, for the sake of establishing one's own opinion. Vitaṇḍa means to avoid proper deliberation on the truth through evasion and frivolous arguments. Vāda is the logical conclusion of the discussion.\n\n**The Universal Principles of Logic**\n--------------------------------------\n\nLogic is the basis for communication of ideas and establishment of truths. It is because of a universal sense of logic that knowledge can be easily cultivated, taught, and learnt in human society. The universal principles of logic are a manifestation of the power of God.\n\n**The Importance of Logic in Human Society**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nLogic is a fundamental aspect of human communication. It enables us to understand and articulate our thoughts, and to establish common ground with others. The principles of logic are universal and transcend cultural boundaries, making them a fundamental part of human knowledge.\n\n**The Connection Between Logic and Spirituality**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nLogic is not just a rational faculty, but also a means of accessing higher states of consciousness. The science of logic reveals the underlying principles that govern reality, and provides a framework for understanding the nature of God. By cultivating logical awareness, we can deepen our spiritual practices and connect with the divine."

    "explanation": "### Understanding Sanskrit and its Unique Features\n#### The Importance of the Letter \"A\"\n\nIn Sanskrit, all letters are formed by combining a half-letter with “a.” For example,\n\nक्\n + \nअ\n = \nक\n (\nk\n + \na\n = \nka\n). Hence, the letter “a” is the most important in the Sanskrit alphabet. “A” is also the first vowel of the alphabet, and since the vowels are written before the consonants, “A” comes at the very beginning.\n\n#### The Refined Language of Sanskrit\nAlthough Sanskrit is such an ancient language, it is highly refined and sophisticated. A common procedure in Sanskrit language is to combine words to form compound words. When, in the process of making one compound word, two or more words give up their case endings, it is called \n**samāsa**\n, and the resulting word is called \n**samāsa pada**\n, or compound word. There are primarily six kinds of \n**samāsa**:\n\n1.  **dwandva**: Two words remain prominent in this type of combination.\n2.  **bahub�obili**: One word becomes more prominent than the other in this type of combination.\n3.  **karm dhāray**: This is another type of combination in Sanskrit language.\n4.  **tatpuruṣh**: This is also another type of combination in Sanskrit language.\n5.  **dwigu**: This is one more type of combination in the language.\n6.  **avyayī bhāv**: This is one more type of combination in the language.\n\nAmongst these, \n**dwandva**\nis the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word. The dual word Radha-Krishna is an example of \n**dwandva**\n. Shree Krishna highlights it as his \n**vibhūti**.\n\n### The Glorious Creativity of God\nCreation is a magnificent act and awesome to behold. Humankind’s most sophisticated and technologically advanced inventions pale in comparison. Therefore, Lord Krishna singles out the first-born Brahma, who made the entire universe, and says that amongst creators, the creative ability of Brahma best reflects the glory of God."

All life inevitably ends in death, and thus the phrase, “dead end.” God is not merely the force of creation; he is also the force of destruction. He devours everything in the form of death.\n\n**The Cycle of Life and Rebirth**\n----------------------------------\n\nIn the cycle of life and death, those who die are born again. Shree Krishna states that he is also the generating principle of all future beings.\n\n**The Virtues**\n==============\n\nIdeal qualities that make a person glorious are well-rounded virtues. *Cough* Shree Krishna lists fame, prosperity, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, courage, and forgiveness, as virtues that make women glorious. The first three of these qualities manifest on the outside, while the next four manifest on the inside.\n\n**The Seven Qualities**\n=====================\n\nBesides this, the progenitor of humankind Prajapati Daksha had twenty-four daughters. Five of these were considered the best of women—Kirti, Smriti, Medha, Dhriti, and Kshama. Shree was the daughter of Sage Bhrigu. Vak was the daughter of Brahma.\n\n**The Presiding Deities**\n=====================\n\nIn accordance with their respective names, these seven women are the presiding deities of the seven qualities mentioned in this verse.

Now he says that within the Sāma Veda, he is the Brihatsama, which has an exquisite melody. It is typically sung at midnight.\n\n### The Sanskrit Language and its Poetic Forms\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe Sanskrit language, like other languages, has distinctive systems of rhymes and meters for writing poetry. The poetry of the Vedas is in many meters. Amongst these, the Gayatri meter is very attractive and melodious.\n\n**A Famous Gayatri Mantra**\n-----------------------------\n\nA famous mantra set in this meter is the Gayatri mantra. It is also a deeply meaningful prayer:\n\n```python\nbhūrbhuvaḥ swaḥ tatsaviturvareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt \n(Rig Veda 3.62.10)[v31]\n```\n\n“We meditate upon the Lord who is illuminating the three worlds and is worthy of our worship. He is the remover of all sins and the destroyer of ignorance. May he illumine our intellects in the proper direction.”\n\n### The Gayatri Mantra in Hindu Rituals\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Gayatri mantra is a part of the sacred thread ceremony for young males, and is recited as a part of the daily rituals. The Devi Gayatri, the Rudra Gayatri, the Brahma Gayatri, the Paramhansa Gayatri, and several other Gayatri mantras are also found in the Vedas.\n\n**The Margsheersh Month**\n------------------------\n\nMargsheersh is the ninth month of the Hindu calendar. It falls in November-December. The temperature at that time in India is just right—neither too hot nor too cold. The crops in the field are harvested at this time of the year. For these reasons it is often the favorite month of the people.\n\n### Basant (Spring Season)\n-------------------------\n\nBasant, or spring season, is known as **ṛitu rāja**, or the king of seasons. It is a time when nature seems to be euphorically bursting forth with life. Many festivals are celebrated in spring, epitomizing the joy that pervades the atmosphere. Thus, amongst the seasons, spring manifests God’s opulence the most."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Virtue and Vice**\n=====================================\n\nShree Krishna mentions not only virtue but also vice as his opulence. Gambling is a dangerous vice that ruins families, businesses, and lives. It was Yudhishthir’s weakness for gambling that led to the Mahabharat war. But if gambling is also God’s glory, then is there no harm in it, and why is it forbidden?\n\n**The Freedom of Choice**\n-------------------------\n\nThe answer is that God grants his power to the soul, and along with it, he gives the freedom of choice. If we choose to forget him, he gives us the power to forget.\n\n> This concept can be compared to electric power. Just like how an electric power can be used both to heat and cool a house, the soul has the freedom to choose how it utilizes its gifts from God.\n\n**Responsibility and Misuse**\n---------------------------\n\nThe user is free to choose how to utilize the power. However, the powerhouse that supplies the energy is not responsible for either the use or misuse of the power. Similarly, a gambler too possesses intellect and ability that is supplied by God.\n\n> But if he decides to misuse these God-given gifts, then God is not responsible for the sinful deeds.\n\n**The Power of Determination**\n-----------------------------\n\nEveryone likes victory; it reveals the glory of the Lord. Also, Shree Krishna has laid great emphasis on the quality of determination.\n\n> It was previously mentioned in verse 2.41, 2.44, and 9.30 as well.\n\n**The Nature of Virtues**\n-------------------------\n\nThe goodness of the virtuous is also a manifestation of God’s power. All virtues, achievements, glory, victory, and firm resolve originate from God.\n\n> Instead of considering these as our own, we should see them as coming from him."

Since no soul can excel the Lord, he is naturally the most glorious personality of the Vrishni dynasty. The Pandavas were the five sons of Pandu—Yudhishthir, Bheem, Arjun, Nakul, and Sahadev. Amongst them, Arjun was an archer par-excellence, and was a very intimate devotee of Shree Krishna. He looked upon the Lord as his dear friend.\n\n### Ved Vyas: The Sage of Revelation\n\nVed Vyas is special amongst the sages. He is also known by the names “Badarayan” and “Krishna Dwaipayan.” He revealed Vedic knowledge in various ways and wrote many scriptures for the welfare of the people. In fact, Ved Vyas was an Avatār (incarnation) of Shree Krishna himself and is mentioned in the list of Avatārs in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam.\n\n### Shukracharya: The Sage of Ethics\n\nShukracharya was a very learned sage known for his expertise in the science of ethics. He was compassionate to accept the demons as his disciples and guide their progress.

    "explanation": "**The Power of Punishment**\n\n### A Tool for Reforming Behavior\n\nHuman nature is such that mere sermons are not sufficient for ensuring good behavior amongst people. Punishment, when meted out in a timely and just manner, is an important tool for reforming sinful behavior in people and training them in right conduct. One of its goals is meant to deter those in society that might be inclined to perform wrong actions.\n\n### The Science Behind Proper Punishment and Reward\n\nModern management theory describes very nicely how even one minute of proper punishment for wrong actions and one minute of suitable reward for good actions can rectify people’s behaviors.\n\n**The Universal Desire for Victory**\n\n### A Victor's Moral Compass\n\nThe desire for victory is universal, but those with the strength of character are not willing to sacrifice morals or ethics to achieve it. That victory which is won by the path of righteousness signifies the power of God.\n\n**Secrecy and Silence**\n\n### The Value of Keeping Secrets\n\nA secret is that which is hidden from public knowledge for a specific purpose. There is a saying in English, “A secret known to one person is a secret; a secret known to two people is no longer a secret; and a secret known to three people is news shouted out to the rest of the world.” Thus, the greatest secret is that which is hidden in silence.\n\n**The Gift of True Wisdom**\n\n### The Maturing of Spiritual Knowledge\n\nTrue wisdom comes to a person with the maturing of spiritual knowledge through self or God realization. A person endowed with it develops the perspective of seeing all events, persons, and objects in the light of their relationship with God.\n\n### The Benefits of True Wisdom\n\nSuch wisdom purifies, fulfills, satisfies, and elevates one. It gives direction to life, the strength to cope with its vicissitudes, and determination to persevere till the end is reached.\n\n**The Essence of True Wisdom**\n\n### A Message from Shree Krishna\n\nShree Krishna says that he is such wisdom that manifests in the wise. This wisdom provides a powerful framework for living a virtuous life, free from the constraints of worldly desires and ambitions."

He is the \"eternal seed\" and \"generating seed\", emphasizing his origin of everything.\n*   **Material Cause**: This aspect highlights Shree Krishna's role as the material from which creation happens.

He now says that he has spoken only one portion (`uddeśhataḥ`) of the breadth of the topic (`vistāraḥ`).\n\n**Mentioning Opulences: A Response to Arjun's Question**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe question can be asked that if everything is the opulence of God, then what was the need of mentioning these? The answer is that Arjun had asked Shree Krishna how he should think of him, and these glories have been described in response to Arjun’s question.\n\n**The Mind's Natural Tendency**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe mind is naturally drawn to specialties, and thus, the Lord has revealed these specialties amongst his powers. Whenever we see a special splendor manifesting anywhere, if we look on it as God’s glory, then our mind will naturally be transported to him.\n\n**The Broader Perspective**\n---------------------------\n\nIn the larger scheme of things, however, since God’s glories are in all things big and small, one can think of the whole world as providing innumerable examples for enhancing our devotion. A paint company in India would advertise, “Whenever you see colors think of us.” In this case, Shree Krishna’s statement is tantamount to saying, “Wherever you see a manifestation of glory, think of me.”\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nShree Krishna's statement can be understood as a reminder to always look for God's glory in all aspects of life, whether big or small. By making this connection, we can cultivate our devotion and strengthen our bond with the Lord."

Now, of his own accord, he wants to tell something remarkable. Having revealed many amazing aspects of his splendor, he says that the magnitude of his glory cannot be judged even from the sum total of what he has described, for the entire creation of unlimited universes is held within a fraction of his being.\n\n**Why Does He Make a Reference to a Fraction of His Being?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe reason is that the entire material creation consisting of unlimited universes is only one-fourth of God's entire manifestation; the remaining three-fourths is the spiritual creation.\n\n### The Purush Sūktam Mantra\n\nThe reference to a fraction of his being can be found in the Purush Sūktam Mantra 3:\n\npādo ’sya viśhwā bhūtāni tripādasyāmṛitaṁ divi\n(Puruṣh Sūktam Mantra 3)\n\nThis mantra states:\n\n\"The temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of the Supreme Divine Personality. The other three parts are his eternal abodes that are beyond the phenomenon of life and death.\"\n\n### Shree Krishna's Remarkable Statement\n\nInterestingly, Shree Krishna is in front of Arjun, within the world, yet he reveals that the entire world is within a fraction of his being. This is like the story of Ganesh and Lord Shiv.\n\n### The Story of Ganesh and Lord Shiv\n\nOnce, Sage Narad gave Lord Shiv a very special fruit. Lord Shiv's two children, Kartikeya and Ganesh both began demanding the fruit from him. Lord Shiv thought that if he would give it to any one of them, the other would think that their father was biased. So Lord Shiv announced a competition for his two children.\n\n**The Competition**\n-------------------\n\nWhoever circumambulated the entire universe and came back to him first would get the fruit. On hearing this, Kartikeya immediately started off to circumambulate the universe.\n\n**Ganesh's Intelligent Approach**\n------------------------------\n\nIn comparison, Ganesh had a plump body and felt he was handicapped in competing with his brother. So, Ganesh decided to make up for it by using his intellect.\n\n**Ganesh's Brilliant Strategy**\n-----------------------------\n\nLord Shiv and Parvati were standing there. Ganesh circumambulated them thrice, and then announced, \"Father, I have done it. Please give me the fruit.\" Lord Shiv, \"But how have you gone around the universe? You have been with us all the while.\" Ganesh said, \"Father, you are God. The entire universe exists within you. If I have gone around you, I have gone around the entire universe.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nJust as Lord Shiv was standing in one place, and yet the entire world was contained in him, similarly, Shree Krishna announces to Arjun that the entire creation, consisting of unlimited material universes, is held within a fraction of his being."

His divine form is not visible to their material eyes. This is why souls in this material world cannot recognize God when he takes an Avatār.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Message**\n=========================\n\nAs mentioned in the ninth chapter, verse 11: \"When I descend in My personal form, deluded persons are unable to recognize Me. They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.\"\n\n**The Cosmic Form**\n==================\n\nThe same theory applies to his cosmic form. In the previous two verses, Shree Krishna asked Arjun to see the cosmic form, but Arjun could see nothing because he had material eyes. The physical eyes are insufficient to see that universal form, and the ordinary intellect is unequipped to comprehend it.\n\n**Granting Divine Vision**\n=========================\n\nThus, Shree Krishna now says that he will grant the divine vision with which it will become possible to behold the universal form with all its majesty.\n\n**The Act of Grace**\n==================\n\nThe granting of spiritual vision is an act of grace by the Supreme Lord. By his grace, God adds his divine eyes to the soul's material eyes; he adds his divine mind to the soul's material mind; he adds his divine intellect to the soul's material intellect."

The Supreme Lord had hidden his mystic opulences and was playing the role of a little child for the pleasure of his devotees. Thinking of Shree Krishna as her son, Yashoda chastised him severely one day, for eating mud despite her constant admonitions, and asked him to open his mouth so that she may see what was in it. However, to her immense wonder, when Shree Krishna opened his mouth, he revealed within it a vision of his cosmic form by his Yogmaya power.\n\n**A Marvel to Behold**\n\nYashoda was bewildered to see such unlimited wonders in the mouth of her little child.

    "explanation": "**The Universal Form of God**\n\nThe concept of the universal form of God is a central theme in Hindu mythology. This idea, which appears in various ancient scriptures, describes the Supreme Entity as having multiple heads, eyes, and feet. This manifestation is often symbolized by a thousand arms and legs.\n\n### Verses from Ancient Scriptures\n\nThe Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:\n\n`sahasraśhīrṣhā puruṣhaḥ sahasrākṣhaḥ sahasrapāt\nsa bhūmiṁ viśhwato vṛitvātyatiṣhṭhaddaśhāṅgulam \n(3.14)[v5]`\n\nTranslation:\n\"The Supreme Entity has thousands of heads, thousands of eyes, and thousands of feet. He envelopes the universe, but is transcendental to it. He resides in all humans, about ten fingers above the navel, in the lotus of the heart.\"\n\n### The Significance of Fear and Awe\n\nThe Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:\n\n`bhayādasyāgnistapati bhayāt tapati sūryaḥ\nbhayādindraśhcha vāyuśhcha mṛityurdhāvati pañchamaḥ \n(2.3.3)[v6]`\n\nTranslation:\n\"It is from the fear of God that the fire burns and the sun shines. It is out of fear of him that the wind blows and Indra causes the rain to fall. Even Yamraj, the god of death, trembles before him.\"\n\n**Interpretation and Implications**\n\nThese verses highlight the universal form of God as a symbol of transcendence and omnipresence. The idea that God is present in all humans, often described as being above the navel or in the \"lotus of the heart,\" underscores the notion that God is all-pervading and yet distinct from the physical world.\n\nThe mention of fear as a motivator for human behavior, whether it be the fire burning in the heart or Indra causing rain to fall, implies that God's presence is a driving force behind the workings of the universe. This notion is reinforced by the character of Yamraj, who trembles before God, further emphasizing the idea that even the god of death is subject to the power and awe-inspiring presence of God.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe universal form of God is a profound concept in Hindu mythology, symbolizing the Supreme Entity's transcendence and omnipresence. The verses from ancient scriptures illustrate this idea, highlighting God's presence in all humans and the motivating force behind human behavior. The notion that even the most powerful beings, such as Indra and Yamraj, tremble before God underscores the awe-inspiring presence of the Divine."

    "explanation": "**The Cosmic Form of God: Arjun's Relationship with Shree Krishna**\n\nSeeing the cosmic form of God changed the nature of Arjun's relationship with Shree Krishna. Earlier, he had looked upon him as an intimate friend and interacted in a manner befitting a close associate. He was aware in the back of his head that Shree Krishna was God, but the love overflowing in his heart would make him forget the almighty aspect of Shree Krishna's personality. All he would remember was that he loved his friend Shree Krishna more than anything in the world.\n\n**The Nature of Love**\n\nThat is the nature of love. It absorbs the mind so deeply that the devotee forgets the formal position of his Beloved Lord. And if formality is retained, then love is unable to manifest in its fullness. For example, a wife loves her husband deeply. Though he may be the governor of the state, the wife only looks upon him as her husband, and that is how she is able to interact intimately with him. If she keeps this knowledge in her head that her husband is the governor, then each time he comes by, she will be inclined to stand on her feet and pay a more ceremonial respect for him. So, the knowledge of the official position of the beloved gets immersed in the loving sentiments. The same phenomenon takes place in devotion to God.\n\n**The Cowherds of Braj**\n\nThe cowherds of Braj merely viewed Shree Krishna as their bosom buddy. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj describes their pastimes with Shree Krishna very sweetly:\n\ndekho dekho rī, gwāla bālana yārī \nrijhavata khela jitāya sakhana ko, ghoṛā bani bani banawārī\n(Prem Ras Madirā, Rasiyā Mādhuri, Pada 7)[v7]\n“Look at the sweetness of the loving interactions between Shree Krishna and his cowherd friends! They play games together, and when Shree Krishna loses the game, he becomes a horse by sitting on all fours and his friend rides on his back.” If the cowherd friends remembered that Shree Krishna was God, they would never have the gumption to do such a thing. And the Lord too relishes the intimacy of such interactions with his devotees in which they relate with him as a dear friend.\n\n**The Goverdhan Leela**\n\nShree Krishna enacted the famous Goverdhan leela pastime upon the earth, in which he lifted the Goverdhan Hill on the little finger of his left hand, to protect the residents of the land of Braj from the rain caused by Indra, the king of heaven and the celestial god of rain. However, Krishna's little cowherd associates were not impressed. In their eyes, Krishna was merely a loveable friend, and so they did not believe he could lift the hill. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states in continuation to the verse above:\n\nnakha dhāryo goverdhana-giri jaba, sakhana kahyo hama giridhārī \n(Prem Ras Madirā, Rasiyā Mādhurī, Pada 7)[v8]\n“When Shree Krishna lifted the Goverdhan Hill, his cowherd friends applied their sticks to the bottom of the hill, thinking that they were the actual lifters of the hill.” At the end, Indra accepted defeat and came seated on his white elephant. He apologized for having sent the torrential rain, without realizing Shree Krishna's supreme position.\n\n**The Realization of the Cowherds**\n\nNow, when the cowherd boys saw Indra, the King of heaven, coming and offering obeisance to their friend Krishna, they realized that Krishna is God. So, they began looking at him fearfully from a distance. Seeing their devotional sentiment change from friendship to awe and reverence, Shree Krishna lamented, “That loving exchange we were enjoying has vanished. They are now thinking I am God.” So by his Yogmaya power, he made them forget the significance of what they had seen, and they again felt that Shree Krishna was nothing more than their friend.\n\n**Arjun's Devotion**\n\nArjun was also a devotee of Shree Krishna in sakhyabhāv. He was used to relating to Shree Krishna as his friend. That is why he had agreed to having Shree Krishna as his chariot driver. If his devotion had been motivated by the fact that Shree Krishna was the Supreme Lord of all creation, Arjun would never have allowed him to do such a demeaning service. But now, seeing his infinite splendor and inconceivable opulences, his fraternal sentiment toward Shree Krishna was replaced by fear."

This fear causes Arjun to question his relationship with the Lord, making him seek mercy.\n\n**A Cry for Mercy**\n------------------\n\nSo he asks for mercy.

However, Bheeshma supported Duryodhan despite knowing of his evil nature and usurping the Pandavas' rights.\n\nAs a result, Bheeshma was destined to die in this war of goodness versus evil. His prayer to the Lord, when he lay on the bed of arrows at the end of his life, is recorded in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam:\n\n**\"Let my mind meditate upon Arjun's dear pal, Shree Krishna, who obeyed his friend's command to drive the chariot to the center of the two armies, and while there, he shortened the lifespan of the opposing generals by his mere glance.\"**\n\nBheeshma was aware that fighting against Shree Krishna would lead to death.\n\n### Dronacharya\n\nDronacharya was the guru of martial arts for both the Kauravas and Pandavas.

    "explanation": "# The Teeth of God: A Cosmic Perspective\n====================================================\n\n## Introduction to the Concept\n---------------------------\n\nIn the context of Hindu mythology, particularly in the epic poem Mahabharata, the \"teeth of God\" refer to the force of destruction that grinds everyone to death with the passage of time. This concept is exemplified in a verse from the American poet H.W. Longfellow, which reads:\n\n\"Though the mills of God grind slowly,\nYet they grind exceeding small;\nThough with patience he stands waiting,\nWith exactness grinds he all\"\n\nThis verse highlights the idea that even with patience and time, God's force of destruction is relentless and will ultimately grind everything to a fine powder.\n\n## The Bhagavad Gita's Vision of the Future\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun sees the great Kaurava generals—Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Karn—and many of the Pandava generals rushing headlong into the mouth of the Lord. He beholds the imminent future in the cosmic form of God, where the past, present, and future are visible within him in the present.\n\n## Bheeshma's Fate\n----------------\n\nBheeshma, the grandsire of both the Kauravas and the Pandavas, was the son of Shantanu and Ganga. To facilitate his father's wish for remarriage, Bheeshma renounced his right to the throne and took a lifelong vow of celibacy. However, he continued to support Duryodhan despite knowing that he was evil and usurping the right of the Pandavas. Thus, Bheeshma's actions sealed his fate.\n\nAs described in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, Bheeshma's prayer to the Lord when he lay on the bed of arrows at the end of his life reads:\n\n\"sapadi sakhi-vacho niśhamya madhye nija-parayor balayo rathaṁ niveśhya\nsthitavati para-sainikāyur akṣhṇā hṛitavati pārtha-sakhe ratir mamāstu\"\n\nTranslated, this means:\n\n\"Let my mind meditate upon Arjun's dear pal, Shree Krishna, who obeyed his friend's command to drive the chariot to the center of the two armies, and while there, he shortened the lifespan of the opposing generals by his mere glance.\"\n\nThis verse highlights Bheeshma's awareness that fighting against Shree Krishna would lead to his own demise.\n\n## Dronacharya's Fate\n------------------\n\nDronacharya, the guru of martial arts for both the Kauravas and the Pandavas, taught more about military science to Arjun than even to his son Ashwatthama. However, he felt obliged to help Duryodhan due to financial dependencies on him. Thus, Dronacharya's fate is sealed.\n\n## Karn's Fate\n-------------\n\nKarn, the bosom friend of Duryodhan and a skilled warrior, fought from the side of the Kauravas. Despite knowing that he was actually the eldest son of Kunti and brother to the Pandavas, Karn asked Shree Krishna not to disclose this secret to Yudhisthir. This request was likely made in the hope that it would stop him from being targeted by Yudhisthir.\n\n## Conclusion\n-------------\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of God's \"teeth\" serves as a reminder that even with patience and time, destruction is inevitable. The fates of Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Karn are sealed due to their actions and choices. Their stories serve as a cautionary tale about the consequences of opposing the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna and his divine will."

There were many noble kings and warriors in the war, who fought as their duty and laid down their lives on the battlefield.\n\n**The River Waves**\n-----------------\n\nArjun compares these noble warriors to river waves willingly merging into the ocean. Just as the river waves submit to the vastness of the ocean, these warriors surrender their lives to the inevitability of death.\n\n**The Moths**\n-------------\n\nOn the other hand, there were also many others who fought out of greed and self-interest. Arjun compares these warriors with moths being lured ignorantly into the incinerating fire.\n\n**The Paradox of War**\n----------------------\n\nBut in both cases, they are marching rapidly toward their imminent death. This stark reality serves as a stark reminder of the senseless violence that often accompanies human conflict.\n\n**Conclusion**\n==============\n\nArjun's comparison emphasizes the futility of war, highlighting both the noble and self-serving motivations that drive human beings into combat.

It will determine when the great personalities like Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Karn will meet their end.\n\n**The Scope of Time's Power**\n\nIt will destroy the enemy army arrayed on the battlefield even without Arjun's participating in the fight, because the Lord wants it to happen as a part of his grand scheme for the world.\n\n**Questioning the Need for Arjun's Fight**\n\nIf the warriors are already as good as dead, then why should Arjun fight?

Jayadrath had the boon that whoever caused his head to fall on the ground would instantly have his own head burst into pieces. Karn had a special weapon called “Śhakti” given to him by Indra, which would slay anyone against whom it was used. But it could only be used once, and so Karn had kept it to take vengeance on Arjun. Dronacharya had received the knowledge of all weapons and how to neutralize them from Parshuram, who was an Avatār of God. Bheeshma had a boon that he would only die when he chose to do so. And yet, if God wished them to die in the battle, then nothing could save them.\n\n### The Power of God\n\nThere is a saying:\nvindhya na īndhana pāiye, sāgara juḍai na nīra\nparai upas kuber ghara, jyoṅ vipakṣha raghubīra \n[v11]\n\"If Lord Ram decides to be against you, then you may live in the Vindhyachal forest, but you will not be able to get firewood to light a fire; you may be by the side of the ocean, but water will be scarce for your usage; and you may live in the house of Kuber, the god of wealth, but you will not have enough to eat.\" Thus, even the biggest arrangements for security cannot avert a person’s death if God has willed it to happen.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Plan\n\nSimilarly, Shree Krishna says that he has already decided the outcome, but he wishes Arjun to be the medium to accomplish it and receive the glory of the conquest as a reward for his agency. Just as devotees wish to glorify God, it is God’s nature to glorify his devotees. Hence, Shree Krishna does not wish the credit to come to him; he wishes people to say after the war, \"Arjun fought so valiantly that he secured victory for the Pandavas.\"\n\n### Encouragement from the Guru\n\nIn spiritual life too, aspirants often become discouraged when they find themselves incapable of removing the defects of anger, greed, envy, lust, pride, etc. Their Guru then encourages them, “Do not be dejected. Fight and you will conquer the enemies of your mind because God wants you to succeed. Your effort will be instrumental, while God will fashion your victory by his grace.\"\n\n### Arjun's Reaction\n\nWhat was Arjun’s reaction upon hearing the Lord’s call to action?

As a token of his pleasure, Indra had placed a dazzling crown on his head.\n\n**Interpretation by Sanjay**\nIn this verse, Sanjay refers to the crown on Arjun’s head. But a crown is also the symbol of monarchy, and Sanjay deliberately uses the word to hint to the old king Dhritarasthra that his sons, the Kauravas, will lose the throne to the Pandavas in the impending war.\n\n**Symbolism of the Crown**\nThe crown serves as a potent symbol with multiple meanings. On one hand, it represents Arjun's divine right to rule as a great warrior and hero. On the other hand, it signifies royalty and power, which is being subtly hinted at by Sanjay to emphasize the inevitability of the Pandavas' victory.\n\n**Connotation in the Context**\nSanjay's deliberate use of the term \"crown\" conveys a sense of inevitability and fate. The crown, which was initially a symbol of Arjun's greatness and Indra's pleasure, now becomes a metaphor for the Pandavas' victory over their cousins, the Kauravas. This subtle hint at the outcome of the war underscores the idea that the Pandavas are destined to emerge victorious."

The reasons are as follows:\n\n### Why Should All Living Beings Bow to the Supreme Lord?\n\nArjun questions, \"why should they not?\" Why shouldn't all living beings offer their humble respects to the Supreme Lord, when:\n\n* The entire creation emanates from him,\n* Is sustained by him,\n* Shall merge back into him.\n\nHe explains that the Supreme Lord is everything that is manifest in creation because it is all his energy. He is also everything that remains unmanifest because it is his latent energy.\n\n### The Supreme Lord Beyond Manifest and Unmanifest\n\nHe highlights that the Supreme Lord is beyond both the manifest and the unmanifest because he is:\n\n* The source of all energies,\n* The Supreme Master of all energies.\n\nHence, neither the material energy nor the souls can ever do anything to impact his personality, which is transcendental to both.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Superiority over Brahma\n\nArjun specifically mentions that Shree Krishna is greater than the secondary creator Brahma because:\n\n* Brahma is the senior most in the universe,\n* All living beings are either Brahma's progeny, or the descendants of his progeny.\n\nHowever, Brahma himself was born from a lotus that grew from the navel of Lord Vishnu, who is an expansion of Shree Krishna. Thus, while Brahma is considered as the senior most grandsire of the world, Shree Krishna is Brahma's Grandsire.\n\n### The Logic Behind Brahma's Humble Respects\n\nIt is thus apt that Brahma should bow to him. The logic behind this behavior is rooted in the supremacy of Shree Krishna, who is the ultimate source and Supreme Master of all energies."

However, Shree Krishna is not the expansion of any personality. He is the causeless first cause of everything that exists.\n\n**The Supreme Lord's Attributes**\n\nAccording to the Brahma Samhitā (5.1), Shree Krishna is described as:\n\n### Parama Shivara Kritisha Naadik Vignah\nAnādirādi Govindaḥ Sarva Kāraṇa Kāraṇam\n\n**Translation:**\n\n\"The Supreme Lord is the ultimate reality. His personality is full of knowledge and Bliss. He is the origin of all, but he is without origin. He is the cause of all causes.\"\n\nShree Krishna is omniscient—the knower of everything.

While interacting with Shree Krishna—playing, eating, jesting, talking, and resting—he did not show the respect that is appropriate toward the Supreme Almighty.\n\n**The Nature of Intimate Relationships**\n\nHowever, no one minds transgressions when they are made because of a high level of intimacy shared with the other person. No government officer has the privilege to joke with the President of a country.\n\n**A Closer Look at Intimate Friendships**\n\nYet, the President’s personal friend, teases him, jests with him, and even scolds him. The President does not mind, rather he values that jest of an intimate friend more than all the respect he receives from his subordinate officers.\n\n**The Depth of Love and Devotion**\n\nThousands of people salute an army general, but they are not as dear to his heart as his wife, who sits intimately by his side. Similarly, Arjun’s intimate dealings with Shree Krishna were not transgressions; they were gestures of the depth of his loving devotion in the sentiment of being a friend.\n\n**A Humble Devotee**\n\nYet, a devotee is by nature humble, and so, out of humility, he feels that he may have committed transgressions, and hence he is asking for forgiveness.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn the context of devotion, it's essential to understand that intimacy and love can transcend traditional boundaries and expectations. Arjun's actions, although seemingly transgressive, were motivated by his deep love and devotion to Shree Krishna. His humility and recognition of potential transgressions demonstrate the complexity of human nature and the nuances of devotion."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Bhakti**\n======================\n\nBhakti is the essence of devotion in Hinduism. It refers to two distinct forms of devotion: *aiśhwarya* and *mādhurya*. In this explanation, we will delve into the characteristics of both forms and explore their examples.\n\n### Aiśhwarya Bhakti\n\nAiśhwarya bhakti is that form of devotion where the devotee is motivated to engage in devotion by contemplating upon the almighty aspect of God. The dominant sentiment in this devotion is one of awe and reverence. In such devotion, the feeling of remoteness from God and the need for maintaining propriety of conduct is always perceived.\n\n#### Examples of Aiśhwarya Bhakti\n\nThe residents of Dwaraka and the residents of Ayodhya are examples of aiśhwarya bhakti. These places worshipped Shree Krishna and Lord Ram, respectively, as their kings. Ordinary citizens in these places are highly respectful and obedient towards their king, although they never feel intimate with him.\n\n### Mādhurya Bhakti\n\nMādhurya bhakti is that form of devotion where the devotee feels an intimate personal relationship with God. The dominant sentiment in such devotion is \"Shree Krishna is mine and I am his.\" Examples of mādhurya bhakti include the cowherd boys of Vrindavan who loved Krishna as their friend, Yashoda and Nand baba who loved Krishna as their child, and the *gopīs* who loved him as their beloved.\n\n#### Why Mādhurya Bhakti is Sweeter\n\nMādhurya bhakti is infinitely sweeter than aiśhwarya bhakti. According to Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj, \"The divine bliss of God is immensely sweet in all his forms. Yet, there is a gradation in it—the bliss of his Dwaraka pastimes is sweet, the bliss of his Mathura pastimes is sweeter, and the bliss of his Braj pastimes is the sweetest.\"\n\n### Types of Mādhurya Bhakti\n\nIn mādhurya bhakti, devotees establish four kinds of relationships with Shree Krishna:\n\n*   *Dāsya Bhāv*: Shree Krishna is our Master and I am his servant. The devotion of Shree Krishna's personal servants, such as Raktak and Patrak, was in *dāsya bhāv*.\n*   *Sakhya Bhāv*: Shree Krishna is our Friend and I am his intimate companion. The devotion of the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, such as Shreedama and Madhumangal, was in *sakhya bhāv*.\n*   *Vātsalya Bhāv*: Shree Krishna is our Child and I am his parent. The devotion of Yashoda and Nand baba was in *vātsalya bhāv*.\n*   *Mādhurya Bhāv*: Shree Krishna is our Beloved and I am his lover. The devotion of the *gopīs* of Vrindavan was in *mādhurya bhāv*.\n\n**Arjun's Devotion**\n\nArjun, a devotee of *sakhya bhāv*, relishes a fraternal relationship with the Lord. However, when he saw the universal form of God, he experienced tremendous awe and reverence. Yet, he longed for the sweetness of *sakhya bhāv* that he was used to savoring. Hence, he prays to Shree Krishna to hide the almighty form that he is now seeing and again show his human form."

Arjun has realized that Shree Krishna is much more than merely his friend. His divine personality encompasses unlimited universes. Yet, he is not attracted by the infinite opulences and is not interested in doing **aiśhwarya** (**devotion**) of God Almighty. Rather, he prefers seeing that Almighty Lord in the human form, so that he can relate to him as before, like a friend.\n\n**Request for the Four-Armed Form**\n---------------------------------\n\nAddressing Lord Krishna as **sahasra-bāho** (**thousand-armed one**), Arjuna is now specifically requesting to see the **chatur-bhuj rūp** (**four-armed form**) of Lord Krishna.\n\n**Historical Context**\n---------------------\n\nIn the four-armed form, Shree Krishna appeared before Arjun on another occasion as well. When Arjun tied Ashwatthama, the killer of the five sons of Draupadi and brought him before her, at that time Shree Krishna revealed himself in his four-armed form.\n\n**The Four-Armed Form of Lord Krishna**\n---------------------------------------\n\nAs Arjun requested Shree Krishna to manifest in his four-armed form, he was also confirming that the four-armed form of the Lord is non-different from his two-armed form.\n\n**Quote**\n---------\n\nniśhamya bhīma-gaditaṁ draupadyāśh cha chatur-bhujaḥ\nālokya vadanaṁ sakhyur idam āha hasanniva \n(Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.7.52)\n**\"The four-armed Shree Krishna heard the statements of Bheem, Draupadi, and others.

He had bestowed a vision of his universal form by his grace, not as a form of punishment, but because he was very pleased with Arjun.\n\n#### Rationale Behind Shree Krishna's Action\nHe uses hyperbole as a figure of speech to stress how rare it is to see the universal form, by saying that Arjun is the first one to see it. Although Duryodhan and Yashoda were also given a glimpse of the universal form, it was not to this intensity, depth, and magnitude.\n\n#### The Divine Vision - A Gift from Shree Krishna\nShree Krishna bestowed this divine vision upon Arjun with the help of his **Yogmaya** energy. This is the divine all-powerful energy of God.\n\n### Key Points About Yogmaya Energy\n*   It is referred to in various places, such as verses 4.6 and 7.25.\n*   It is by virtue of this **Yogmaya** energy that God can perform the impossible and contradictory at the same time.\n    *   This divine power of God also manifests in the personal form and is worshipped in the Hindu tradition as the Divine Mother of the universe.\n    *   It is manifested in various forms, such as Radha, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Sita, Parvati, etc."

    "explanation": "**The Cosmic Form of God: A Vision Beyond Material Limits**\n\n11.48 Shree Krishna declares that no amount of self-effort—the study of the Vedic texts, performance of ritualistic ceremonies, undertaking of severe austerities, abstinence from food, or generous acts of charity—is sufficient to bestow a vision of the cosmic form of God. This is only possible by his divine grace. This has been repeatedly stated in the Vedas as well:\n\n\n### tasya no hrāsva tasya no dhehi \n(\nYajur Veda\n)[v24]\n\n\n### “Without being anointed in the nectar of the grace of the Supreme Lord, nobody can see him.”\n\n\n#### The Logic Behind This Vision\n\nThe logic behind this is very straightforward. Our physical eyes are made from matter, and hence all that we can see is also material. The Supreme Lord is non-material—he is divine. To have a vision of his divine form we need divine eyes. When God bestows his grace upon the soul, he adds his divine power to our material eyes, and only then can we see him.\n\n#### The Role of Divine Eyes\n\nOne may ask that how was Sanjay also able to see that cosmic form, which Arjun saw by divine grace. The Mahabharat states that Sanjay also received by the grace of his Guru, Ved Vyas, who was an Avatār (incarnation) of God.\n\n#### The Story of Sanjay and Arjun\n\nBefore the war, Ved Vyas offered his student Sanjay divine vision so that he may be able to communicate the details of the war to Dhritarashtra. Hence, he saw the same cosmic form that Arjun saw. But later, when Duryodhan died, Sanjay was overwhelmed with grief and lost his divine vision.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the cosmic form of God is a vision that transcends material limits. It requires divine eyes and the grace of the Supreme Lord to behold its majesty. This is a reminder that true understanding and perception can only be achieved through the blessings of God."

    "explanation": "**The Cosmic Form of Shree Krishna**\n=====================================\n\nShree Krishna hid the vision of his cosmic form, and manifested before Arjun in his four-armed form, which is adorned with a golden diadem, disc, mace, and lotus flower. It is the repository of all divine opulences such as majesty, omniscience, omnipotence, etc.\n\n**The Sentiment of Awe and Reverence**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe four-armed form of Shree Krishna evokes the sentiment of awe and reverence, much like the sentiments of the citizens of a kingdom toward their king. However, Arjun was a **sakhā** (friend) of Shree Krishna, and devotion dominated by the sentiment of awe and reverence would never satisfy him.\n\n**The Sweetness of Sakhya Bhāv**\n-------------------------------\n\nSuch blissful devotion of **sakhya bhāv** (devotion where God is seen as a personal friend) is infinitely sweeter than **aiśhwarya bhakti** (devotion where God is revered as the distant and almighty Lord). Hence, to conform to Arjun's sentiment of devotion, Shree Krishna finally hid even his four-armed form, and transformed into his original two-armed form.\n\n**A Return to the Two-Armed Form**\n-----------------------------------\n\nOnce in the forest of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna was engaging in loving pastimes with the **gopīs**, when he suddenly disappeared from their midst. The **gopīs** prayed for him to come back. Hearing their supplications, he manifested again, but in his four-armed form.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Vishnu**\n-------------------------\n\nThe **gopīs** thought him to be the Supreme Lord Vishnu, and accordingly they paid their obeisance. But they moved on, not being attracted to spend any further time with him. They had been habituated to seeing the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna as their soul-beloved, and this form of his as Lord Vishnu held no attraction for them.\n\n**The Love for Radharani**\n------------------------\n\nHowever, Radharani came onto the scene, and upon seeing her, Shree Krishna became overwhelmed in love for her, and could no longer maintain his four-armed form. His two arms automatically disappeared and he resumed his two-armed form.\n\n**A Return to the Most Attractive Form**\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse too, Shree Krishna returned to his most attractive two-armed form."

    "explanation": "**The Characteristics of Exclusive Devotion**\n======================================================\n\nAt the end of the ninth chapter, Shree Krishna had told Arjun to fix his mind upon him and be devoted to him. To enhance that devotion, he wished to reveal further secrets about himself, which he did in the tenth and eleventh chapters. In the previous verse, he again emphasized the supremacy of the path of devotion. Now, he concludes this chapter by highlighting five characteristics of those who are engaged in exclusive devotion.\n\n### 1. Performing all duties for my sake\n\n*   They perform all their duties with the intention of pleasing God.\n*   \"I perform my actions with the intention that they may be acceptable to Him.\"\n\n    - **Saint Kabir**\n        ```\n[ v31 ]\njahañ jahañ chalūñ karūñ parikramā, jo jo karūñ so sevā\njaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat, jānūñ deva na dūjā \n```\n\n    When I walk, I think I am circumambulating the Lord; when I work, I think I am serving the Lord; and when I sleep, I think I am offering him obeisance. In this manner, I perform no activity other than that which is offered to Him.\n\n### 2. Dependence upon me\n\n*   Exclusive devotees do not rely on their own spiritual practices or devotion to attain God.\n*   Instead, they understand that God's grace is the sole means of attaining Him.\n\n    - **Saint Kabir**\n        ```\nWhen I walk, I think I am circumambulating the Lord; when I work, I think I am serving the Lord; and when I sleep, I think I am offering him obeisance. In this manner, I perform no activity other than that which is offered to him.”\n```\n\n### 3. Devotion to me\n\n*   Exclusive devotees do not require other spiritual practices, such as the study of Sanikhya or the practice of aṣhṭāṅg yog.\n*   Rather, they focus solely on their relationship with God and behold Him as pervading all objects and personalities.\n\n### 4. Freedom from attachment\n\n*   Devotion requires engagement of the mind, which is only possible if the mind is detached from the world.\n*   As a result, exclusive devotees are free from all worldly attachments and repose their mind in God alone.\n\n### 5. Lack of malice toward all beings\n\n*   Exclusive devotees do not harbor malice towards others, even those who have harmed them.\n*   Instead, they understand that God resides in the heart of all beings and see all actions as stemming from Him.\n\n    - **Saint Kabir**\n        ```\njahañ jahañ chalūñ karūñ parikramā, jo jo karūñ so sevā\njaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat, jānūñ deva na dūjā \n```\n\n    When I walk, I think I am circumambulating the Lord; when I work, I think I am serving the Lord; and when I sleep, I think I am offering him obeisance. In this manner, I perform no activity other than that which is offered to him.\n\n    - **Saint Kabir**\n        ```\njahañ jahañ chalūñ karūñ parikramā, jo jo karūñ so sevā\njaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat, jānūñ deva na dūjā \n```\n\n    When I walk, I think I am circumambulating the Lord; when I work, I think I am serving the Lord; and when I sleep, I think I am offering him obeisance. In this manner, I perform no activity other than that which is offered to him.\n\n    They depend upon me.\n Those who rely upon their spiritual practices to reach God are not exclusively dependent upon him. That is because he is attained by his grace, and not by spiritual practice. His exclusive devotees do not even rely upon their devotion as a means of attaining him. Rather, they place their entire faith his grace alone, and see their devotion as merely a way of attracting divine grace.\nThey are devoted to me.\n The devotees do not feel the need for performing any of the other spiritual practices, such as cultivation of the knowledge of \nSānkhya\n, practice of \naṣhṭāṅg\n\n\nyog\n, performance of fire sacrifices, etc. In this way, they feel that their relationship is with God alone. They behold only their Beloved Lord pervading all objects and personalities.\nThey are free of attachment.\n Devotion requires the engagement of the mind. This is only possible if the mind is detached from the world. So exclusive devotees are free from all worldly attachments and repose their mind in God alone.\nThey are without malice toward all beings.\n If the heart fills up with malice, it will again not remain exclusive toward God. Thus, exclusive devotees do not harbor any malice, even toward those who have harmed them. Instead, thinking that God resides in the heart of all beings, they see all actions as stemming from him and so they forgive even their wrongdoers."

    "explanation": "**The Cosmic Form of God**\n\n### Arjun's Curiosity\n\nIn the last chapter, Arjun saw the cosmic form of the Lord, which encompasses the entire universe. Having seen it, he preferred to behold God in His personal form, with Attributes, Qualities, and Pastimes. So, he is now curious regarding who are more perfect—the devotees who worship the personal form of God or those who worship the impersonal Brahman.\n\n### A Question of Perfection\n\nArjun's question once again confirms that God has both aspects—the all-pervading formless Brahman and the personal form. Those who say that God cannot possess a personal form limit Him, and those who say that God only exists in a personal form also limit Him.\n\n### The Paradox of God's Form\n\nGod is perfect and complete, and so He is both formless and possessing forms. We individual souls too have both aspects to our personality. The soul is formless, and yet it has taken on a!, not once, but innumerable times, in countless past lifetimes.\n\n### Can God Possess a Form?\n\nIf we tiny souls have the ability to possess a form, can the all-powerful God not possess a form whenever He wishes?\n\n### Advice from Jagadguru Shankaracharya\n\nEven the great proponent of the path of jñāna-yoga, Jagadguru Shankaracharya, stated:\n\n> \"mūrtaṁ chaivāmūrtaṁ dwe eva brahmaṇo rūpe, ityupaniṣhat tayorvā dwau\n> bhaktau bhagavadupadiṣhṭau, kleṣhādakleśhādwā muktisyāderatayormadhye\"\n\n> \"The Supreme entity is both personal and impersonal.

But the path of worshipping the formless is very difficult.\"\n\n### The Path to Formless Worship\n\nPractitioners of the spiritual path are also of two kinds—devotees of the formless Brahman, and devotees of the personal form. However, the path of worshipping the formless is very difficult and requires a strong devotion and commitment to practice."

    "explanation": "# Realizing God\nIn various degrees of closeness, one can realize God. To understand this concept better, let's consider an example.\n\n## An Example: The Train\nImagine standing by the railway tracks as a train approaches from a distance, with its headlight shining. From far away, it appears as if a light is approaching.\n\n**Initial Stage**\nAs the train gets closer, you notice a shimmering form along with the light. You can't quite see what it is, but you sense its presence.\n\n**Closer Realization**\nFinally, when the train stands on the platform in front of you, you realize, \"Oh! It's a train. I can see all these people sitting inside their compartments and peeping out of their windows.\"\n\n**Similarity with Realizing God**\nJust like the train, which seemed like a light from far but revealed its full form when it came closer, God can be realized in varying degrees of closeness. He is perfect and complete, possessing unlimited energies and a rich personality.\n\n## The Three Aspects of God\nThe concept of realizing God in different levels can be understood through three aspects:\n\n### 1. Brahman\nBrahman is the formless, all-pervading manifestation of God.\n\n*   **Quality:** Brahman represents the infinite and eternal aspects of God.\n*   **Example:** Water, steam, and ice are all made from the same substance (H2O), but their physical qualities differ.\n\n### 2. Paramātmā\nParamātmā is the aspect of God seated in every living being's heart.\n\n*   **Quality:** Paramātmā notes and remembers our thoughts, actions, and deeds since birth.\n*   **Example:** Shree Krishna states that God dwells in the hearts of all living beings, directing their wanderings according to their karma.\n\n### 3. Bhagavān\nBhagavān is the personal manifestation of God, descending upon earth for the welfare of the world.\n\n*   **Quality:** Bhagavān manifests God's infinite qualities, personal beauty, and sweet pastimes.\n*   **Example:** Shree Krishna descended upon earth in His personal form, revealing all the sweetness of His Names, Forms, Qualities, Abodes, Pastimes, and Associates.\n\n## Realization of God\nThe path to realizing God can be understood through various yogas:\n\n### 1. Jñāna-yog\nThis path involves realizing God as a formless light, similar to the train appearing like light from far but revealing its full form when it comes closer.\n\n*   **Example:** Those who follow the path of jñāna-yog worship the formless aspect of God.\n\n### 2. Aṣhṭāṅg-yog\nThis path aims to realize God seated inside, leading to the realization of Paramātmā.\n\n*   **Example:** The path of aṣhṭāṅg-yog strives to realize God seated inside and leads to the realization of Paramātmā.\n\n### 3. Bhakti-yog\nThis path leads to the realization of God in His personal form, which is Bhagavān.\n\n*   **Example:** The path of bhakti-yog leads to the realization of God in His personal form.\n\nIn conclusion, realizing God can be achieved through various yogas and aspects. The path of devotion leads to the realization of God in His Bhagavān aspect, which is the closest realization of God."

By understanding these differences and appreciating the diversity of God's manifestations, we can deepen our devotion and connection with the Supreme Being."

He surmises the worship of the impersonal Brahman by saying that it is an exceedingly challenging path that is full of tribulations.\n\n**Why is the Worship of the Formless Brahman so Difficult?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first and foremost reason for this is that we humans possess a form ourselves and we have been habituated to interacting with forms in endless lifetimes. Thus, while striving to love God as well, if our mind has a wonderful enchanting form to meditate upon, it can easily focus upon it and increase its attachment to the Lord.\n\nHowever, in the case of the formless, the intellect cannot conceive of it, and the mind and senses have no tangible object to relate to. Therefore, both the endeavors of meditating on God and increasing the mind’s attachment to Him become difficult.\n\n**Another Reason for the Difficulty in Worshiping Brahman**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWorship of Brahman is also difficult in comparison to that of Bhagavān for another reason. The difference in paths can be understood through the markaṭ-kiśhore nyāya (the logic of the baby monkey) and mārjār-kiśhore nyāya (the logic of the baby kitten).\n\n**The Logic of the Baby Monkey and Kitten**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   The baby monkey is responsible for holding onto her mother’s stomach; it is not helped by its mother.\n*   When the mother monkey jumps from one branch to another, the onus of clinging tightly onto the mother is upon the baby, and if it is unable to do so, it falls.\n*   In contrast, a kitten is very small and delicate, but the mother takes the responsibility of transporting it from one place to another, by holding the kitten from behind the neck and lifting it up.\n\n**Comparing Devotees of Brahman to the Baby Monkey**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThose who worship the formless Brahman have the onus of progressing on the path by themselves, because Brahman does not bestow grace upon them. Brahman is not only formless, it is also without attributes. It has been described as nirguṇa (without qualities), Nirviśheṣh (without attributes), and Nirākār (without form). From this, it follows that Brahman does not manifest the quality of grace.\n\n**The Responsibility of Self-Effort**\n---------------------------------------\n\n*   The jñānīs who worship God as nirguṇa, Nirviśheṣh, and Nirākār have to rely entirely upon self-effort for progress.\n*   On the other hand, the personal form of God is an ocean of compassion and mercy. Hence, devotees of the personal form receive the help of divine support in their sādhanā.\n*   On the basis of the protection that God bestows upon His devotees, Shree Krishna stated in verse 9.31: “O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that no devotee of Mine is ever lost.” He confirms the same statement in the next two verses."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Surrendering the Intellect to God**\n===========================================================\n\nShree Krishna explains that in order to worship Him properly, one must fix the mind on God and surrender the intellect to Him. This is crucial because the function of the mind is to create desires, attractions, and aversions, while the function of the intellect is to think, analyze, and discriminate.\n\n### The Importance of the Mind\n\nAccording to the Vedic scriptures:\n\n*   \"Captivity in Maya and liberation from it is determined by the mind. If it is attached to the world, one is in bondage, and if the mind is detached from the world, one gets liberated.\" (Bhagavatam 3.25.15)\n*   \"Bondage and liberation are decided by the state of the mind.\" (Pañchadaśhī)\n\nThe mind plays a crucial role in our spiritual growth. Mere physical devotion is not sufficient; we must absorb the mind in thinking of God.\n\n**The Limitations of Physical Devotion**\n\nPhysical devotion is not enough because without engaging the mind, mere sensory activity is of no value. For example, we hear a sermon with our ears, but if the mind wanders off, we will not know what was said.\n\nOn the other hand, the mind is an instrument that experiences all perceptions even without the gross senses. For instance, at night when we sleep our senses are inactive. Yet while dreaming, our mind experiences the objects of all the senses.\n\n**The Role of the Intellect**\n\nBeyond the mind is the intellect. We can only fix the mind upon God when we surrender our intellect to Him.\n\nIn material pursuits, when we face situations beyond the capability of our intellect, we take guidance from a person with superior intellect. For example, we visit a doctor when we are sick and surrender our intellect to follow the doctor's prescription.\n\nSimilarly, if we are involved in a legal case, we take the help of a lawyer and surrender our intellect to follow their instructions.\n\n**The Defects of the Intellect**\n\nOur intellect is subject to many defects, which are mentioned in the Bhagavatam (10.40.25):\n\n*   \"Our intellect is strapped with wrong knowledge.\"\n\nWe think of ourselves as perishable bodies when, in reality, we are eternal souls.\n\nWe accumulate worldly possessions day and night, thinking they will always remain with us, despite their impermanence.\n\nWe chase sensual pleasures in the hope of finding happiness, when they only result in misery in the long run.\n\n**The Gravity of Our Problem**\n\nThese defects of the intellect are called \"viparyaya,\" or reversals of knowledge under material illusion. The gravity of our problem is further aggravated because our intellect is habituated to this kind of defective thinking from innumerable previous lifetimes.\n\nIf we run our lives in accordance with the directions of our intellect, we will definitely not make much progress on the divine path.\n\n**The Solution: Surrendering the Intellect**\n\nTo achieve spiritual success, we must surrender our intellect to God and follow His directions. Surrendering the intellect means thinking in accordance with the knowledge received from God via the medium of scriptures and bonafide Gurus.\n\nThe characteristics of a surrendered intellect are described in verse 18.62."

    "explanation": "**The Perfection of Sādhanā**\n=====================================\n\nFixing the mind upon Shree Krishna is considered the perfection of sādhanā (spiritual practice). However, immediately on beginning the path, we cannot expect to become perfect. So, what should those people do, who cannot perfectly fix their mind on God?\n\n**A Diversion from the Path**\n---------------------------\n\nShree Krishna states here that they should endeavor to remember Him with devotion. As the saying goes, “Practice makes perfect.” This is called abhyāsa yog, or \"union with God through repeated practice.\"\n\n**The Power of Abhyāsa Yog**\n---------------------------\n\nEach time the mind wanders toward other objects and ideas, the devotee must strive to bring it back to God through remembrance of His Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates.\n\n**Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj's Instructions**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj emphasizes this repeated practice in his instructions for sādhaks:\n\njagata te mana ko haṭā kara, lagā hari meñ pyāre\nisī kā abhyāsa puni puni, karu nirantara pyāre   \n(Sādhanā Karu Pyāre)\n\n**A Call to Devotion**\n-------------------------\n\n“O dear one, remove the mind from the world and fix it on God. Practice this constantly, again and again!”\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n-------------------\n\n*   Fixing the mind upon Shree Krishna is the perfection of sādhanā.\n*   Remembering Him with devotion is the key to making progress on the spiritual path.\n*   Abhyāsa yog (union with God through repeated practice) is essential for spiritual growth.\n*   Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj's instructions emphasize the importance of repetition and devotion in sādhanā."

    "explanation": "**The Challenge of Remembering God**\n=====================================\n\n12.10 The instruction to practice remembering God is also often easier said than done. The mind is made from the material energy Maya and it naturally runs toward the material objects of the world, while taking it toward God requires conscious and determined effort. We may hear the instruction that we should think of God, and we may desire to implement it, but when we get absorbed in our work, God slips out of the mind. So what should those people do who find it difficult to practice the remembrance of God at all times of the day? Shree Krishna answers this question in the above verse.\n\n**A Practical Solution**\n------------------------\n\nThose who cannot constantly remember God should practice to simply work for Him. In whatever work they perform, they should cultivate the intention that they are doing it for the pleasure of the Lord, as stated previously in verses 9.27 and 9.28.\n\n**Applying This to Daily Life**\n-----------------------------\n\nIn household life, a major portion of one’s time goes in the maintenance of the family. One should keep doing the same work, but change the internal consciousness.\n\n### Internal Consciousness in Daily Activities\n\n*   Instead of doing it out of bodily attachment for them, one should develop the consciousness that the family members are all children of God, and one has a responsibility to take care of them for His pleasure.\n*   One has to continue earning one’s living, but again, a modification can be done in the consciousness with which one works.\n\n### Modifying Our Mindset\n\n*   Rather than thinking that it is for the purpose of earning money for worldly enjoyment, one can think, “I wish to maintain my family and myself with the earnings to enable us all to engage in devotion.”\n*   And whatever I can save, I will donate in the service of God.\n\n**The Importance of Bodily Functions**\n----------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, the bodily processes of eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. cannot be given up. But here again, we can develop divine consciousness.\n\n### Divining Consciousness in Bodily Functions\n\n*   “I need to keep my body healthy so that I can serve God with it. That is why I will carefully do the tasks required for its maintenance.”\n\n**The Power of Devotional Service**\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhen we practice working for the pleasure of God, we will naturally stop engaging in selfish activities and move toward those that are more in the nature of devotional service. In this way, by performing all actions for the exclusive satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna, our mind will become steady and we will soon be able to focus upon Him. Then, gradually love for God will manifest within the heart, and we will gain success in constantly thinking of Him."

However, that also requires a purified and resolute intellect.\n\n### Difficulty in Working for God's Pleasure\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThose who are not yet convinced about their relationship with God, and have not yet made God-realization the goal of their lives, may find it impossible to work for His pleasure.\n\n### Fourth Alternative for Welfare\n-----------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna now gives the fourth alternative for welfare. He says, “Arjun keep doing your works as before, but become detached from the fruits of your actions.”\n\n### Benefits of Detachment\n-------------------------\n\nSuch detachment will purify our mind from the modes of ignorance (tamas) and passion (rajas), and bring it to the mode of goodness (sattva). In this way, renouncing the fruits of our efforts will help remove worldliness from our mind and strengthen the intellect.\n\n### Advantages of Detachment\n-----------------------------\n\nThen, the purified intellect will more easily be able to comprehend transcendental knowledge, and we will be able to move to the higher levels of sādhanā."

    "explanation": "**Mechanical Practice of Devotion**\n=====================================\n\nMany people are at the level of mechanical practice. They perform the rituals enjoined by their religious creed, but do not engage their mind in God. When they purchase a new house or a new car, they call the Pundit to perform the pūjā (worship) ceremony. And while the Pundit performs the pūjā, they sit and talk in the other room or sip a cup of tea. For them, devotion is nothing more than performing the empty ritual.\n\n**Empty Rituals**\n----------------\n\nFor these individuals, devotion is often performed by way of ceremonial habits that have been passed on from parents and elders. Performing rituals mechanically is not a bad thing, for after all, something is better than nothing. At least such people are externally engaging in devotion.\n\n**Higher Than Mechanical Practice**\n-----------------------------------\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna says that higher than mechanical practice is the cultivation of spiritual knowledge. Knowledge bestows the understanding that the goal of life is God-realization and not material progress.\n\n**The Cultivation of Knowledge**\n------------------------------\n\nOne who is versed in knowledge goes beyond the empty rituals and develops the desire to purify the mind. But mere knowledge by itself cannot cleanse the heart.\n\n**Higher Than Knowledge**\n----------------------\n\nAnd thus, Shree Krishna says that higher than the cultivation of knowledge is the process of engaging the mind in meditation. By practically controlling the mind through meditation, we begin to develop detachment from worldly pleasures.\n\n**The Process of Meditation**\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen the mind develops some measure of the quality of detachment, we can then practice the next step, which is renunciation of the fruits of actions. As explained in the previous verse, this will help remove worldliness from the mind and strengthen the intellect for the subsequent higher stages."

The devotees realize that all living beings are tiny parts of God.\n\n*   If they harbor envy toward others, it is tantamount to harboring envy toward God Himself. So the devotees are free from malice even toward those who are inimical toward them.\n\n### Friendly and Compassionate\n\nFriendly and compassionate. Devotion engenders the feeling of unity amongst all living beings by virtue of their being children of the one God.\n\n*   The notion of seeing others as alien to oneself is wiped out.

The biggest enemy of devotion is pride.\n\n*   One can only progress on the spiritual path if one practices self-effacement. Proficient devotees naturally become humble and eliminate pride and proprietorship from their personality, as well as the false identification of being the body.\n\n### Equipoised in Happiness and Distress\n\nEquipoised in happiness and distress. Devotees have faith that only efforts are in their hands, while the results are in the hands of God.\n\n*   So whatever results come their way, they see them as the will of God, and accept them with equanimity.\n\n### Ever Forgiving\n\nEver forgiving. Devotees never think of punishing wrongdoers for their emotional satisfaction.\n\n*   Harboring such negative thoughts toward others ruins one’s own devotion. So accomplished devotees refuse to harbor unforgiving thoughts in all circumstances and leave the task of punishing wrongdoers upon God.\n\n### Ever Contented\n\nEver contented.

This absorption is not occasional or intermittent, but steady and constant because they are established in their relationship with God.\n\n### Self-Controlled\n\nSelf-controlled. Devotees attach their mind to God in loving devotion.\n\n*   It is thus detached from the world, and this gives them mastery over their mind and senses.\n\n### Firm in Conviction\n\nFirm in conviction. The quality of determination comes from possessing a resolute intellect.\n\n*   Since devotees tie their intellect to the knowledge of the scriptures and the instructions of the Guru, it becomes so resolute that even if the whole world tries to convince them otherwise, they do not budge an inch from their position.\n\n### Dedicated to Me in Mind and Intellect\n\nDedicated to Me in mind and intellect. The soul is a servant of God by its inherent nature, and as we become enlightened with this knowledge, we naturally dedicate ourselves to the Supreme Lord.\n\n*   In this surrender, the mind and intellect are of primary importance.

To a very poor person, the loss or gain of $100 would be an important matter, but a multi-billionaire would consider it insignificant and not give any further thought to it.

Hence, you are superior.\" Sudhanva again asked, \"In that case, will you obey my instruction?\"\n\n**Prahlad's Agreement**\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" responded Prahlad. \"Ok, then leave Virochan,\" said Sudhanva.\n\n**The Celestial Gods**\n\nThe celestial gods showered flowers into his court and hailed the quality of justice that Prahlad displayed.\n\n**The Nature of Devotees**\n\nThis attitude of justice came naturally to Prahlad because by virtue of being a perfect devotee of the Lord he was equal to friend, foe, relative, kith, kin, and outsider.\n\n### Equipoised in Favorable and Unfavorable Circumstances\n\nShree Krishna further mentions that the devotees are equipoised in favorable and unfavorable circumstances. They know that none of these are permanent.\n\n**An Incident from Ramakrishna Paramahansa's Life**\n\nHe got cancer of the throat in his old age. People asked him to pray to Mother Kali to cure him. He said, \"My mind is absorbed in love for Mother Kali. Why should I take it off from her and apply it to this dirty bodily cancer?\" Whatever God has willed, let it happen.\n\n### Free from Unfavorable Association\n\nAssociating with persons or objects is called saṅg. There are two kinds of saṅg. Association that takes our mind to the world is kusaṅg (unfavorable association), and that which takes our mind away from the world and toward God is called satsaṅg (favorable association).\n\n**Devotees Avoid Unfavorable Association**\n\nSince devotees do not relish worldly thoughts, they naturally avoid kusaṅg and engage in satsaṅg.\n\n### Take Praise and Reproach Alike\n\nFor those who are externally motivated, the appreciation and rejection by others is all-important. However, devotees are internally motivated by the principles they value within themselves.\n\n**Neither Commendation nor Denunciation Makes a Difference**\n\nHence, neither commendation nor denunciation by others makes any difference to them.\n\n### Given to Silent Contemplation\n\nCrows and swans have diametrically opposite choices. While crows are drawn to garbage piles, the majestic swans are attracted by tranquil lakes.\n\n**The Minds of Worldly People**\n\nSimilarly, the minds of worldly people find great relish in conversing about materialistic topics. But the saintly devotees possess pure minds, and thus worldly talks seem as attractive to them as a pile of garbage.\n\n### Content with Whatever Comes Their Way\n\nThe needs of the devotees shrink to the bare necessities for maintaining the body.\n\n**An Incident from Saint Kabir's Life**\n\nSaint Kabir expresses this in his famous couplet:\n\n\"O Lord, give me just enough for the bare maintenance of my family's bodily needs, and for giving alms to the sadhu who comes to my door.\"\n\n### Without Attachment to the Place of Residence\n\nNo earthly home can be a permanent residence for the soul, for it must necessarily be left behind at the time of death.\n\n**The Mogul Emperor Akbar's Statement**\n\nWhen the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, built his capital, Fatehpur Sikri, he put the following inscription on the main entrance gate: \"The world is a bridge; cross over it but build no house on it.\"\n\n**Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj's Teachings**\n\nRealizing the truth of this statement, devotees look on their home as only a temporary dwelling place.\n\n### Intellect Firmly Fixed in Me\n\nDevotees have deep conviction in the supremacy of God's position in creation and in their eternal relationship with Him.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Statement**\n\nThey are also firm in their faith that if they surrender to Him lovingly, by God's grace they will achieve the highest realization.\n\n**The Qualities of a Resolute Devotee**\n\nHence, they neither wander from attraction-to-attraction or from path-to-path.

    "explanation": "**The Qualities of Devotees as Described by Shree Krishna**\n\nShree Krishna describes ten more qualities here.\n\n### Alike to Friend and Foe\n\nDevotees are positively disposed toward all and are not swayed by the sentiments of enmity and friendship. There is a beautiful story about Prahlad regarding this.\n\n**The Story of Prahlad and Sudhanva**\n\nOnce, his son, Virochan, got into an argument with his Guru’s son Sudhanva. Virochan said, “I am superior to you because I am the son of a king.” Sudhanva claimed, “I am superior because I am the son of a Rishi.” They were both young, and in their impetuousness, they laid bets. Both said, “Whoever is proved superior will live while the other will have to die.” Now, who would be the judge? Sudhanva said to Virochan, “Your father, Prahlad, will be the judge.” Virochan exclaimed, “Really! But then you will complain that he has been partial.” “No, my father, Rishi Angira, has said that your father Prahlad is perfectly just, and will never differentiate between friend and foe.”\n\nThe two boys went to Prahlad. Virochan asked, “Father, am I superior or Sudhanva?” Prahlad said, “Why did this question arise?” “Father we have laid bets that whoever is proved superior will remain alive while the other will have to die.” Prahlad smiled and said, “Your friend, Sudhanva, is superior since he is the son of your father’s Guru.” Prahlad ordered his servants, “Take my son to the gallows and hang him.”\n\nAt that moment, Sudhanva intervened. “Wait!” he said to Prahlad, “I have a second question. Am I superior or you?” Prahlad replied, “I have been born in a family of demons, while you are the son of a Rishi, who is also my Guru. Hence, you are superior.” Sudhanva again asked, “In that case, will you obey my instruction?” “Yes, of course,” responded Prahlad. “Ok, then leave Virochan,” said Sudhanva. Prahlad instructed his servants, “Leave him,” in the same manner as he had said, “Take him to the gallows.”\n\nThe celestial gods showered flowers into his court, and hailed the quality of justice that Prahlad displayed. This attitude of justice came naturally to Prahlad because by virtue of being a perfect devotee of the Lord he was equal to friend, foe, relative, kith, kin, and outsider.\n\n### Equipoised in Honor and Dishonor\n\nShree Krishna further mentions that the devotees pay no heed to honor and dishonor. This is just like when a person begins engaging in an illicit relationship, he or she is mindful of what others will say, but when the relationship becomes deep, then the person no longer cares about the disrepute it will bring. Similarly, in the heart of the devotee the flame of divine love burns so brightly that worldly honor and dishonor no longer carry any importance.\n\n### Alike in Cold and Heat, Joy and Sorrow\n\nThe devotees are equipoised in favorable and unfavorable circumstances. They know that none of these are permanent. They come and go like the day and the night, and so they do not consider it worth their while to take their thoughts off God and focus on either of them.\n\n### Free from Unfavorable Association\n\nAssociating with persons or objects is called saṅg. There are two kinds of saṅg. Association that takes our mind to the world is kusaṅg (unfavorable association), and that which takes our mind away from the world and toward God is called satsaṅg (favorable association). Since devotees do not relish worldly thoughts, they naturally avoid kusaṅg and engage in satsaṅg.\n\n### Take Praise and Reproach Alike\n\nFor those who are externally motivated, the appreciation and rejection by others is all-important. However, devotees are internally motivated by the principles they value within themselves. Hence, neither commendation nor denunciation by others makes any difference to them.\n\n### Given to Silent Contemplation\n\nCrows and swans have diametrically opposite choices. While crows are drawn to garbage piles, the majestic swans are attracted by tranquil lakes. Similarly, the minds of worldly people find great relish in conversing about materialistic topics. But the saintly devotees possess pure minds, and thus worldly talks seem as attractive to them as a pile of garbage. This does not mean that they do not converse. Like the swan drawn to the lakes, their minds are drawn toward topics such as the Names, Forms, Pastimes, and Glories of God.\n\n### Content with Whatever Comes Their Way\n\nThe needs of the devotees shrink to the bare necessities for maintaining the body. Saint Kabir expresses this in his famous couplet:\n\n“O Lord, give me just enough for the bare maintenance of my family’s bodily needs, and for giving alms to the sadhu who comes to my door.”\n\n### Without Attachment to the Place of Residence\n\nNo earthly home can be a permanent residence for the soul, for it must necessarily be left behind at the time of death. When the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, built his capital, Fatehpur Sikri, he put the following inscription on the main entrance gate: “The world is a bridge; cross over it but build no house on it.” In the same vein, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:\n\n“Live in this world as a traveler lives in a wayside inn (aware that it is to be vacated the next morning).”\n\nRealizing the truth of this statement, devotees look on their home as only a temporary dwelling place.\n\n### Intellect is Firmly Fixed in Me\n\nDevotees have deep conviction in the supremacy of God’s position in creation and in their eternal relationship with Him. They are also firm in their faith that if they surrender to Him lovingly, by God’s grace they will achieve the highest realization. Hence, they neither wander from attraction-to-attraction or from path-to-path. Shree Krishna declares such resolute devotees to be very dear to Him."

    "explanation": "**Distinction between Body and Spirit**\n=====================================\n\n### Explanation of Distinction\n\nIn Chapter 13.2, Shree Krishna begins explaining the topic of distinction between the body and spirit.\n\nThe soul is divine, and can neither eat, see, smell, hear, taste, nor touch. It vicariously does all these works through the body-mind-intellect mechanism, which is thus termed as the field of activities. In modern science, we have terms like “field of energy.” A magnet has a magnetic field around it, which creates electricity on rapid movement. An electric charge has a force field around it.\n\n### Understanding the Body as a Field of Activities\n\nHere, the body is the receptacle for the activities of the individual. Hence, it is termed as **kṣhetra** (the field of activities).\n\n### The Soul's Distinct Identity\n\nThe soul is distinct from the body-mind-intellect mechanism, but forgetful of its divine nature, it identifies with these material entities. Yet, because it has knowledge of the body, it is called **kṣhetrajña** (the knower of the field of the body).\n\n### Terminology Used by Self-Realized Sages\n\nThis terminology has been given by the self-realized sages, who were transcendentally situated at the platform of the soul, and perceived their distinct identity separate from the body.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   The soul is divine and cannot interact with physical senses.\n*   The body serves as a receptacle for the soul's activities.\n*   The soul is distinct from the body but often forgets its divine nature.\n*   Those with self-realized knowledge can distinguish between their true identity and the material world."

Even in this limited context, the soul's knowledge of its field is incomplete. God is the knower of the fields of all souls, being situated as the Supreme Soul in the heart of all living beings. Further, God's knowledge of each **kṣhetra** (field) is perfect and complete.\n\n### The Position of the Three Entities\n\nBy explaining these distinctions, Shree Krishna establishes the position of the three entities vis-à-vis each other—the material body, the soul, and the Supreme Soul.\n\n### Definition of Knowledge\n\nIn the second part of the above verse, He gives His definition of knowledge. \"Understanding of the self, the Supreme Lord, the body, and the distinction amongst these, is true knowledge.\" In this light, persons with PhDs and DLitts may consider themselves to be erudite, but if they do not understand the distinction between their body, the soul, and God, then according to Shree Krishna's definition, they are really not knowledgeable.\n\n### Quotes\n\n* \"Understanding of the self, the Supreme Lord, the body, and the distinction amongst these, is true knowledge.\" - Shree Krishna\n* \"Even in this limited context, the soul's knowledge of its field is incomplete.\" - Verse 13.3\n* \"God's knowledge of each kṣhetra is perfect and complete.\" - Verse 13.3"

By posing questions to Arjun, Shree Krishna is not only seeking answers but also encouraging him to think critically and reflect on his own beliefs.\n\n### Arjun's Careful Listening\n\nShree Krishna asks Arjun to listen carefully to their answers, indicating that he values the importance of attentive listening. This is particularly significant in a conversation where the stakes are high, and the subject matter is deeply personal.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- Shree Krishna's questions reflect his desire to understand the truth and engage Arjun in a meaningful conversation.\n- The act of listening carefully is essential in this context, as it allows Arjun to fully comprehend the answers and integrate them into his own understanding of reality."

    "explanation": "**Vedas: The Eternal Knowledge of God**\n=====================================\n\nKnowledge is appealing to the intellect when it is expressed with precision and clarity, and is substantiated with sound logic. Further, for it to be accepted as infallible, it must be confirmed on the basis of infallible authority. The reference for validating spiritual knowledge is the Vedas.\n\n### What are the Vedas?\n\nThese are not just the name of some books; they are the eternal knowledge of God. Whenever God creates the world, He manifests the Vedas for the benefit of the souls.\n\n**The Origin and Revelation of the Vedas**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad (4.5.11) states:\n\n```python\nniḥśhvasitamasya vedāḥ \n```\n\n\"The Vedas manifested from the breath of God.\"\n\nThey were first revealed in the heart of the first-born Brahma. From there, they came down through the oral tradition, and hence, another name for them is **Śhruti**, or \"knowledge received through the ear.\"\n\n**The Division and Compilation of the Vedas**\n------------------------------------------\n\nAt the beginning of the age of Kali, Ved Vyas, who was himself a descension of God, put down the Vedas in the form of a book, and divided the one body of knowledge into four portions— **Ṛig Veda**, **Yajur Veda**, **Sāma Veda**, and **Atharva Veda**. Hence, he got the name **Ved Vyās**, or \"one who divided the Vedas.\"\n\n**The Apauruṣheya Nature of the Vedas**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe distinction must be borne in mind that Ved Vyas is never referred to as the composer of the Vedas but merely the one who divided them. Hence, the Vedas are also called **apauruṣheya**, which means \"not created by any person.\" They are respected as the infallible authority for spiritual knowledge.\n\n### Other Important Vedic Scriptures\n------------------------------------\n\n*   **Itihās**: These are historical texts, and are two in number, the **Ramayan** and the **Mahabharat**. They describe the history related to two important descensions of God.\n*   **Puranas**: These contain 400,000 verses and describe the divine Pastimes of the various forms of God and His devotees.\n*   **Ṣhaḍ-darśhan**: These come next in importance amongst the Vedic scriptures. Six sages wrote six scriptures highlighting particular aspects of Hindu philosophy.\n\n**Ṣhaḍ-darśhan**\n-----------------\n\nThese six scriptures are:\n\n1.  **Mīmānsā**: Written by Maharishi (Sage) Jaimini, it describes ritualistic duties and ceremonies.\n2.  **Vedānt Darśhan**: Written by Maharishi Ved Vyas, it discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth.\n3.  **Nyāya Darśhan**: Written by Maharishi Gautam, it develops a system of logic for understanding life and the Absolute Truth.\n4.  **Vaiśheṣhik Darśhan**: Written by Maharishi Kanad, it analyses cosmology and creation from the perspective of its various elements.\n5.  **Yog Darśhan**: Written by Maharishi Patañjali, it describes an eightfold path to union with God, beginning with physical postures.\n6.  **Sānkhya Darśhan**: Written by Maharishi Kapil, it describes the evolution of the Universe from **prakṛiti**, the primordial form of the material energy.\n\n### Conclusion\n--------------\n\nAmongst these scriptural texts, the **Brahma Sūtra** (Vedānt Darśhan) is considered as the last word on the topic of the distinction between the soul, the material body, and God. Hence, Shree Krishna particularly mentions it in the above verse.\n\n\"The Shreemad Bhagavatam reveals the meaning and the essence of the Vedānt Darśhan and all the Upanishads.\"\n\nOut of respect for Ved Vyas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not deem it fit to write another commentary on the scripture."

    "explanation": "**The Field of Activities**\n==========================\n\n### Overview of the Field of Activities\n\nShree Krishna uses the term \"_daśhaikaṁ_\" (ten plus one) to indicate the eleven senses. In these, He includes the mind along with the five knowledge senses and the five working senses.\n\n### The Five Gross Elements\n\nThe twenty-four elements that constitute the field of activities are:\n\n1.  Pañcha-mahābhūta (the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, and space)\n\n### The Five Sense Objects\n\nThe five sense objects have been included in the field of activities, when they exist outside the body.\n\n#### Why Include the Five Sense Objects?\n\nThe reason is that the mind contemplates upon the sense objects, and these five sense objects reside in a subtle form in the mind.\n\n#### The Subtle Form of Sense Objects\n\nThis illustrates that the gross objects of the senses also exist mentally in the subtle form.\n\n#### Classification vs. Philosophical Difference\n\nShree Krishna has included them here because He is referring to the entire field of activity for the soul.\n\nSome other scriptures exclude the five sense objects while describing the body. Instead, they include the five prāṇas (life-airs). This is merely a matter of classification and not a philosophical difference.\n\n### The Field Expressed in Terms of Sheaths\n\nThe field of the body has five kośhas (sheaths) that cover the soul that is ensconced within:\n\n#### The Five Kośhas\n\n1.  Annamaya kośh. (the gross sheath, consisting of the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air, and space)\n2.  Prāṇamaya kośh. (the life-airs sheath, consisting of the five life airs—prāṇ, apān, vyān, samān, and udān)\n3.  Manomaya kośh. (the mental sheath, consisting of the mind and the five working senses—voice, hands, legs, genitals, and anus)\n4.  Vijñānamaya kośh. (the intellectual sheath, consisting of the intellect and the five knowledge senses—ears, eyes, tongue, skin, and nose)\n5.  Ānandmaya kośh. (the bliss sheath, which consists of the ego that makes us identify with the tiny bliss of the body-mind-intellect mechanism)"

    "explanation": "**The Attributes of the Field (Kṣhetra)**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Kṣhetra and Its Modifications\n\nShree Krishna now elucidates the attributes of the kṣhetra, or field, and its modifications thereof:\n\n#### Body Transformations\n\nThe field of activities includes the body, but is much more than that. The body undergoes six transformations until death—\n\n*   **asti** (coming into existence)\n*   **jāyate** (birth)\n*   **vardhate** (growth)\n*   **viparinamate** (reproduction)\n*   **apakṣhīyate** (withering with age)\n*   **vinaśhyati** (death)\n\nThe body supports the soul in its quest for happiness in the world or in God, as the soul guides it.\n\n#### Consciousness\n\nConsciousness is the life force that exists in the soul, and which it also imparts to the body while it is present in it. This is just as fire has the ability to heat, and if we put an iron rod into it, the rod too becomes red hot with the heat it receives from the fire. Similarly, the soul makes the body seem lifelike by imparting the quality of consciousness in it. Shree Krishna thus includes consciousness as a trait of the field of activities.\n\n### The Will\n\nWill is the determination that keeps the constituent elements of the body active and focused in a particular direction. It is the will that enables the soul to achieve goals through the field of activities.\n\n#### Variations in Will\n\nThe will is a quality of the intellect, which is energized by the soul. Variations in the will due to the influence of sattva guṇa, rajo guṇa, and tamo guṇa are described in verses 18.33 to 18.35.\n\n### Desire\n\nDesire is a function of the mind and the intellect, which creates a longing for the acquisition of an object, a situation, a person, etc. In discussing the body, we would probably take desire for granted, but imagine how different the nature of life would have been if there were no desires.\n\n#### The Nature of Desire\n\nThe intellect analyses the desirability of an object, and the mind harbors its desire. When one becomes self-realized, all material desires are extinguished, and now the purified mind harbors the desire for God. While material desires are the cause of bondage, spiritual desires lead to liberation.\n\n### Aversion\n\nAversion is a state of the mind and intellect that creates revulsion for objects, persons, and situations that are disagreeable to it, and seeks to avoid them.\n\n### Happiness\n\nHappiness is a feeling of pleasure that is experienced in the mind through agreeable circumstances and fulfillment of desires. The mind perceives the sensations of happiness, and the soul does so along with it because it identifies with the mind.\n\n#### The Nature of Happiness\n\nHowever, material happiness never satiates the hunger of the soul, which remains discontented until it experiences the infinite divine bliss of God.\n\n### Misery\n\nMisery is the pain experienced in the mind through disagreeable circumstances."

    "explanation": "**The Virtues of Spiritual Growth**\n=====================================\n\nTo gain knowledge of the kṣhetra and kṣhetrajña is not merely an intellectual exercise. Spiritual knowledge, as discussed in these five verses, requires purification of the heart.\n\n**Humbleness**\n-------------\n\nPride is a major obstacle on the path of self-realization. When we become proud of our individual attributes, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc., we forget that God has given them to us. This pride results in distancing our consciousness from God.\n\n*   When we think we are better than others, we forget the divine.\n*   Pride leads to attachment and separation from God.\n\n**Freedom from Hypocrisy**\n------------------------\n\nA hypocrite develops an artificial external personality, creating a facade of virtuosity on the outside. However, this is hollow and lacking in substance.\n\n*   Hypocrisy causes inner turmoil and separation from God.\n*   The outer display of virtues is skin-deep.\n\n**Non-Violence**\n-------------\n\nThe cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings. This is achieved through the practice of non-violence.\n\n*   The scriptures state: \"If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.\"\n*   Non-violence is essential for spiritual growth.\n\n**Forgiveness**\n-------------\n\nForgiveness is freedom from ill will, even toward those who have harmed us. Harboring ill will harms our own minds and purifies it.\n\n*   Forgiveness releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.\n*   Practicing forgiveness allows us to move forward on our spiritual path.\n\n**Simplicity**\n-------------\n\nSimplicity includes:\n\n*   Straightforwardness in thought: absence of deceit, envy, crookedness.\n*   Straightforwardness in speech: absence of taunt, censure, gossip.\n*   Straightforwardness in action: plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior.\n\n**Service of the Guru**\n----------------------\n\nSpiritual knowledge is received from the Guru. This requires dedication and devotion toward the Guru.\n\n*   By serving the Guru, we develop humbleness and commitment.\n*   The Guru imparts knowledge because they have seen the truth.\n\n**Cleanliness of Body and Mind**\n-----------------------------\n\nPurity should be both internal and external. The Śhāṅdilya Upaniṣhad states:\n\n*   \"There are two types of cleanliness: internal and external.\"\n*   External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline.\n*   Mental cleanliness is even more important and is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.\n\n**Steadfastness**\n----------------\n\nSelf-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that can be attained in a day. Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.\n\n*   The scriptures state: \"Keep moving forward.

    "explanation": "**The Virtues of Spiritual Knowledge**\n\nTo gain knowledge of the **kṣhetra** and **kṣhetrajña**, is not merely an intellectual exercise. Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one's character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.\n\n**The Virtues**\n\nShree Krishna describes five virtues that purify one's life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.\n\n### 1. Humbleness\n\nWhen we become proud of our attributes, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc., we forget that God has given us these attributes. Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God, and it is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization.\n\n### 2. Freedom from Hypocrisy\n\nThe hypocrite develops an artificial external personality, while a person defective from inside creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside. The external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.\n\n### 3. Non-violence\n\nThe cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings, and this is achieved through the practice of non-violence. The scriptures state: \"If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.\"\n\n### 4. Forgiveness\n\nForgiveness is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed us. Harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other person. By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.\n\n### 5. Simplicity\n\nSimplicity is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action. Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc. Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc. Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living and forthrightness in behavior.\n\n### The Importance of Spiritual Knowledge\n\nShree Krishna explains that spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru. This requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.\n\n**The Virtues of a Disciple**\n\nTo receive spiritual knowledge from the Guru, a disciple must possess qualities such as:\n\n* **Cleanliness of Body and Mind**: Purity should be both internal and external.\n* **Steadfastness**: Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day. Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.\n* **Self-control**: It is the restraint of the mind and senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.\n* **Dispassion toward the Objects of the Senses**: Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.\n* **Absence of Egotism**: Egotism is classified as nescience, and it must be eliminated to invite God into our hearts.\n* **Non-attachment**: It means dispassion toward the world and detachment from material objects and persons.\n* **Constancy in Spiritual Knowledge**: To practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives, we must repeatedly contemplate upon it.\n\n### The Importance of Spiritual Pursuit\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes the importance of spiritual pursuit, even in the face of difficulties and challenges. We must develop a strong will to overcome our weaknesses and limitations.\n\n**The Virtues of Spiritual Knowledge**\n\nAll the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge. The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.\n\n**The Result of Ignorance and Darkness**\n\nSuch dispositions cripple the development of self-knowledge. Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness.\n\n**The Call to Spiritual Pursuit**\n\nShree Krishna's teachings emphasize the importance of spiritual pursuit and the need to cultivate virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that lead to wisdom and knowledge. We must strive to eliminate ignorance and darkness and invite God into our hearts.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe pursuit of spiritual knowledge is a lifelong journey that requires dedication, devotion, and self-control. We must cultivate virtues such as humbleness, freedom from hypocrisy, non-violence, forgiveness, simplicity, and steadfastness to grow in wisdom and knowledge. By following these principles, we can develop a strong will to overcome our weaknesses and limitations and invite God into our hearts."

When we become proud of our individual fields, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc., we forget that God has given all these attributes to us. Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God, creating a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.\n\n### Freedom from Hypocrisy\n\nFreedom from hypocrisy involves developing an artificial external personality. A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside. Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.\n\n### Non-Violence\n\nNon-violence involves respect for all living beings. This requires the practice of non-violence.

Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.\n\n### Absence of Egotism\n\nAbsence of egotism involves the conscious awareness of \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"mine.\" This is classified as nescience because it arises at the bodily level, identified with the body.\n\n### Non-Attachment\n\nNon-attachment involves dispassion toward the world. We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.\n\n### Constancy in Spiritual Knowledge\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo theoretically know something is not enough. One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly. We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.\n\n### Philosophical Pursuit of the Absolute Truth\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEven animals engage in bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge. This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions:\n\n*   Who am I?\n*   Why am I here?\n*   What is my goal in life?\n*   How was this world created?\n*   What is my connection with the Creator?\n*   How will I fulfill my purpose in life?\n\n### Conclusion\n-------------\n\nAll the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge. The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc. Such dispositions cripple the development of self-knowledge.

This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and! toward the Guru. By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge. Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:\n\n\"Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\"\n\n**Cleanliness of Body and Mind**\n-------------------------------\n\nPurity should be both internal and external. The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:\n\nśhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti\n\n\"There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.\" External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind. But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.\n\n**Steadfastness**\n----------------\n\nSelf-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day. Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached. The scriptures state:\n\ncharaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati\n\n\"Keep moving forward. Keep moving forward. Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.\"\n\n**Self-Control**\n-----------------\n\nIt is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect. Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.\n\n**Dispassion toward the Objects of the Senses**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force. Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.\n\n**Absence of Egotism**\n----------------------\n\nEgotism is the conscious awareness of “I,” “me,” and “mine.” This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body. It is also called the ahām chetanā (pride arising out of the sense of self). All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.\n\n**Philosophical Pursuit of the Absolute Truth**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEven animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge. This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I? Why am I here? What is my goal in life? How was this world created? What is my connection with the Creator? How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”\n\n**Constancy in Spiritual Knowledge**\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo theoretically know something is not enough. One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly. We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives. This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once. After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.\n\n**Non-Attachment**\n-----------------\n\nIt means dispassion toward the world. We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons. The sādhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.\n\n**Aversion for Mundane Society**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs. One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.\n\n**Constancy in Spiritual Knowledge**\n-------------------------------------\n\nTo theoretically know something is not enough. One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.

    "explanation": "**The Unity of Day and Night, Brahman**\n=====================================================\n\n### The Interdependence of Light and Darkness\n\nDay and night are like two sides of the same coin, for one cannot exist without the other. We can only say it is day in some place if night too falls in that place. But if there is no night, then there is no day either; there is only perpetual light.\n\n### Brahman Beyond Relative Terms\n\nSimilarly, in the case of Brahman, the word \"existence\" is not descriptive enough. Shree Krishna says that Brahman is beyond the relative terms of existence and non-existence.\n\n### Forms of Brahman\n--------------------\n\n*   **Formless and Attributeless Aspect**: The object of worship of the _jñānīs_ (those who have realized knowledge)\n*   **Personal Form**: The object of worship of the _bhaktas_ (devotees)\n*   **Paramātmā**: Residing within the body\n\n### The Three Manifestations of Brahman\n--------------------------------------\n\nAll these are three manifestations of the same Supreme Reality.\n\n### The Supreme Entity Revealed by Shree Krishna\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLater, in verse 14.27, Shree Krishna states:\n\n`brahmaṇo hi pratiṣhṭhāham`\n\"I am the basis of the formless Brahman.\"\n\nThus, the formless Brahman and the personal form of God are both two aspects of the Supreme Entity.\n\n### The Pervasive Nature of Brahman\n-----------------------------------\n\nBoth exist everywhere, and hence they both can be called all-pervading.\n\n### Contradictory Qualities in God\n----------------------------------\n\nReferring to these, Shree Krishna reveals the contradictory qualities that manifest in God."

    "explanation": "**The Infinite Capacity of God**\n=====================================\n\n### Understanding the Limitations of Human Comprehension\n\n13.14\nOften people argue that God cannot have hands, feet, eyes, ears, etc. But Shree Krishna says that God has all these, and to an innumerable extent. We should never fall into the trap of circumscribing God within our limited understanding. He is\n\n** kartumakartuṁ anyathā karatuṁ samarthaḥ **\n“He can do the possible, the impossible, and the reverse of the possible.” For that all-powerful God, to say that He cannot have hands and feet, is placing a constraint upon Him.\n\n### The Divine Nature of God's Limbs and Senses\n\nHowever, God’s limbs and senses are divine, while ours are material. The difference between the material and the transcendental is that while we are limited to one set of senses, God possesses unlimited hands and legs, eyes, and ears.\n\n**Key Differences**\n\n*   Our senses exist in one place.\n*   God’s senses are everywhere.\n\n### Omnipresence and Omniscience\n\nThis is possible because, just as He is all-pervading in creation, His eyes and ears are also ubiquitous. The Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad states:\n\n**sarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma**\n“(3.14.1) “Everywhere is Brahman.” Hence, He accepts food offerings made to Him anywhere in the universe; He hears the prayers of His devotees, wherever they may be; and He is the Witness of all that occurs in the three worlds.\n\n### Accepting Devotions from Distant Locations\n\nIf millions of devotees venerate Him at the same time, He has no problem in accepting the prayers of all of them.\n\n**The All-Pervading Nature of God**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis understanding is based on the concept that God is all-pervading, meaning He exists everywhere and sees everything. This perspective allows us to comprehend God's infinite capacity and accept Him for who He is.\n\n### The Significance of Accepting the Limitations of Human Comprehension\n\nBy acknowledging that God's nature transcends human limitations, we can:\n\n*   Gain a deeper understanding of His infinite potential\n*   Develop a more profound appreciation for the divine\n*   Cultivate humility and acceptance in our understanding of God's nature"

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Paradox of God's Senses**\n\nShree Krishna presents a paradoxical statement about God's senses: \"He does not possess any senses.\" This seems contradictory, as it appears that God would have both infinite senses and be without them. However, mundane logic does not apply to Him who is beyond the reach of the intellect.\n\n**God's Infinite Contradictory Attributes**\n\nAccording to the Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇ, God possesses infinite contradictory attributes at the same time. The verse states:\n\n> \"The Supreme Lord is the reservoir of innumerable contradictory attributes.\" (viruddha dharmo rūposā vaiśhvaryāt puruṣhottamāh)\n\nIn this context, Shree Krishna mentions a few of the infinite contradictory attributes that exist in the personality of God.\n\n**Material and Divine Senses**\n\nShree Krishna explains that God is devoid of mundane senses like ours. It is correct to say that He does not have senses in the material sense.\n\n> \"He is without material senses.\" (Sarvendriya vivarjitam)\n\nHowever, He possesses divine senses that are everywhere, Consequently, it is also correct to say that the senses of God are in all places.\n\n> \"He manifests the functions of the senses and grasps the sense objects.\" (Sarvendriya guṇābhāsaṁ)\n\n**God's Relationships with Creation**\n\nFurther, Shree Krishna states that He is the sustainer of creation, and yet detached from it. In His form as Lord Vishnu, God maintains the entire creation.\n\n> \"He sits in the hearts of all living beings, notes their karmas, and gives the results.\" (In His form as Lord Vishnu)\n\nUnder Lord Vishnu's dominion, Brahma manipulates the laws of material science to ensure that the universe functions stably. Also, under Lord Vishnu's dominion, the celestial gods arrange to provide the air, earth, water, rain, etc. that are necessary for our survival.\n\n> \"Hence, God is the Sustainer of all.\" (Under Lord Vishnu's dominion)\n\n**God's Detachment and Independence**\n\nYet, He is complete in Himself and is, thus, detached from everyone. The Vedas mention Him as:\n\n> \"one who rejoices in the self and has no need of anything external.\" (ātmārām)\n\nThe material energy is subservient to God, and it works for His pleasure by serving Him. He is thus the enjoyer of the three guṇas (modes of material nature). At the same time, He is also nirguṇa (beyond the three guṇas), because these guṇas are material, while God is divine.\n\n> \"He is beyond the three guṇas\" (At the same time)"

All manifest and unmanifest objects are but expansions of His energy. Thus, we can say He is all that exists.\n\n### The Supreme Lord's Manifestations\n\nAccording to Shreemad Bhagavatam, the various aspects of creation—time, karma, the natures of individual living beings, and the material ingredients of creation—are all the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna Himself. There is nothing in existence apart from Him.\n\n### The Illusion of Division\n\nGod may appear to be divided amongst the objects of His creation, but since He is all that exists, He remains undivided as well.\n\n### Examples of Illusions\n\n*   **Space**: Space may seem to be divided amongst the objects that it contains. Yet, all objects are within the one entity called space, which manifested at the beginning of creation.\n*   **Reflection of the Sun**: The reflection of the sun in puddles of water appears divided, and yet the sun remains indivisible.\n\n### The Cycle of Creation and Destruction\n\nJust as the ocean throws up waves and then absorbs them back into itself, similarly God creates the world, maintains it, and then absorbs it back into Himself.

However, He deems it fit to bring in devotion, stating that only the **bhaktas** (devotees) can truly understand this knowledge. Those who practice **karm**, **jñāna**, and other paths devoid of **bhakti** cannot truly comprehend the import of the Bhagavad Gita, even if they think they do.\n\n**The Importance of Bhakti**\n---------------------------\n\nBhakti is the essential ingredient in all paths leading to knowledge of God. As Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj puts it:\n\n\"**That work which is done in devotion to God is the real karm; and that knowledge which increases love for God is real knowledge.**\"\n\n(Bhakti Śhatak 66)\n\nDevotion not only helps us to know God, but also makes the devotee godlike. Therefore, Shree Krishna states that the devotees attain His nature.\n\n**Vedic Scriptures Emphasize Bhakti**\n----------------------------------\n\nThe Vedas state:\n\n\"**Bhaktirevainaṁ nayati bhaktirevainaṁ paśhyati bhaktirevainaṁ darśhayati bhakti vaśhaḥ puruṣho bhaktireva bhūyasī**\"\n\n(Māṭhar Śhruti)\n\n\"**Bhakti alone can lead us to God. Bhakti alone can make us see God. Bhakti alone can bring us in the presence of God. God is under the control of bhakti. Hence, do bhakti exclusively.**\"\n\nThe Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states:\n\n\"**Those who engage in bhakti toward the Supreme Divine Personality, giving up all material desires, escape the cycle of life and death.**\"\n\n(3.2.1)\n\nThe Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:\n\n\"**Those who have unflinching bhakti toward God and identical bhakti toward the Guru, in the hearts of such saintly persons, by the grace of God the imports of the Vedic scriptures are automatically revealed.**\"\n\n(6.23)\n\nThe Vedic Scriptures Emphasize the Importance of Bhakti\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe other Vedic Scriptures also reiterate this emphatically:\n\n\"**Na sādhayati māṁ yogo na sānkhyaṁ dharma uddhava. Na svādhyāyas tapas tyāgo yathā bhaktir mamorjitā**\"\n\n(Bhagavatam 11.14.20)\n\nShree Krishna states: \"Uddhav, I am not attained by **aṣhṭāṅg-yog**, by the study of **sānkhya**, cultivation of scriptural knowledge, austerities, nor by renunciation. It is by **bhakti** alone that I am won over.\"\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly states this, in verses 8.22, 11.54, etc. In verse 18.55, He says: \"Only by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth. Then, having come to know Me, My devotee enters into full consciousness of Me.\"\n\n**The Ramayan Emphasizes the Importance of Bhakti**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\n\"**Rāmahi kevala premu piārā, jāni leu jo jānanihārā.**\"\n\n\"The Supreme Lord Ram is only attained through love. Let this truth be known by all who care to know.\"\n\n**Bhakti in Other Religious Traditions**\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe principle of Bhakti is also emphasized in other religious traditions. In the Jewish Torah, it is written: \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might (Deuteronomy 6.5).\"\n\nJesus of Nazareth repeats this commandment in the Christian New Testament as one of the first and foremost commandments to follow (Mark 12.30).\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib states:\n\n\"**Hari sama jaga mahañ vastu nahiṅ, prem panth soñ pantha. Sadguru sama sajjan nahīñ, gītā sama nahiṅ grantha.**\"\n\n\"There is no personality like God; there is no path equal to the path of devotion; there is no human equal to the Guru; and there is no scripture that can compare with the Gita.\""

    "explanation": "**The Material Energy and Its Role in Creation**\n=================================================================\n\n### Creating Myriad Elements and Forms of Life\n\nThe material energy, with the direction of Brahma, creates myriad elements and forms of life that compose creation. Brahma makes the master plan and the material energy executes it. The Vedas state that there are 8.4 million species of life in the material world. All these bodily forms are transformations of the material energy. Hence, material nature is responsible for all the cause and effect in the world.\n\n### The Soul's Response to Karmas\n\nThe soul gets a bodily form (field of activity) according to its past karmas, and it identifies itself with the body, mind, and intellect. Thus, it seeks the pleasure of the bodily senses. When the senses come in contact with the sense objects, the mind experiences a pleasurable sensation. Since the soul identifies with the mind, it vicariously enjoys that pleasurable sensation. In this way, the soul perceives the sensations of both pleasure and pain, through the medium of the senses, mind, and intellect.\n\n### A Dream State Analogy\n\nehi bidhi jaga hari �āśhrita rahaī, jadapi asatya deta duḥkha ahaī\n(Ramayan)\njauṅ sapaneṅ sira kāṭai koī, binu jāgeṅ na dūri dukh hoī\n(Ramayan)\n\n**The Illusion of the Material World**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\"The world is sustained by God. It creates an illusion, which, although unreal, gives misery to the soul. This is just like if someone's head gets cut in a dream, the misery will continue until the person wakes up and stops dreaming.\" In this dream state of identifying with the body, the soul experiences pleasure and pain in accordance with its own past and present karmas. As a result, it is said to be responsible for both kinds of experiences.\n\n### The Consequences of Identifying with the Body\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this way, the soul perpetuates the cycle of pleasure and pain, influenced by its past karmas. The material energy, responsible for creating the world, also perpetuates this cycle. Ultimately, it is the soul's identification with the body and mind that leads to its experience of pleasure and pain, trapping it in this cycle of cause and effect."

Now, He explains how this is so.\n\n**The Body as an Instrument**\nConsidering the body to be the self, the soul energizes it into activity that is directed at enjoying bodily pleasures.\n\n### The Three Modes of Nature\n\nSince the body is made of Maya, it seeks to enjoy the material energy that is made of the three modes (**guṇas**)—mode of goodness, mode of passion, and mode of ignorance.\n\n### The Role of the Ego\n\nDue to the ego, the soul identifies itself as the doer and the enjoyer of the body.\n\n**The Chain of Command**\nThe body, mind, and intellect perform all the activities, but the soul is held responsible for them. Just as when a bus has an accident, the wheels and the steering are not blamed for it; the driver is answerable for any mishap to the bus.\n\n### The Soul's Responsibility\n\nSimilarly, the senses, mind, and intellect are energized by the soul and they work under its dominion.

Now in this verse He explains the position of the `Paramātmā` (Supreme Soul), who also resides within the body. He previously mentioned the `Paramātmā` in verse 13.3 as well, when He stated that the individual soul is the knower of the individual body while the Supreme Soul is the knower of all the infinite bodies.\n\n**The Role of Paramātmā**\n---------------------------\n\nThe Supreme Soul, who is located within everyone, also manifests in the personal form as Lord Vishnu. The Supreme Lord in His form as Vishnu is responsible for maintaining this creation. He resides in the `Kṣhīr Sāgar` (the ocean of milk), at the top of the universe in His personal form. He also expands Himself to reside in the hearts of all living beings as the `Paramātmā`.\n\n**Attributes and Responsibilities**\n----------------------------------\n\nSeated within, He notes their actions, keeps an account of their karmas, and bestows the results at the proper time. He accompanies the `jīvātmā` (individual soul) to whatever body it receives in each lifetime. He does not hesitate in residing in the body of a snake, a pig, or insect.\n\n**The Muṇḍakopaniṣhad's Account**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states:\n\ndvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyā \nsamānaṁ vṛikṣhaṁ pariṣhasvajāte\ntayoranyaḥ pippalaṁ svādvattya-\nnaśhnannanyo abhichākaśhīti\nsamāne vṛikṣhe puruṣho nimagno-\n’nīśhayā śhochati muhyamānaḥ\njuṣhtaṁ yadā paśhyatyanyamīśha-\nmasya mahimānamiti vītaśhokaḥ\n\n**A Metaphor for the Relationship between Jīvātmā and Paramātmā**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n“Two birds are seated in the nest (heart) of the tree (the body) of the living form. They are the `jīvātmā` and `Paramātmā`. The `jīvātmā` has its back toward the `Paramātmā`, and is busy enjoying the fruits of the tree (the results of the karmas it receives while residing in the body). When a sweet fruit comes, it becomes happy; when a bitter fruit comes, it becomes sad. The `Paramātmā` is a friend of the `jīvātmā`, but He does not interfere; He simply sits and watches. If the `jīvātmā` can only turn around to the `Paramātmā`, all its miseries will come to an end.”\n\n**The Role of Free Will**\n-------------------------\n\nThe `jīvātmā` has been bestowed with free will i.e. the freedom to turn away or toward God. By the improper use of that free will the `jīvātmā` is in bondage, and by learning its proper usage, it can attain the eternal service of God and experience infinite bliss."

The Abrahamic traditions accept the existence of the soul in humans, but do not accept that other forms of life also have souls. This concept condones violence toward the other life forms.\n\n### Contrary to Abrahamic Traditions\n\nHowever, the Vedic philosophy stresses that wherever consciousness exists, there must be the presence of the soul. Without it, there can be no consciousness.\n\n### Scientific Observations\n\nIn the early twentieth century, Sir J.C. Bose established through experiments that even plants, which are non-moving life forms, can feel and respond to emotions. His experiments proved that soothing music can enhance the growth of plants.\n\n### Observations on Plant Consciousness\n\nWhen a hunter shoots a bird sitting on a tree, the vibrations of the tree seem to indicate that it weeps for the bird. And when a loving gardener enters the garden, the trees feel joyous.\n\n### Corroborating Shree Krishna's Statement\n\nThese observations corroborate Shree Krishna's statement that all life forms possess consciousness; they are the combination of the eternal soul, which is the source of consciousness, and the body, which is made of the insentient material energy."

    "explanation": "**The Ego's Grip: A Trap for the Soul**\n\n13.30 The Tantra Bhāgavat states:\n\n**The Illusion of the Ego**\n\n\"The ego of being the body and the pride of being the doer trap the soul in the samsara of life and death.\" In material consciousness, our ego makes us identify with the body. We then attribute the actions of the body to the soul and think, \"I am doing this... I am doing that.\" This illusion creates a false sense of ownership and control.\n\n**The Truth Revealed by Enlightenment**\n\nBut the enlightened soul perceives that while eating, drinking, talking, walking, etc., it is only the body that acts. We can observe this phenomenon firsthand by paying attention to our thoughts and actions. Yet, we cannot shrug the responsibility of the actions performed by the body. We must acknowledge that our true responsibility lies not with our physical body but with the soul.\n\n**A Lesson from Maharishi Vasishth**\n\nMaharishi Vasishth instructed Ram:\n\n\"Ram, while working, externally exert Yourself as if the results depend upon You; but internally, realize Yourself to be the non-doer.\"\n\n**The Art of Balance**\n\nTo achieve true freedom and responsibility, a spiritual aspirant must keep both sides in mind. We must recognize that our actions have consequences and accept the responsibility for those outcomes, while also understanding that we are not bound by our physical body's limitations.\n\n**The Non-Doer: A State of Awareness**\n\nRam understood the importance of this lesson, and Maharishi Vasishth imparted it to him. By embracing this principle, we can transcend the ego's grip and live a life of greater awareness, freedom, and responsibility."

These souls are innumerable in number.”**\n\nThis represents a manner of expressing the minuteness of the soul. So, how can such an infinitesimal soul energize the body, which is huge in comparison?\n\n### The Sun Analogy\n\nShree Krishna explains this paradox with the analogy of the sun. Although situated in one place, the sun illumines the entire solar system with its light.\n\n**\"The soul, although seated in the heart spreads its consciousness throughout the field of the body.\"**\n\nThis is supported by the Vedānt Darśhan in verse 2.3.25, which states:\n\n**\"guṇādvā lokavat\"**\n\nThis analogy highlights the incredible capacity of the soul to energize and sustain the entire body, despite its own infinitesimal size."

Although it is divine, its identification with the body ties it to material nature.\n\n### The Three Guṇas of Prakṛiti\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe material energy, which is made up of **prakṛiti**, possesses three **guṇas**—goodness, passion, and ignorance.

The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating.\n\n**The Three Modes of Goodness**\n-----------------------------\n\nBy extension, the modes of goodness are:\n\n### 1. Sattva Guṇa\n\nThe mode of goodness is serene and illuminating. It engenders virtue in one's personality and illuminates the intellect with knowledge. It makes a person become calm, satisfied, charitable, compassionate, helpful, serene, and tranquil. It also nurtures good health and freedom from sickness.\n\n### 2. Rājo Guṇa\n\nThe second mode of goodness is `rajo guṇa`, the mode of passion, which excites the passions of the living being, and binds the soul in innumerable worldly desires.\n\n### 3. Tamo Guṇa\n\nThe first mode of goodness is `tamo guṇa`, the mode of ignorance, which literally wants to kill the soul, by degrading it into sloth, languor, and nescience.\n\n**An Example to Illustrate the Modes of Goodness**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLet us understand this through an example. A traveler was passing through a forest, when three robbers attacked him. The first said, \"Let us kill him and steal all his wealth.\" The second said, \"No, let us not kill him. We will simply bind him, and take away his possessions.\" Following the advice of the second robber, they tied him up in ropes and stole his wealth. When they had gone some distance away, the third robber returned. He opened the ropes of the traveler, and took him to the edge of the forest. He showed the way out, and said, \"I cannot go out myself, but if you follow this path, you will be able to get out of the forest.\"\n\n### 4. Sattva Guṇa - The Mode of Goodness\n\nThe third robber was `sattva guṇa`, the mode of goodness, which reduces the vices of the living being, eases the material discomfort and puts the soul on the path of virtue. Yet, even `sattva guṇa` is within the realm of material nature. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use it to step up to the transcendental platform.\n\n**Beyond the Three Modes of Goodness**\n--------------------------------------\n\nBeyond these three, is `śhuddha sattva`, the transcendental mode of goodness. It is the mode of the divine energy of God that is beyond material nature. When the soul becomes God-realized, by his grace, God bestows `śhuddha sattva` upon the soul, making the senses, mind, and intellect divine."

The Patañjali Yog Darśhan describes material activity as the primary manifestation of raño guṇa. Here, Shree Krishna describes its principal manifestation as attachment and desire.\n\n**The Mode of Passion**\n\nThe mode of passion fuels the lust for sensual enjoyment. It inflames desires for mental and physical pleasures. It also promotes attachment to worldly things. Persons influenced by raño guṇa get engrossed in worldly pursuits of status, prestige, career, family, and home. They look on these as sources of pleasure and are motivated to undertake intense activity for the sake of these.\n\n**How the Mode of Passion Works**\n\nIn this way, the mode of passion increases desires, and these desires further fuel an increase of the mode of passion. They both nourish each other and trap the soul in worldly life.\n\n**Breaking Free from Raño Guṇa**\n\n### The Way to Break Out of This\n\nThe way to break out of this is to engage in karm yog, i.e. to begin offering the results of one's activities to God.

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Three Modes of Nature**\n\nThe ancient Indian text, known as the Upanishads, describes the three modes of nature that govern human behavior and existence. These modes are:\n\n*   **Sattva Guṇa** (Mode of Goodness)\n*   **Rajo Guṇa** (Mode of Passion)\n*   **Tamo Guṇa** (Mode of Ignorance)\n\n### Sattva Guṇa: The Mode of Goodness\n\nIn the mode of goodness, the miseries of material existence reduce, and worldly desires become subdued. This gives rise to a feeling of contentment with one’s condition. This is a good thing, but it can have a negative side too.\n\n*   For instance, those who experience pain in the world and are disturbed by the desires in their mind feel impelled to look for a solution to their problems, and this impetus sometimes brings them to the spiritual path.\n*   However, those in goodness can easily become complacent and feel no urge to progress to the transcendental platform.\n\n### Sattva Guṇa: Illuminating the Intellect\n\nSattva guṇa illuminates the intellect with knowledge. If this is not accompanied by spiritual wisdom, then knowledge results in pride and that pride comes in the way of devotion to God. This is often seen in the case of scientists, academicians, scholars, etc.\n\n*   The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge.\n*   And yet, the knowledge they possess often makes them proud, and they begin to feel that there can be no truth beyond the grasp of their intellect.\n*   Thus, they find it difficult to develop faith toward either the scriptures or the God-realized Saints.\n\n### Rajo Guṇa: The Mode of Passion\n\nIn the mode of passion, the souls are impelled toward intense activity. Their attachment to the world and preference for pleasure, prestige, wealth, and bodily comforts, propels them to work hard in the world for achieving these goals, which they consider to be the most important in life.\n\n### Rajo Guṇa: Increasing Attraction and Lust\n\nRajo guṇa increases the attraction between man and woman, and generates kām (lust). To satiate that lust, man and woman enter into the relationship of marriage and have a home. The upkeep of the home creates the need for wealth, so they begin to work hard for economic development. They engage in intense activity, but each action creates karmas, which further bind them in material existence.\n\n### Tamo Guṇa: The Mode of Ignorance\n\nThe mode of ignorance clouds the intellect of the living being. The desire for happiness now manifests in perverse manners.\n\n*   For example, everyone knows that cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Every cigarette pack carries a warning to that extent issued by the government authorities.\n*   Cigarette smokers read this, and yet do not refrain from smoking. This happens because the intellect loses its discriminative power and does not hesitate to inflict self-injury to get the pleasure of smoking.\n*   As someone jokingly said, “A cigarette is a pipe with a fire at one end and a fool at the other.” That is the influence of tamo guṇa, which binds the soul in the darkness of ignorance."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Three Guñas: The Oscillation of Temperament**\n\nShree Krishna now explains how the same individual's temperament oscillates amongst the three guñas. These three guñas are present in the material energy, and our mind is made from the same energy. Hence, all the three guñas are present in our mind as well.\n\n### Comparing Guñas to Wrestlers\n\nThey can be compared to three wrestlers competing with each other. Each keeps throwing the others down, and so, sometimes the first is on top, sometimes the second, and sometimes the third. In the same manner, the three guñas keep gaining dominance over the individual's temperament, which oscillates amongst the three modes.\n\n### Factors Influencing Guña Dominance\n\nDepending upon the external environment, the internal contemplation, and the sanskārs (tendencies) of past lives, one or the other guña begins to dominate. There is no rule for how long it stays—one guña may dominate the mind and intellect for as short as a moment or for as long as an hour.\n\n### The Effects of Each Guña\n\n#### Sattva Guña Dominance\n\nIf sattva guña dominates, one becomes:\n\n*   Peaceful\n*   Content\n*   Generous\n*   Kind\n*   Helpful\n*   Serene\n*   Tranquil\n\n#### Rājasic Guña Dominance\n\nWhen rājasic guña gains prominence, one becomes:\n\n*   Passionate\n*   Agitated\n*   Ambitious\n*   Envious of others' success\n*   Develops a gusto for sense pleasures\n\n#### Tamo Guña Dominance\n\nWhen tamo guña becomes prominent, one is overcome by:\n\n*   Sleep\n*   Laziness\n*   Hatred\n*   Anger\n*   Resentment\n*   Violence\n*   Doubt\n\n### Real-Life Application of Guñas\n\nFor example, let us suppose you are sitting in your library, engaged in study. There is no worldly disturbance, and your mind has become sāttvic. After finishing your study, you sit in your living room and switch on the television. Seeing all the images makes your mind rājasic, and increases your hankering for sense pleasures. While you are watching your favorite channel, your family member comes and changes the channel. This disturbance causes tamo guña to increase in your mind, and you are filled with anger. In this way, the mind sways amongst the three guñas and adopts their qualities.\n\n### The Oscillation of Temperament\n\nIn this way, the same individual's temperament oscillates amongst the three guñas and adopts their qualities. This understanding helps us to better comprehend our own minds and emotions, allowing us to make necessary adjustments to achieve balance and harmony."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Three Guṇas**\n=====================================\n\n### Introduction to the Three Guṇas\n\nShree Krishna once again repeats how the three modes (guṇas) influence one's thinking.\n\n### The Three Guṇas\n\n*   **Attva Guṇa**: Attiva guṇa leads to the development of virtues and the illumination of knowledge.\n*   **Rajo Guṇa**: Rajo guṇa leads to greed, inordinate activity for worldly attainments, and restlessness of the mind.\n*   **Tamo Guṇa**: Tamo guṇa results in delusion of the intellect, laziness, and inclination toward intoxication and violence.\n\n### Influence on Spiritual Attitudes\n\nIn fact, these modes even influence our attitudes toward God and the spiritual path. When the mode of goodness becomes prominent, we may think: \"I have received so much grace from my Guru. I should endeavor to progress rapidly in my sādhanā, since the human form is precious and it should not be wasted in mundane pursuits.\"\n\nWhen the mode of passion becomes prominent, we may think: \"I must surely progress on the spiritual path, but what is the hurry? At present, I have many responsibilities to discharge, and they are more important.\"\n\nWhen the mode of ignorance dominates, we may think: \"I am not really sure if there is any God or not, for no one has ever seen him. So why waste time in sādhanā?\" Notice how the same person's thoughts have oscillated from such heights to the depths of devotion.\n\n### Understanding the Natural Fluctuation\n\nFor the mind to fluctuate due to the three guṇas is very natural.

All the living entities in the world are under the grip of the three guṇas, and hence the guṇas are the active agents in all the works being done in the world. But the Supreme Lord is beyond them. Therefore, he is called tri-guṇātīt (transcendental to the modes of material nature).\n\n**The Nature of the Supreme Lord**\n-----------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, all the attributes of God—his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, saints—are also tri-guṇātīt.\n\n### The Effect of Attachment on the Mind\n-----------------------------------------\n\nHowever, if we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the three guṇas, it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect. But if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends the guṇas and becomes divine.\n\n**The Path to Spiritual Growth**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThose who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, through bhakti (devotional service), with God and the Guru. This enables them to transcend the three guṇas, and attain the divine nature of God.\n\n**Further Elaboration**\n-----------------------\n\nThis is further elaborated in verse 14.26."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Three Modes of Nature**\n\n14.20 If we drink water from a dirty well, we are bound to get a stomach upset. Similarly, if we are influenced by the three modes, we are bound to experience their consequences, which are repeated birth within the material realm, disease, old age, and death. These four are the primary miseries of material life. It was by seeing these that the Buddha first realized that the world is a place of misery, and then searched for the way out of misery.\n\n**The Four Primary Miseries of Material Life**\n\n* Repeated birth within the material realm\n* Disease\n* Old age\n* Death\n\n**The Concept of Dharma**\n\nThe Vedas prescribe a number of codes of conduct, social duties, rituals, and regulations for human beings. These prescribed duties and codes of conduct are together called **karm dharma**, or **varṇāśhram**.\n\n\n### Dharma\nor \nŚhārīrik\n\n\nDharma\n\nThey help elevate us from **tamo guṇa** and **rajo guṇa** to **sattva guṇa**. However, to reach **sattva guṇa** is not enough; it is also a form of bondage.\n\n### The Three Modes of Nature\n\nThe three modes of nature are **tamo guṇa** (darkness), **rajo guṇa** (light), and **sattva guṇa** (pureness). The mode of goodness can be equated to being fettered with chains of gold. Our goal lies even beyond it—to get out of the prison house of material existence.\n\n**Transcending the Three Modes**\n\nShree Krishna explains that when we transcend the three modes, then Maya no longer binds the living being. Thus, the soul gets released from the cycle of life and death and attains immortality. Factually, the soul is always immortal. However, its identification with the material body makes it suffer the illusion of birth and death.\n\n**The Illusion of Birth and Death**\n\nThis illusory experience is against the eternal nature of the soul, which seeks release from it. Hence, the material illusion is naturally discomforting to our inner being and, from within, we all seek the taste of immortality.\n\n**The Ultimate Goal**\n\nOur ultimate goal lies in transcending the cycle of birth and death, and attaining immortality. This can be achieved by letting go of the three modes of nature and identifying with our true, eternal nature as a living being."

The above verse indicates that mere knowledge of the self and its distinction with the body is not enough.\n\n### The Role of Bhakti Yog\nWith the help of bhakti yog, the mind has to be fixed on the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna. Then alone will the mind become nirguṇa (untouched by the three modes), just as Shree Krishna is nirguṇa.\n\n### The Debate on Attachment to the Personal Form of God\nMany people are of the view that if the mind is fixed upon the personal form of God, it will not rise to the transcendental platform. Only when it is attached to the formless Brahman, will the mind become transcendental to the modes of material nature. However, this verse refutes such a view.\n\n### Refuting the Debate\nAlthough the personal form of God possesses infinite guṇas (qualities), these are all divine and beyond the modes of material nature. Hence, the personal form of God is also nirguṇa (beyond the three material modes).\n\n### Sage Ved Vyas' Explanation\nyastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥ\nprākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate\n(Padma Purāṇ)[v3]\n“Wherever the scriptures refer to God as nirguṇa (without attributes), they mean that he is without material attributes. Nevertheless, his divine personality is not devoid of qualities—he possesses infinite divine attributes.”\n\n### The Proper Object of Meditation\nThis verse also reveals the proper object of meditation. Transcendental meditation does not mean to meditate upon nothingness. The entity transcendental to the three modes of material nature is God. And so, only when the object of our meditation is God can it truly be called transcendental meditation."

Here, Shree Krishna reveals that the Brahman which the jñānīs worship is the light from the personal form of God.\n\n**The Teachings of Padma Purāṇ**\n\nPadma Purāṇ states:\n\nyannakhenduruchirbrahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥ\nguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram\n(Patal Khand 77.60)[v4]\n\n**Transcendental Brahman**\n\n“This light that emanates from the toe nails of the feet of the Lord of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna, is the transcendental Brahman that the jñānīs and even the celestial gods meditate upon.” Similarly, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:\n\ntāñhāra aṅgera śhuddha kiraṇa-maṇḍala\nupaniṣhat kahe tāñre brahma sunirmala\n(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela 2.12) [v5]\n\n**The Upaniṣhads' Description of Brahman**\n\n“The effulgence emanating from the divine body of God is described by the Upaniṣhads as Brahman.” Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna unequivocally confirms that the panacea for the disease of the three guṇas is to engage in unwavering devotion to the personal form of the Supreme Lord."

    "explanation": "**The Eternal Aśhvatth Tree**\n=====================================\n\nLord Shree Krishna speaks of the eternal \nAśhvatth\n tree, which is an upside-down \npeepal\n (sacred fig) tree with its roots above and branches below. \n\n**Definition of Aśhvatth**\n-------------------------\n\nAśhvatth \nalso means; which will not remain the same even on the next day or something which is constantly changing. The Sanskrit word for the world, \nSansar \nis defined in the Sanskrit dictionary as \nsansaratīti sansāraḥ; \nsomething that is constantly shifting. Another Sanskrit word for the world \nJagat \nis also defined as \ngachchhatīti jagat, \nthat means it is a constantly moving world.\n\n**The Constantly Changing World**\n------------------------------------\n\nThe world is not just moving or constantly changing, but someday it will be completely destroyed and reverted unto God. Therefore, the world we live in is temporary, or \nAśhvatth.\n\n**The Tree as a Symbol of the Material World**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lord explains that this material world is like a huge \nAśhvatth \ntree for the soul. Its roots are going upwards (\nūrdhva-mūlam\n) originating from God; nourished and supported by Him. The trunk and branches which are extending downwards (\nadhaḥ-śhākham\n) encompass all the life-forms from different abodes of the material realm. Its leaves are the Vedic mantras (\nchhandānsi\n), which describe rituals, ceremonies, and its reward.\n\n**The Cycle of Life and Death**\n---------------------------------\n\nBy performing such rituals, the soul can ascend to the heavenly abodes and enjoy celestial pleasures, but eventually, when the rewards deplete, they have to fall back to earth. In this way, the leaves of the \nAśhvatth\n tree nourish the material existence of the souls and perpetuate the continuous cycle of life and death.\n\n**Continuity of Life and Death**\n---------------------------------\n\nDue to this continuity, the beginning and the end are not experienced by the souls. Hence, this tree form of the world is \nAvyayam \nor eternal. As the water from the oceans evaporates forming clouds that rain the earth, which then forms rivers, and eventually flows back to the oceans. Likewise, the cycle of life and death is also continuous.\n\n**References in the Vedas**\n---------------------------\n\nThe Vedas also mention this tree:\n\n### Kaṭhopaniṣhad 2.3.1\n\n“ūrdhvamūlo ’vākśhākha eṣho ’śhvatthaḥ sanātanaḥ” \n(The eternal Aśhvatth tree with its roots upward and branches downward)\n\n### Taittirīya Āraṇyak 1.11.5\n\n“ūrdhvamūlaṁ arvākśhākhaṁ vṛikṣhaṁ yo samprati \nna sa jātu janaḥ śhraddhayātmṛityutyurmā mārayaditi” \n(Those who know this tree with its roots upward and branches downward will not believe that death can finish them)\n\n**The Intention of Describing the Aśhvatth Tree**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe intention of describing this tree in the Vedas was to make us understand that, we are beyond the cycle of life and death, and we should work towards cutting this tree down. For the same purpose, Lord Shree Krishna has mentioned that one who understands the secret (of cutting) this tree of \nsamsara\n is the knower of the Vedas (\nveda vit\n)."

    "explanation": "**The Human Form: A Tree of Karma**\n====================================================\n\n### The Trunk and Branches of the Human Form\n\nLord Krishna explains how the human form is similar to the aśhvatth tree. In this form, the soul performs karmas, which is the trunk of the tree. The branches (śhākhās) extend both upward (ūrddhva) and downward (adhaḥ). Based on how the soul performs in its past and present forms, it is reborn.\n\n### The Upright and Downward Paths\n\nIf the soul led a virtuous life, when reborn, it moves to the upward branches which denote the celestial abodes of the gandharvas, devatās, etc. In contrast, if a soul was involved in sinful acts, in the next birth, it gets degraded to the downward branches, which are for the nether regions and animal species.\n\n### Irrigating the Tree of Material Existence\n\nThe three modes of material nature (the three gunas) irrigate this eternal tree of material existence. The sense objects generated by these gunas are like buds on the tree (viṣhaya-pravālāḥ), which sprout causing further growth. These buds sprout creating several aerial roots of material desires.\n\n### Aerial Roots and Desires\n---------------------------\n\nJust like the aerial roots of a tree, which grow straight from the branches down to the ground and with time become secondary trunks, making the tree huge, covering a large area. For example, \"The Great Banyan\" in the Botanical Garden of Kolkata is one of the largest known banyan trees, spread across a vast area of about 4.7 acres, with over 3700 aerial roots and a crown circumference of about 486 meters.\n\n### The Bud-like Sense Objects\n---------------------------\n\nIn the context of the material world, the sense objects are like the buds on the aśhvatth tree, which sprout into aerial roots as they evoke desires of bodily pleasures in a person. To satiate these desires, a living being performs karma. However, these desires are unending and keep increasing; similar to the aerial roots, which provide nourishment to this metaphorical tree, causing its unlimited expansion. Eventually, the soul gets further entangled into this web of material consciousness.\n\n**The Endless Cycle of Karma**\n------------------------------\n\nThe three modes of material nature (the three gunas) create an endless cycle of karma, where the soul becomes further entangled in material consciousness. The desire for bodily pleasures and other material attachments continue to grow, just like the aerial roots of a tree, leading to an endless cycle of birth and rebirth."

    "explanation": "**The Mysterious Tree of Material Existence**\n\nShree Krishna explains that the mystery of the aśhvatth tree is not easy to understand for the embodied souls. The buds of the tree, which are the objects of the senses, lure them into developing desires.\n\n**The Cycle of Desire and Suffering**\n\nIgnorant souls keep working hard towards fulfilling these desires, which only keep increasing and nourish the tree to grow further. When such desires are fulfilled, they return with double the intensity forming greed. But when obstructed, it causes anger, which fogs the intellect and further deepens the ignorance.\n\n**The Soul's Forgetfulness**\n\nIn the bodily form, the soul only thinks of itself to be the person in flesh and bones. It is forgetful of its origin and its eternal existence. It identifies itself with its human name, family, country, etc.\n\n**The Pursuit of Material Happiness**\n\nThus, to satisfy the bodily needs and in quest of material happiness, the living being gets involved in unfruitful endeavors. Sometimes to satiate one’s materialistic desires knowingly or unknowingly a human being commits sins.\n\n**The Consequences of Sins**\n\nThese cause it to move downward and it is reborn in the lower species and nether regions. Whereas, sometimes it gets attracted towards the leaves of this tree, which are the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas.\n\n**The Accumulation of Pious Merits**\n\nThese help in accumulating pious merits. The propensity of material pleasures drives the human being to involve in such pious activities.\n\n**The Cycle Continues**\n\nThe pious merits help the soul move upward in the celestial abodes, but once these merits deplete, it is sent back to the lower forms, and this cycle continues.\n\n**The Wisdom of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu**\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu said: \"Since the soul is forgetful of God since eternity, the material energy is subjecting it to worldly miseries. Sometimes, it lifts the soul to the celestial abodes, and other times it drops it down to the hellish regions.\"\n\n**The Analogy of Torture**\n\nThis is akin to the torture meted by kings in olden times. In the olden days, some kings ordered a very torturous punishment, wherein a person’s head was immersed into the water almost till suffocation, then released for a few gasps, again put back into the water, and was repeated.\n\n**The Tree of Material Existence**\n\nThe condition is similar for a soul trapped in the tree of material existence, it is pushed back and forth between the upper and lower regions according to its merits.\n\n**The Temporary Relief**\n\nWhen born in the celestial forms, it enjoys some temporary relief, which fades soon and the soul gets dropped back to the human form.\n\n**The Suffering of Millions of Years**\n\nSeveral lifetimes have passed, and the soul continues to work towards material enjoyment. This has caused the tree to expand its roots of desire farther and has become huge.\n\n**The Cutting Down of the Tree**\n\nYet, this tree can be cut with dispassion says, Lord Shree Krishna.\n\n**The Remedy of Detachment**\n\nThe remedy for the soul’s never-ending suffering is asaṅg, which means detachment. The axe of detachment can cut the roots of desires which are nourished by the three modes of material nature.\n\n**The Development of Detachment**\n\nThe Lord further explains that this axe of detachment can only be developed with the knowledge of the self. One has to realize that, \"I am not this material body, but an eternal spiritual being.\n\n**The Pursuit of Eternal Happiness**\n\nThe everlasting happiness that I pursue cannot be achieved with material things. My endeavors towards gratification of the material desires of this material body have no satiation, they are only getting me further trapped in the samsara or the web of life and death.\n\n**The Withering of the Tree**\n\nWith detachment, one can stop further growth of the tree roots, and due to lack of nourishment, the tree starts to wither.\n\n**The Base of the Tree**\n\nThe next step is to look for the base of this upside-down tree, which in real terms is on the top and much higher than everything else. It’s here that the Supreme Lord of all creation resides.\n\n**The Ultimate Source**\n\nAs Lord Shree Krishna had earlier mentioned, \"I am the origin of all creation. Everything proceeds from Me.\"\n\n**The Path to Ultimate Liberation**\n\nTherefore, to find the ultimate source, we must surrender to God as explained in this verse: \"I submit unto Him from whom the universe came into being a long time ago.\"\n\n**The Overcoming of Maya**\n\nHowever, in an earlier verse Shree Krishna has also said that, \"My divine energy, Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto Me cross over it easily.\"\n\n**The Path of Total Surrender**\n\nTherefore, the only way to cut down the aśhvatth tree is by totally surrendering to the Supreme Lord and taking his refuge.\n\n**The Reward of Total Surrender**\n\nBy doing this, we will not return to this material world, and after death will go to His divine Abode.\n\n**The Requirements for Total Surrender**\n\nIn the next verse, Shree Krishna has revealed the requirements for the process of surrender."

    "explanation": "**Understanding the Nature of Embodied Souls**\n\n### Are Embodied Souls a Part of God?\n\nTo understand this concept, we must first explore the different forms in which God manifests. There are mainly two forms:\n\n#### **Swānśh**\n\nAll the direct forms of God, who are His integrated parts and not different from Lord Shree Krishna, are called **swānśh**. These forms are also known as His Avatars, such as Shree Ram, Narshingh Bhagavan, Varaha, Matsya, etc.\n\n#### **Vibhinnānśh**\n\nAll the souls of existence come under this category; they are not directly His parts. These take form from His material energy or **jīva śhakti**.\n\nShree Krishna had previously explained this in Verse 7.5:\n\n“Beyond the material energy, O mighty-armed Arjun, there is another superior energy of Mine. It is the embodied souls who are the basis of life in this world.”\n\nThese **vibhinnānśh** souls are further divided into three kinds:\n\n### **Nitya Siddha**\n\nThe liberated souls, who have always resided in the divine realm of God since eternity and participate in His divine Pastimes.\n\n### **Sādhan Siddha**\n\nThose souls from the material world, who practiced **sādhanā** and attained the Supreme Lord. And now they reside in the divine realm for the rest of eternity.\n\n### **Nitya Baddha**\n\nThe embodied souls who have been trapped in the material realm since eternity. Due to their material existence, these souls are dis-illusioned by their five senses and the mind. They are struggling in **samsara**; the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:\n\n“Parāñchi khāni vyatṛiṇat swayambhūḥ” (2.1.1)\n\nThe creator, Brahma, has made the senses such that they are turned outward toward the world.\n\nTherefore, Shree Krishna said for the **vibhinnānśh nitya baddha** parts, “Bound by their material nature, these souls are struggling with the six senses including the mind.” In the next verse, He explains when a soul moves from one body to another upon death, what happens to the mind and the senses."

Similar to the breeze, which carries with it the fragrances of the flowers, upon the death of the gross body, the soul carries with it the subtle and the causal bodies, these include the senses and the mind.\n\n**What Does the Soul Carry with It?**\n------------------------------------\n\nThe concept of three kinds of bodies has been explained in detail in Verse 2.28.\n\n### The Soul's Journey After Death\n\nEven when the material body dies, the soul continues to carry the mind along with the experiences of its past lifetimes from its former body to the new one. That explicates why people who are born blind can still dream, probably based on their experiences from past lives.\n\n**The Nature of Dreams**\n------------------------\n\nDreams are considered to be a visual representation of what we see or think during waking hours. It might be in a distorted or rambled form, which gets connected in our mind when we sleep.\n\n**A Blind Person's Dreams**\n---------------------------\n\nFor example, someone saw a bird flying and thought, “How wonderful will it be to fly like a bird!” Sometime later, he dreams that he is flying in his human body itself. Yet, a blind person who has not seen anything from birth dreams, this can only be due to all the impressions that are stored in the subconscious mind, which it carries with it from past lifetimes.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Explanation**\n------------------------------\n\nIn the next verse, Shree Krishna explains what the soul does with the mind and senses it takes with it when it departs from its present body."

The mind and senses are lifeless, but due to the consciousness of the soul, they become lifelike. This helps them experience pleasure and pain from thoughts, situations, persons, and objects of the senses.\n\n**The Ego's Role in Desiring Material Pleasures**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, the happiness experienced through the mind and senses is material. The soul is divine, but it can never be satisfied with such material pleasures. This leads to restlessness and an endless search for the ultimate source of happiness.\n\n**Philosophical Insights**\n-------------------------\n\n*   Ralph Waldo Emerson, an American philosopher, asks: \"We grant that human life is mean. But how did we find out that it is mean? What is the ground of this uneasiness, of this old discontent?\"\n*   Meister Eckhart writes: \"There is something in the soul which is above the living being, divine and simple. This light is only satisfied with the supra essential essence.\"\n*   These philosophical insights highlight the fine innuendo of the soul's enormous claim on happiness.\n\n**Attaining Divine Bliss**\n-------------------------\n\nThe divine bliss, which is both eternal and infinite, can only be attained from God. Those who realize that the mind and senses are the cause of bondage and understand the need to turn them towards God progress on the path of devotion.\n\n**Saint Tulsidas' Journey**\n-------------------------\n\n*   As a young lad, Saint Tulsidas was madly in love with his wife.\n*   He decided to go meet her, despite the bad weather and his fears of being caught.\n*   His intense desire blinded his mind, and he mistakenly thought a rope was a log when crossing the stream.\n*   He then found himself alone with his wife, and she scolded him for his foolishness.\n*   However, her words had a life-changing effect on Tulsidas. He renounced his household life and took up devotion.\n*   By detaching himself from material pleasures and engaging them towards devotion to God, Tulsidas became a great saint and poet.\n\n**Tulsidas' Poem**\n-----------------\n\n*   \"As a lustful man desires a beautiful woman, and as an avaricious person desires wealth, may my mind and senses constantly desire Lord Ram.\"\n*   This poem highlights Tulsidas' newfound devotion to God and his understanding that true happiness can only be attained from the divine.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nThe human quest for happiness is a complex and multifaceted one. The soul's desire for material pleasures can lead to restlessness and a never-ending search for fulfillment. However, by recognizing the true nature of happiness and turning our senses towards God, we can attain divine bliss and find our ultimate source of joy."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of the Soul**\n=====================================\n\n### A Philosophical Explanation\n\n15.10 The soul savors the perceptions of the mind and the senses while it resides within a body, but not everyone can understand this. It is a spiritual object and cannot be seen or touched using material senses. Several experiments have been conducted by scientists to find the soul, but the material instruments of the laboratories are no good to detect it. Hence, they conclude that all the bodily parts working together are the source of life.\n\n**An Analogy to Understand the Concept**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIt is similar to a newbie mechanic trying to figure out how does a car move. He looks at the movement of the wheels, traces that back to the accelerator, then the steering wheel and the ignition switch. He concludes that all these parts make a car move. But he missed the important part, who starts the ignition and moves the steering wheel? Unless a driver operates the car, it would not move.\n\n**Applying this Analogy to Human Physiology**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, devoid of spiritual knowledge about the existence of the soul and its functions, the physiologists’ theory is that the physical body itself along with its different parts is the source of life.\n\n**A Verse from the Bhagavad Gita**\n-------------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna has said that the ignorant (vimūḍh) are unaware of their own divine identity and presume the physical body to be the self. Only someone who has acquired spiritual knowledge understands that it is the soul that gives life to the body. Without the soul, the body is lifeless. When a person dies, the material parts of the body; the heart, brain, lungs, limbs, etc. are there, but they don’t function, as the soul has left the body.\n\n**The Role of Consciousness**\n------------------------------\n\nConsciousness is an indication of life or the presence of a soul in a physical body. When the soul departs, consciousness ends. Only those who have acquired the eyes of knowledge (jñāna chakṣhu) can understand this phenomenon.\n\n**The Understanding Required**\n-------------------------------\n\nOnly those who have acquired spiritual knowledge and understanding can see beyond the physical body and recognize that it is the soul that gives life to the body. Without this understanding, we will continue to see our physical bodies as the source of life, even though it is a false assumption."

We want to decide the correctness and faults in knowledge with our intellect, which has only worldly but no experience of the divine. We believe that things which cannot be perceived by the mind and the senses do not exist.\n\n**A Scientific Perspective**\n-------------------------\n\nThis approach is well elucidated by Noble laureate and French physiologist, Alexis Carrel. In his book, Man the Unknown, he states:\n\n> \"Our mind has a natural tendency to reject the things that do not fit into the frame of scientific or philosophical beliefs of our time. After all, scientists are only human. They are saturated with the prejudices of their environment and epoch. They willingly believe that facts which cannot be explained by current theories do not exist. At present times, scientists still look upon telepathy and other metaphysical phenomena as illusions. Evident facts having an unorthodox appearance are suppressed.\"\n\n**The Logic of a Well-Frog**\n------------------------\n\nAccording to Nyāya Darśhan, one of the ancient schools of Hindu philosophy, such thinking is called **kūpa-maṇḍūka-nyāya** (the logic of a well-frog). The story behind this is of a frog which has been living within the walls of a well, unaware of the world outside.\n\n**The Story of the Well-Frog**\n-----------------------------\n\nOnce an ocean frog gets washed off and falls into that well. The well-frog enquires to the newcomer, \"How big is the ocean, where you lived?\" The ocean frog replied, \"It is huge.\" The well-frog said, \"It must be 5 times bigger than this well.\" To this, the ocean frog said, \"No much bigger than that.\" The well-frog said, \"Is it 10 times bigger?\" To this, the ocean frog replied, \"Much more than that.\" The well-frog was now curious and said, \"A hundred times?\" To this, the ocean frog replied, \"A hundred is nothing, the ocean is much bigger than that.\" The frog from the well did not believe the ocean frog and said, \"You are a liar, how can any place be a hundred times bigger than my well?\" The well-frog had been living there its whole life, it had not seen anything beyond the walls of that well. Therefore, its mind could not comprehend the idea of a vast ocean, or the world that existed outside of that well.\n\n**A Lesson for Materialistic People**\n--------------------------------------\n\nLike the frog of the well, materialistic people cannot perceive the idea of an eternal soul. Due to their limited experience and lack of spiritual knowledge, they cannot perceive that there is an entire spiritual universe beyond the understanding of their material intellects. Only those who have taken the path of spirituality, endeavor to purify their hearts with humility and faith. A cleansed mind naturally experiences the presence of the soul. Then the knowledge of the scriptures becomes clear to them.\n\n**The Imperfection of Senses**\n------------------------------\n\nSimilar to the existence of the soul, the senses cannot perceive the existence of God as well. Only through the eyes of knowledge can one realize God. In the next verse, Shree Krishna has briefed on the method of perceiving the existence of God."

    "explanation": "**The True Nature of the Universe**\n=====================================\n\nIn the human form, we tend to forget our origin and eternal form. We regard ourselves as the physical body and get attracted to our bodily relations; parents, spouse, children, material wealth, etc. We feel they are the most significant. We also forget that it is God who is the creator and sustainer of the entire universe.\n\n**The Creation of the Universe**\n-------------------------------\n\nIn this verse, Lord Shree Krishna has said that the entire creation; is the manifestation of his energy. Even the Sun gets its radiance from him. According to scientific theories, the energy emitted every second by the sun is equivalent to millions of nuclear power plants put together, and it has been an uninterrupted process for billions of years. Yet this energy has not reduced in any way.\n\n**The Glory of the Sun and Moon**\n--------------------------------\n\nSimilarly, the night sky is lit up by the moon. Though our mundane intellect might want us to believe and it is also scientifically concluded that moonshine is due to the reflection of the sun's light. But the periodic movement of the moon is also part of God’s amazing creation.\n\n**The Panch Mahabhootas and Universal Manifestation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sun, the moon, the planets, stars, and the five elements of nature (panch mahabhootas: earth, water, air, fire, and ether); in fact, the entire universe is a manifestation of God’s vibhūtis (opulence). It would be very naïve to think that such an amazing celestial arrangement is a result of some random big bang.\n\n**A Story from the Kenopanishad**\n-------------------------------\n\nThere is a story in Kenopanishad, which explicates this. Once there was a prolonged war between the devatās (celestial gods) and the daityas (demons from the nether regions). Eventually, the devatās won by the grace of God. But their pride made them think that it was due to their own strength.\n\n**The Yaksha and the Gods**\n-------------------------\n\nGod wanted to teach them a lesson; He manifested as an effulgent and powerful yakṣha (a semi-celestial being) in the celestial sky. When Indra, the King of Heaven saw this yakṣha, he felt insecure and intimidated. To find out who this yakṣha was, he sent Agni, the fire god.\n\n**Challenges from Agni and Vayu**\n-------------------------------\n\nAgni put in front of him a piece of straw and asked if he could burn it. Agni laughed, \"Can a blade of grass be a test for my immense power? Let that be.\" But when he moved forward to burn it, he could not and started feeling very cold himself. God had taken away his power.\n\n**Challenges from Vayu**\n------------------------\n\nNext, Indra sent Vayu, the wind god to inquire who this yakṣha was. He went to the yakṣha and said, \"I am the wind god and possess the power to turn the world upside down within a few seconds, reveal who you are?\" Again, the yakṣha put a piece of straw in front of Vayu and said, \"Turn this over if you can?\" Vayu smirked with pride and tried to blow it, but could not.\n\n**The Supreme Father Revealed**\n------------------------------\n\nNow Indra was raged and came to challenge the yakṣha himself. But by then the yakṣha had disappeared and in his place was seated Goddess Uma, God’s divine Yogmaya power. A baffled Indra asked her, \"O Divine Mother, please tell me who was that powerful yakṣha?\"\n\n**The Lesson Learned**\n---------------------\n\nShe answered, \"O imprudent child, you could not recognize Him? Your pride had blinded your prudence. He was your Supreme Father, your creator, and power source, without him you would be powerless.\" Realizing his mistake, Indra begged for forgiveness."

    "explanation": "**The Earth's Habitable Conditions**\n=====================================\n\n### A Big Mass of Matter\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna has said that it is His energy which has brought about the appropriate physical conditions for life to exist on planet earth. Here, \ngām\n means earth, and \nojasā\n is energy. Like all other celestial bodies, the earth is also a big mass of matter. But God has made it habitable, so that, it can sustain life.\n\n### The Role of Ocean Water\n\nEver wondered, why ocean water is so salty? God could have made the oceans full of freshwater, but it would have become a breeding ground for diseases. Due to the high salt content of the ocean water, many disease-causing microorganisms cannot survive in it, thereby protecting life.\n\n### Habitable Conditions for Various Species\n\nSimilarly, several such amazing phenomena make earth inhabitable to a variety of species, of both movable, and static living beings.\n\n**Life on Earth Would be Impossible**\n-----------------------------------\n\nNobel laureate and famous American scientist, George Wald has written in his book, A Universe that Breeds Life: “If anyone of the considerable number of the physical properties of our universe were other than they are, then life, that now appears to be so prevalent, would be impossible, here or anywhere.”\n\n### Nourishing the Plant Life\n\nShree Krishna also says that the moonlight gets its nourishing properties from Him. And it is the ambrosial nectar of the moonlight that nourishes the entire plant life, i.e. fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, etc.\n\n### Key Points\n-----------------\n\n*   The earth is a big mass of matter.\n*   God has made it habitable for life to sustain.\n*   Ocean water is salty due to high salt content, protecting life from disease-causing microorganisms.\n*   Various phenomena make the earth inhabitable to different species.\n*   Changes in physical properties of the universe would make life impossible."

    "explanation": "**The Vaiśhvānara and the Digestive Process**\n=====================================================\n\nShree Krishna explains that God exists inside all living beings as vaiśhvānara, meaning \"fire of digestion,\" which is ignited by the power of God. This concept is further supported by the Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad, which states:\n\n\"God is the fire inside the stomach that enables living beings to digest food.\" (5.9.1)\n\n**A Naïve Approach**\n--------------------\n\nThe scientific community has concluded that the organs of the digestive system, such as the stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, etc., secrete digestive juices enabling the digestion of food in living beings. However, this revelation by God suggests that such an approach is naïve. It is God's energy which fires up the digestive process in living beings.\n\n**Categorizing Food**\n--------------------\n\nChaturvidham means four types, and annam means food. Food is categorized into four types:\n\n*   **Bhojya**: Foods that are chewed, such as bread, chapatti, etc.\n*   **Peya**: Foods that are mostly liquid or semi-solid, which we have to swallow or drink, such as milk, juice, etc.\n*   **Kośhya**: Foods that are sucked, such as sugarcane.\n*   **Lehya**: This includes foods that are licked, such as honey, etc.\n\n**God's Support**\n-----------------\n\nIn the last few verses, Shri Krishna has explicated how God supports every aspect of our life. With his energy, He makes the earth habitable, nourishes all vegetation, and even ignites the gastric fire to digest our food.\n\n**God as Master of All Knowledge**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn the next verse, Shri Krishna concludes by stating that He is the master of all knowledge."

    "explanation": "**The Power of Human Memory and Knowledge**\n=====================================================\n\nIn this verse, Lord Shree Krishna says that He has bestowed upon us this amazing ability of memory and knowledge. While the mind and the intellect are like software; the brain can be considered hardware. Yet this mechanism of the brain is way beyond human understanding.\n\n**The Limitations of Human Understanding**\n----------------------------------------\n\nAlthough there is vast development in technology, there are many areas where the scientific community is still struggling. For example, surgeons who perform brain transplant get delighted with their feat; but do not fully understand its functions. Another example is of face-recognition technology. It is remarkable that humans can very easily recognize someone they meet after several years, even though there are many changes in their looks. Whereas, present-day computers sometimes cannot even recognize unchanged faces.\n\n**The Mysteries of the Human Brain**\n-------------------------------------\n\nHow amazing it is that while the scanner software finds it difficult to read even typewritten text; humans can read even sketchy handwritings, without much effort. Such are the mysteries of the human brain which the Supreme Lord has created.\n\n**The Power of Forgetting**\n-------------------------\n\nShree Krishna says that He has also given us this power of forgetting the past. Similar to how unwanted records are deleted from a computer, living beings wipe off unwanted memories. Else there would be an information overload.\n\n**Uddhav's Question**\n-------------------\n\ntvatto jñānaṁ hi jīvānāṁ pramoṣhas te ’tra śhaktitaḥ\n(Bhagavatam 11.22.28)\n\n\"From You alone, the knowledge of the living being arises, and by Your potency that knowledge is stolen away.\"\n\n**The Source of Knowledge**\n-------------------------\n\nOther than the internal knowledge that we carry, there is another source of knowledge; that is from the scriptures. In this verse, the Lord has further revealed his glories in regards to the manifestation of the Vedas; that he is the creator, knower, and writer of the Vedas. God is divine and all his creations, including the Vedas, are divine.\n\n**Ved Vyas as an Avatar of God**\n---------------------------------\n\nthe author of the Vedānt Darśhan is considered to be an avatar of God. And Shree Krishna has specifically mentioned that he is the author of the Vedānt.\n\n**The Ultimate Objective of Knowledge**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nEventually, He says that although the Vedas give out numerous instructions both material and spiritual, the final objective of all knowledge is to know Him. The purpose of the rituals and ceremonies instructed are to lure people back from the material world towards spirituality. They act as an intermediate step to detach them from their materialistic mindset and direct them towards God.\n\n**The Kaṭhopaniṣhad**\n----------------------\n\nsarve vedā yat padamāmananti\n(Kaṭhopaniṣhad 1.2.15)\n\n\"All the Vedic mantras are actually pointing towards God.\" Memorizing and reciting the Vedic mantras in proper meter, following all the rituals, meditating or even awakening the kuṇḍalinī power; all will be worthless if we do not know God. Only those who have learned to truly love God, have understood the real teachings of all the Vedic scriptures.\n\n**Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj**\n----------------------------------\n\nsarva śhāstra sāra yaha govind rādhe, āṭhoṅ yām mana hari guru meṅ lagā de\n(Rādhā Govind Geet)\n\n\"The essence of all the scriptures is to engage your mind day and night in loving devotion to God and Guru.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nIn the next two verses, Shree Krishna has described the terms kṣhar, akṣhar, and Puruṣhottam and given proper perspective to the knowledge revealed so far."

    "explanation": "**The Two Kinds of Beings: Perishable and Imperishable**\n\nShree Krishna explains that there are two kinds of beings in the universe. The first kind is the **kṣhar**, which refers to perishable beings. These are all the living entities in the material realm, from the tiniest insect to the celestial gods.\n\n**Characteristics of Perishable Beings (kṣhar)**\n\n* All beings in the material realm are perishable.\n* They have to go through the repetitive cycle of birth and death of their material body.\n\n**The Cycle of Birth and Death**\n\n* Mayaa binds the individual soul to a material body in the material realm.\n* All embodied living entities in the material world are **kṣhar** (perishable).\n* This cycle of birth and death repeats infinitely.\n\n**The Exception: Imperishable Beings (akṣhar)**\n\n* The **akṣhar** souls possess an immortal body, free from the cycle of birth and death.\n* They reside forever in the divine realm, known as the Abode of God.\n\n**The Nature of Eternal Souls**\n\n* Although all souls are eternal, they are bound to the material realm by Mayaa.\n* The **akṣhar** souls, however, possess an immortal body that transcends the material realm.\n\nNote: This explanation uses Sanskrit words and concepts from Hindu philosophy, specifically the Bhagavad Gita."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Paramātma: The Supreme Divine Personality**\n\nIn the previous verses, Shree Krishna spoke about the different worlds and categories of souls. Now he speaks of God - the Supreme Divine Personality called the Paramātma, which means the Supreme Soul. The appellation of Param emphasizes on the fact that Paramātmā is different from ātmā, which is an individual soul, whereas Paramātmā is the Supreme Soul. He is the transcendental God who controls both the perishable and imperishable worlds.\n\n### Disapproval of Non-Dualistic Philosophies\n\nFor the non-dualistic philosophers who propagate that individual soul itself is the Supreme Soul, this verse is clear disapproval of their claim. While the individual soul is very tiny and confined to the material body it resides in; the Supreme Soul is present inside every living entity. He is the constant companion of the individual soul in every life, immaterial of what species the soul gets born into.\n\n**The Role of Paramātma in Granting Results**\n\nHe sits in their hearts quietly taking a note; keeping an account of their karmas, and gives appropriate results. For example, in a particular birth, a soul has received a dog's body. The Supreme Soul continues to be inside and gives results based on the soul's past karmas. This explains why even dogs have different destinies.\n\nSome dogs are born on the streets, live a famished life, and die in misery. Whereas, some get to live comfortably as pets in lavish mansions, living a dainty life. This huge difference in destiny is due to the stockpile of karmas from their previous births.\n\n**Paramātma's Existence in Personal Form**\n\nThe Supreme Soul which accompanies the soul in its various births, in different species, keeps granting results based on its karmas.\n\nThe Supreme Soul also exists in a personal form as the four-armed Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, commonly known as \"Bhagwan Vishnu\". A popular saying in Hindi goes:\n\n\"\"\"\nmārane vāle ke do hāth, bachāne vāle ke chār hāth\"\"\"\nwhich means, a killer has two arms, but the savior has four arms. The four-armed personality referred to here is the Paramātmā, the Supreme Soul.\n\n**Bhagwan Vishnu: A Form of Paramātma**\n\nThe four-armed personality referred to here is the Paramātmā, the Supreme Soul. This form of Paramātma symbolizes his ability to save and protect all living entities from the clutches of death."

    "explanation": "**Verse Explanation: Puruṣhottam and the Supreme Divine Personality**\n\n### 15.18 - The Source of All Magnificence\n\nSo far in this chapter, Shree Krishna has detailed that His opulence is the source of all the magnificence in nature, and in creating the visible universe he does not deplete Himself. In this verse, He has called Himself Puruṣhottam, the Divine Supreme Person who transcends over the material world, which includes both kṣhar (the perishable) and akṣhar (the imperishable) divine souls.\n\n### Clarifying the Concept of Puruṣhottam\n\nDoes that mean the Puruṣhottam He has referred to and Lord Shree Krishna Himself are two different entities? To eliminate any such doubts, in this verse, while referring to Himself Shree Krishna has used the term aham (I), which is first person singular. He also said that the Vedas and the Smritis have described Him similarly:\n\n**Quotes from the Upanishads**\n\n*   \"Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord. Meditate upon Him, relish the bliss of His devotion, worship Him, and serve Him.\" (Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad)\n*   \"Gopal (Lord Krishna) is the Supreme Being.\" (Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad)\n\n### The Nature of Lord Krishna\n\nThen the question arises, who are Lord Ram, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and all the other Gods and Goddesses? They are all different manifestations of the same Bhagavān, the Supreme Divine Personality and should not be considered separate.\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n*   Lord Krishna is the Puruṣhottam, the Divine Supreme Person who transcends over the material world.\n*   He is described as aham (I), first person singular, to clarify that He and Puruṣhottam are not two different entities.\n*   The Vedas and Smritis describe Lord Krishna similarly, emphasizing His Supreme Lord nature.\n*   All the other Gods and Goddesses, including Lord Ram, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva, are different manifestations of the same Bhagavān (Supreme Divine Personality)."

The followers of jñāna-yoga worship God as Brahman.\n*   **Paramātmā**: The Supreme Soul is said to reside in the hearts of all living creatures. The aṣhṭāṅg-yoga seeks God as Paramātmā.\n*   **Bhagavān**: This form is more personal and can be considered the sweetest among God's manifestations. The devotees of bhākti-yoga savor this form and immerse themselves in his loving bliss.\n\n### Which Form is the Most Complete?\n\nIn this chapter, Shree Krishna has described all three forms of God. But which of them is the most complete? Here, in this verse lies the answer.\n\nShree Krishna says those who know Him as the Supreme Divine Personality and worship him as Bhagavān truly have complete knowledge of Him.\n\n### Quote from Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj\n\nIn his book Bhakti Śhatak, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has given a detailed explanation of why Bhagavān realization is the highest.\n\nHe has quoted the same verse 1.2.11 of the Shreemad Bhagavatam and said:\n\n“Ved Vyas has declared that the Supreme Lord manifests in three ways—Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān.”"

    "explanation": "**The 26 Virtues of a Saintly Nature**\n=====================================\n\nShree Krishna describes twenty-six virtues of a saintly nature, which should be cultivated as part of our spiritual practice for elevating ourselves to the supreme goal.\n\n### 1. Fearlessness\n\nFearlessness is the state of freedom from concern for present and future miseries. Inordinate attachment to any kind causes fear.\n\n*   Attachment to wealth leads to dread of impoverishment.\n*   Attachment to social prestige causes fear of infamy.\n*   Attachment to vice leads to anxiety about the consequences of sin.\n*   Attachment to bodily comfort causes fear of ill-health, and so on.\n\nDetachment and surrender to God vanquish all fear from the heart.\n\n### 2. Purity of Mind\n\nPurity of mind is the state of inner cleanliness. The mind generates and harbors thoughts, sentiments, feelings, emotions, etc.\n\n*   When these are ethical, wholesome, positive, and uplifting, the mind is considered pure.\n*   When they are unethical and degrading, the mind is considered impure.\n\nAttachment to objects in the modes of passion and ignorance contaminate the mind.\nWhile attachment to God purifies it.\n\n### 3. Steadfastness in Spiritual Knowledge\n\nSteadfastness in spiritual knowledge is forged by remaining steadfast in the awareness of spiritual principles.\n\nAs Sri Aurobindo said, \"When human beings forget what is right and wrong, they become like animals.\"\n\nThe path of virtue requires mental poise.\n\n### 4. Charity\n\nCharity refers to the giving away of one's possessions for a good cause or to needy persons.\n\nTrue charity is that which is done with a sense of gratefulness to God for the opportunity to help.\n\nMaterial charity, done for the welfare of the body, helps others temporarily.\nSpiritual charity, done at the platform of the soul, helps eliminate the cause of all suffering, which is separation from God.\n\nConsequently, it is considered higher than material charity.\n\n### 5. Control of the Senses\n\nThe senses are notorious in their ability to drag the mind deeper into material illusion.\n\nThey tempt the living being to seek immediate gratification.\n\nHowever, walking the path of virtue requires forsaking the lower sensual pleasures for achieving the higher goal.\n\nThus, restraint of the senses is an essential virtue for treading the path to God.\n\n### 6. Sacrifice\n\nSacrifice is considered perfect when it is done for the pleasure of God.\n\nIt means executing one's Vedic duties and social obligations, even though they may not be enjoyable.\n\n### 7. Study of the Sacred Books\n\nThe study of the sacred books is an important aspect of cultivating the divine nature.\n\nWhen the intellect is illumined with proper knowledge, one's actions naturally become sublime.\n\n### 8. Austerity\n\nAusterity is the voluntary acceptance of hardships for purifying the body, mind, and intellect.\n\nThe body-mind-senses are such that if we pamper them, they become pleasure-seeking.\nIf we restrain them, they become disciplined.\n\nThus, austerity is the key to purifying the body, mind, and intellect.\n\n### 9. Straightforwardness\n\nStraightforwardness is simplicity in speech and conduct unclutters the mind.\n\nThe English phrase \"simple living, high thinking\" aptly expresses the benefits of the virtue of straightforwardness.\n\n### 10. Non-violence\n\nNon-violence means not impeding the progressive life of other living beings through thought, word, or deed.\n\nIt is a fundamental virtue that promotes peace and harmony in the world.\n\n### 11. Truthfulness\n\nTruthfulness means restraining oneself from distorting facts to suit one's purpose.\n\nGod is the Absolute Truth, and hence, the practice of truthfulness takes us toward him; on the other hand, falsehood, while convenient, takes us away from God.\n\n### 12. Absence of Anger\n\nThe manifestation of anger is a defect of the material mind.\n\nIt takes place when desires for happiness are obstructed and things do not turn out as expected.\n\nBy developing detachment and surrender to the will of God, one overcomes anger.\n\n### 13. Renunciation\n\nRenunciation is the understanding that the entire material energy belongs to God and it is meant for his pleasure.\n\nHence, the opulences of the world are not for one's enjoyment but for being utilized in the service of God.\n\nTo be fixed in this understanding is renunciation.\n\n### 14. Peacefulness\n\nPeacefulness is the ability to retain inner equilibrium despite disturbing external situations.\n\nIt requires mental poise and a sense of calmness that is not disturbed by the whims of others.\n\n### 15. Restraint from Fault-finding\n\nThe whole world and everything in it is a mixture of good and bad qualities.\n\nFocusing on defects in others dirties our mind, while focusing on their virtues purifies it.\n\nThe nature of a saintly person is to see his or her own defects and observe the virtues of others.\n\n### 16. Compassion toward All Living Beings\n\nAs individuals evolve spiritually, they naturally rise above self-centeredness and develop empathy for all living beings.\n\nCompassion is the deep sympathy that arises upon seeing the sufferings of others.\n\n### 17. Absence of Covetousness\n\nGreed is the desire to accumulate more than what one legitimately needs for the maintenance of the body.\n\nUnder its sway, people acquire huge amounts of wealth and possessions, though they know that at the time of death, everything will be left behind.\n\nFreedom from such covetousness leads to contentment and inner peace.\n\n### 18. Gentleness\n\nGentleness is a sign of spiritual refinement.\n\nThe disposition of behaving roughly with others arises from insensitivity to their feelings.\n\nBut as one grows in spiritual stature, one naturally sheds crudeness in behavior.\n\n### 19. Modesty\n\nModesty is the sense of guilt in performing actions contrary to the injunctions of scriptures and society.\n\nThe saintly nature is imbued with a ruthless inner conscience that gives one a sense of guilt in committing sinful acts.\n\n### 20. Lack of Fickleness\n\nWe may begin with good intentions, but if we get distracted by temptations and hardships, we cannot complete the journey.\n\nSuccess on the path of virtue comes by unwaveringly pursuing the goal despite all diversions that come on the way.\n\n### 21. Vigor\n\nFrom purity of mind comes a deep inner drive to act according to one's values and beliefs.\n\nHence, saintly personalities bring immense power and vigor to the tasks they pursue.\n\n### 22. Forgiveness or Forbearance\n\nForgiveness is the ability to tolerate the offenses of others, without feeling the need to retaliate.\n\nThrough forgiveness, one heals the emotional wounds caused by others that would otherwise fester and disturb the mind.\n\n### 23. Fortitude\n\nFortitude is the inner strength and determination in pursuing the goal, even when the mind and senses are wearied due to unfavorable circumstances.\n\nMost of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.\n\nSri Aurobindo put it eloquently, \"You have to be more persistent than the difficulty; there is no other way.\"\n\n### 24. Cleanliness\n\nCleanliness refers to both internal and external purity.\n\nVirtuous people believe in maintaining external cleanliness because it is conducive to internal purity.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw said, \"Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world.\"\n\n### 25. Bearing Enmity toward None\n\nBearing enmity toward others poisons our own mind, and this becomes an impediment in the path of spiritual progress.\n\nThe quality of freedom from hatred toward others is developed by realizing that they are also like us, and God resides in all.\n\n### 26. Absence of Vanity\n\nSelf-praise, boastfulness, ostentation, etc., all stem from pride.\n\nSaintly personalities see nothing in themselves to be proud about, but instead, feel gratitude to God for the good qualities they possess.\n\nThus, they refrain from self-aggrandizement."

    "explanation": "Shree Krishna's Explanation of the Six Traits of Demoniac Natured Individuals\n================================================================================\n\n### The External Appearance of Virtue\n\nShree Krishna now expounds upon the six traits of those who possess demoniac natures. They are hypocrites, meaning they make an external show of virtuous behavior for impressing others, without possessing the matching internal traits. This creates an artificial \"Jekyll and Hyde\" personality, which is impure internally but has the external appearance of being pure.\n\n### Characteristics of Demoniac Natured Individuals\n\nThe behavior of demoniac natured people is arrogant and disrespectful to others. They are proud and conceited about their bodily possessions and designations, such as wealth, education, beauty, position, etc.\n\n**Key Traits of Demoniac Natured Individuals**\n\n*   Arrogant and disrespect towards others\n*   Proud and conceited about bodily possessions and designations\n*   Angry when lust and greed are frustrated due to lack of control over the mind\n*   Cruel and harsh in interactions with others, devoid of sensitivity for their sufferings\n*   Lack understanding of spiritual principles and hold unrighteousness to be righteousness\n\n### Conclusion\n\nShree Krishna's explanation highlights the dangers of demoniac natured individuals and the importance of understanding their characteristics. By recognizing these traits, we can better navigate our interactions with others and cultivate a more virtuous lifestyle."

    "explanation": "### Understanding the Spiritual Path\n#### The Consequences of Demonic Qualities and Saintly Virtues\n\nHaving described the two kinds of natures, Shree Krishna now declares the consequences of both. He says that the demoniac qualities keep one fettered to the samsara of life and death, while the cultivation of saintly virtues helps one break through the bondage of Maya.\n\n### The Importance of a Sādhak's Watchfulness\nTo tread the spiritual path successfully and pursue it till the end, a sādhak (aspirant) needs to watch out for many things. If even one of the demoniac qualities, such as arrogance, hypocrisy, etc. remains in the personality, it can become the cause of failure.\n\n**Consequences of Unchecked Demonic Qualities**\n\n*   One can become trapped in the cycle of samsara and death\n*   Spiritual progress can be crippled without saintly qualities\n\n### The Need for Balancing Virtues\nSimultaneously, the divine virtues need to be developed. For without saintly qualities, our spiritual progress can again become crippled.\n\n**The Importance of Balance**\n\n*   Fortitude is necessary to overcome difficulties\n*   Forgiveness is required to free the mind from hatred and allow it to be absorbed in God\n*   Saintly virtues, as mentioned by Shree Krishna, increase the ability to progress rapidly and cope with obstacles on the path\n\n**Maintaining a Personal Diary: A Useful Technique**\nDeveloping good qualities and eliminating the bad ones is an integral part of spiritual practice. Many successful persons kept memoirs and diaries to help them develop the virtues they felt were necessary for success.\n\n**Examples from History**\n\n*   Mahatma Gandhi\n*   Benjamin Franklin\n\n### Overcoming the Challenge of Developing Devotion\nSome may argue that if we develop devotion to God, we will naturally, over time, acquire the saintly virtues described by Shree Krishna. That is indeed true, but it is unlikely that we will start out on the path full of devotion from the outset itself.\n\n**The Need for Self-Development**\n*   Developing devotion to God is crucial, but it requires slowly developing bhakti through practice\n*   Success in practice will come by possessing saintly qualities and eliminating demoniac ones\n\n**The Interplay Between Devotion and Self-Development**\nHence, as a part of our efforts in devotion, we must also keep working on ourselves to develop the divine qualities that Shree Krishna has mentioned in this chapter and shed any demoniac ones.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy understanding the consequences of demonic qualities and saintly virtues, a sādhak can develop the necessary balance to successfully tread the spiritual path. Maintaining a personal diary, as done by successful persons in history, can be a useful technique to develop virtues and overcome weaknesses."

    "explanation": "**The Natures of Living Beings**\n=====================================\n\n### Virtues and Defects in Past Lives\n---------------------------------------\n\nAll souls carry their natures with them from past lives. Accordingly, those cultivated virtuous qualities and performed meritorious deeds in the past lives are the ones who are born with divine natures, while those who indulged in sin and defiled their minds in previous lives carry the same tendencies into the present one. This explains the varieties of natures of living beings in the world.\n\nThe divine and demoniac natures are the two extremes of this spectrum. The living beings in the celestial abodes possess more virtuous qualities, while the demoniac traits dominate in the lower abodes. Humans possess a mixture of both divine and demoniac traits.\n\n### The Dilemma of Human Existence\n-----------------------------------\n\nEven in the cruelest butcher, we sometimes find the quality of kindness existing in personal life. And even in elevated spiritual aspirants we find defects of virtue. It is said that in \n**Satya-yug**, the gods and demons lived on different planets (i.e., separate planes of existence); in \n**Tretā-yug**, they resided on the same planet; during \n**Dwāpar-yug**, they lived in the same family; and in \n**Kali-yug**, the godly and demoniac natures coexist in the same person’s heart. That is the dilemma of human existence, where the higher self pulls it upward toward God, while the lower self pulls it downward.\n\n### The Two Aspects of Human Nature\n--------------------------------------\n\nHaving described the saintly qualities, Shree Krishna now goes into an extended description of the lower nature, to help us recognize it and avoid it. This is because it's easier to talk about the divine nature, but recognizing the lower nature is equally important for our spiritual growth.\n\n### Recognizing and Avoiding the Lower Nature\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe lower nature is multifaceted. It can manifest in various ways such as attachment, anger, greed and other vices. By recognizing these vices and practices self-control, we can overcome them.\n\nBy understanding our true nature, we can begin to walk the path of righteousness and ultimately attain liberation."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Dharma and Adharma**\n======================================\n\nDharma consists of codes of conduct that are conducive to one's purification and the general welfare of all living beings.\n\n**Adharma: Prohibited Actions**\n-----------------------------\n\nAdharma consists of prohibited actions that lead to degradation and cause harm to society. The demoniac nature is devoid of faith in the knowledge and wisdom of the scriptures. Hence, those under its sway are confused about what is right and wrong action.\n\n**Post-Modernism in Western Philosophy**\n---------------------------------------\n\nA typical example of this is the present trend in western philosophy. Having evolved through various schools of thought after the Renaissance, such as Age of Enlightenment, Humanism, Empiricism, Communism, Existentialism, and Skepticism, the present era in western philosophy is labeled as “Post-modernism.” The prevalent view of Post-modernist thought is that there is no absolute truth. Multitudes have rejected the possibility that such a thing as absolute truth could exist.\n\n**The Absurdity of Relativism**\n---------------------------\n\n“All is relative” has become the slogan of the post-modernist era of philosophy. We often hear phrases like “that may be true for you, but it’s not true for me.” Truth is seen as a personal preference or perception that cannot extend beyond a person’s individual boundaries. This viewpoint has a big bearing on the subject of ethics, which deals with the question of right and wrong behavior.\n\n**Consequences of Relativism**\n---------------------------\n\nIf there is no such thing as absolute truth, then there is no ultimate moral rightness or wrongness about anything. Then, people are justified in saying, “It may be right for you but that does not mean it is right for me.” Such an idea is very appealing to many, but if taken to its logical extreme it proves absurd and disastrous.\n\n**Examples of Absurdity**\n-----------------------\n\nWhat if it is right for someone to ignore traffic lights, even when they are red? That person will put the life of others at risk by doing what he believes is right. What if it is considered right by someone to go on a suicide-bombing mission in a heavily populated civilian area amongst people he sees as enemies? He may be fully convinced that what he is doing is correct.\n\n**The Ruin of Ethics**\n-------------------\n\nIf there is no such thing as absolute truth, then no-one can really say “he should do that” or “she shouldn’t do that.” All one can say is, “A lot of people do not feel good about this action.” According to the relativist viewpoint, one might respond, “That may be true for you, but it is certainly not true for us.” These can be the ruinous ethical consequences of disregarding the belief of an Absolute Truth.\n\n**A Warning from Shree Krishna**\n------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna states that the demoniac nature is confused about what is right and what is wrong, and thus, neither purity, nor truth, nor right conduct is found in them.\n\n**The Predominant Views of Post-Modernists**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIn the following verse, he goes on to describe the predominant views of such people."

    "explanation": "### Refraining from Immoral Behavior\n\n#### Two Ways to Avoid Unrighteousness\nThere are two ways of refraining from immoral behavior. The first is to refrain from unrighteousness through the exercise of will-power. The second way is to abstain from sin due to fear of God.\n\n#### Fear-Based Abstinence\nPeople who have the ability to abstain from sinning merely by will-power are very few. The majority of people desist from doing wrong due to the fear of punishment.\n\n#### Human Nature and Speed Limit\nFor example, it is observed on highways that the moment a police car is spotted, people immediately slow down to the permissible speed limit. However, when they perceive there is no danger of being caught, they do not hesitate in exceeding the speed limit. This illustrates a fundamental aspect of human nature: we tend to follow rules when we're afraid of consequences, but not when we feel safe.\n\n#### Belief in God and Moral Behavior\nThus, if we believe in God, out of fear of him we will refrain from immoral behavior. Instead, if we do not believe in God, all his laws will still be applicable to us, and we will suffer the consequences of wrong-behavior.\n\n### The Devil's Perspective\n\n#### Rejection of Authority and Regulation\nThose with demoniac natures do not wish to accept this imposition of authority and regulation of behavior that is a necessary corollary of belief in God. Instead, they prefer to subscribe to the view that there is no God and the world has no basis for moral order.\n\n#### The Big Bang Theory as a Cover-Up\nThey propagate ideas such as the “Big Bang Theory,” which postulates that the world was created by an accidental explosion that took place at time zero of creation, and thus there is no God who sustains the world. Such theories permit them to engage in sensual gratification without scruples or fear of consequences.\n\n### The Nature of Lust\n\n#### Sensual Gratification and the Distorted Reflection\nAmongst the various forms of sensual gratification, sexual indulgence is the most intense. This is because the material realm is like a distorted reflection of the spiritual realm. In the spiritual realm, divine love is the basis of the activities of the liberated souls and their interactions with God. In the material realm, its distorted reflection, lust, dominates the consciousness of materially conditioned souls, particularly those under the mode of passion.\n\n#### The Purpose of Human Life\nThus, the demoniac-minded see engagement in lustful activities as the purpose of human life. This misguided perspective stems from their inability to accept the authority and regulation that comes with believing in a higher power."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of the Demoniac Mind**\n\n### The Fabrication of Distorted Views\n\nBereft of true self-knowledge, the demoniac-minded fabricate distorted views of the truth with their impure intellects. An example of this is the theory of Charvak, a well-known materialistic philosopher in Indian history. He said:\n\n#### yāvajjīveta sukaṁ jīvet, ṛiṇaṁ kṛitvā ghṛitaṁ pivet\n\n#### bhasmī bhūtasya dehasya punarāgamanaṁ kutaḥ [v2]\n\n*“As long as you live, enjoy yourself. If drinking ghee gives you pleasure, then do so even if you have to take a debt for the purpose. When the body is cremated, you will cease to exist, and will not come back in the world again (so do not worry of any karmic consequences of your actions).”*\n\n### The Rejection of Eternity and Karmic Consequences\n\nThis quote illustrates the demoniac-minded rejection of eternity and karmic consequences. They believe that as long as they live, they should enjoy themselves without worrying about future repercussions. This mindset allows them to engage in self-serving and cruel deeds without hesitation.\n\n### The Imposition of Materialistic Views\n\nThe demoniac-minded impose their misleading materialistic views on others, even if they possess power over humans. This results in the pursuit of self-centered goals without regard for the suffering and destruction it causes to others.\n\n### Historical Examples\n\nIn history, humankind has repeatedly witnessed megalomaniac dictators and emperors, such as Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, etc. who were motivated by their perverse views of the truth and brought about untold suffering and devastation to the world.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe demoniac-minded philosophy, exemplified by Charvak's theory and illustrated by historical figures, is a recipe for destruction. It rejects the fundamental principles of eternity, karmic consequences, and spiritual growth. By understanding this philosophy, we can better appreciate the importance of self-knowledge, moral responsibility, and a more profound understanding of the world we live in."

They prefer to pursue the way of the world that promises to provide immediate gratification, but they end up struggling even more in the worldly direction. Their desires for material attainments torment them and they undertake enormous schemes to fulfill their aspirations.\n\n**The Nature of Desires**\n\nWhen a cherished object is attained, for a moment they experience relief, but then new anguish begins. They are worried about the object being snatched away and they labor to retain it. Finally, when the inevitable separation from the object of attachment takes place, there is only misery.\n\n**A Charming Analogy**\n\nThis cycle can be likened to a beautiful garden, where one cultivates flowers and trees, only to find that it is slowly destroyed by the very actions they took to nurture it. Or consider the story of a person who plants a seed, only to find that it grows into a tree, only to be cut down by the wind. This is the nature of attachment and desire.\n\n**A Warning from the Divine**\n\n“People experience untold worries and stress in worldly endeavors—bringing up children and grandchildren, engaging in business, accumulating wealth and treasures, and acquiring fame. If they show the same level of attachment and concern for developing love for Shree Krishna’s lotus feet, they will never again have to worry about Yamraj, the god of death (for they will cross over the cycle of life and death).\"\n\n**The Refusal to Accept Reality**\n\nBut the demoniac-minded refuse to accept this blatant fact because their intellects are convinced that worldly pleasures are the highest experience of joy. They cannot even see that death is patiently waiting to carry them off to miserable destinies and more suffering in future lives."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Modesty in Wealth Accumulation**\n\nMoney is the means for enjoying the world. That is why materialistic people who are driven by insatiable desires accord such priority to accumulating it in their lives. They do not even hesitate to adopt unlawful means for earning wealth. Therefore, double punishment awaits them for their unethical conduct.\n\n### The Teachings of the Bhagavatam\n\nThe Bhāgavatam states:\n\n#### yāvad bhriyeta jaṭharaṁ tāvat svatvaṁ hi dehinām\n\n#### adhikaṁ yo ’bhimanyeta sa steno daṇḍam arhati \n(7.14.8)[v4]\n\n**The Right Approach to Wealth Accumulation**\n\n“One is entitled to keep only as much wealth as is necessary for one’s maintenance (the rest must be given away in charity). If one accumulates more than one’s need, one is a thief in the eyes of God, and will be punished for it.” What is the punishment?\n\n**Punishment at Death**\n\nFirstly, at the time of death, the wealth one earned will not go along—it will be snatched away.\n\n**Karmic Punishment**\n\nSecondly, according to the law of karma, one will be punished for the sins committed in earning the wealth. Just as, if a smuggler is caught, not only are his goods confiscated, but he is also punished for breaking the law.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the Bhagavatam emphasizes the importance of modesty in wealth accumulation. It teaches us to keep only what is necessary for our maintenance and give the rest away in charity. By following this approach, we can avoid the double punishment that awaits those who accumulate wealth unethically."

    "explanation": "**The Ego's Grip: Complaining, Resentment, and the Illusion of Control**\n\nUnder the sway of the ego, people identify with their mind and become confined by its dysfunctional and repetitive thought patterns. They become practically possessed by their own mind, which goes on and on like a broken record, and they live in the reality their thoughts create for them.\n\n### A Favorite Thought Pattern of the Impure Mind\n\nOne such favorite thought pattern of the impure mind is complaining. It loves to whine and feel resentful not only about people but also about situations. The implication is, “This should not be happening,” “I do not want to be here,” “I am being treated unfairly,” etc. Every complaint is a little story that the mind makes up and the individual completely believes in it.\n\n### The Voice in the Head\n\nThe voice in the head tells sad, anxious, or angry stories about one's life. And the poor individual, under the sway of the ego, accepts what the voice says. When complaining aggravates, it turns into resentment.\n\n### The Evolution of Resentment\n\nResentment means feeling bitter, indignant, aggrieved, or offended. When the resentment becomes longstanding, it is called a grievance. A grievance is a strong negative emotion connected to an event in the past that is being kept alive by compulsive thinking, by retelling the story in the head of “what someone did to me.”\n\n### The Consequences of a Life of Complaining and Resentment\n\nConsequently, those who live in the mesh of delusion created by the ego become bewildered by numerous thoughts of the poorest quality. They obscure their own destiny.\n\n### Karma and Its Consequences\n\nHumans are free to perform karmas by their choice, but they are not free to determine the results of their actions. The results are bestowed by God in accordance with the law of karma.\n\n### Understanding Karma\n\nThe Ramayan states:\n\n#### karama pradhāna bisva kari rākhā, jo jasa karai so tasa phala chākhā \n[v9]\n\n“Actions are important in this world. Whatever actions people perform, they taste the corresponding fruits.” Hence, everyone has to face the karmic consequences of their actions.\n\n### The Principle of Karma\n\nThe Bible also states: “Be sure your sin will find you out.” (Numbers 32.23)[v9.1] Thus, in their next lives, God casts those who choose to cultivate demoniac qualities into inferior states of existence. The principle is very simple:\n\n#### ūrdhvaṁ gachchhanti sattvasthā madhye tiṣhṭhanti rājasāḥ\n#### jaghanya guṇa vṛittisthā adho tiṣhṭhanti tāmasāḥ \n(Garuḍ Purāṇ)[v10]\n\n“Those who act out of \nsāttvic\n mentalities rise to the higher levels of existence; those who act out of \nrājasic\n mentalities remain in the middle regions; and those who act out of a \ntāmasic\n mentality and are inclined toward sin descend to the lower levels of existence.”\n\n### The Illusion of Control\n\nConsequently, those who live in the mesh of delusion created by the ego become bewildered by numerous thoughts of the poorest quality. They obscure their own destiny.\n\n#### Why Do We Complain and Resent?\n\nWe complain and resent for various reasons, but ultimately, it's because we're trying to control our lives. We feel like we can't change ourselves or our external circumstances, so we try to control the world around us.\n\n### The Realities of Karma\n\nThe results of our actions are not under our control. We can't choose the outcome, but we can choose how we react to it.\n\n#### The Ramayan's Teachings\n\nThe Ramayan teaches us that our actions have consequences. Whatever we do, will eventually come back to us.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe must understand that our thoughts create our reality. We can't control the world, but we can control how we react to it.\n\n#### The Key to Happiness\n\nThe key to happiness is not in avoiding the bad things that happen to us, but in learning from them and moving forward.\n\n#### Letting Go of Negative Thoughts\n\nWe must learn to let go of our negative thoughts and emotions. We can't control them, but we can choose how we react to them.\n\n#### The Power of Karma\n\nOur karma is a reflection of our character. It determines where we'll be reborn in the next life.\n\n#### The Importance of Sattvic Actions\n\nWe must strive to act sattvic. This means being mindful, compassionate, and non-judgmental.\n\n#### The Consequences of Rājacic Actions\n\nWe must avoid acting rājacic. This means being impulsive, impatient, and insensitive.\n\n#### The Dangers of Tāmasic Actions\n\nWe must avoid acting tāmasic. This means being selfish, cruel, and destructive.\n\n#### The Power of God\n\nGod is the one who determines our karma. He sees everything we do and reap the consequences of our actions.\n\n#### The Cycle of Birth and Death\n\nOur karma determines where we'll be reborn in the next life.

This means achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\n#### The Teachings of Shree Krishna\n\nShree Krishna teaches us that our karma is a reflection of our character. We must strive to act sattvic and avoid acting rājacic or tāmasic.\n\n#### The Importance of Self-Knowledge\n\nWe must strive to gain self-knowledge. This means understanding our true nature and the true nature of the world around us.\n\n#### The Role of the Ego\n\nThe ego plays a significant role in our lives. We must strive to keep it in check and avoid letting it control us.\n\n#### The Power of Mind\n\nOur mind is a powerful tool. We must strive to use it wisely and avoid letting it control us.\n\n#### The Importance of Compassion\n\nCompassion is an essential quality. We must strive to cultivate it and use it to help others.\n\n#### The Dangers of Hatred\n\nHatred is a destructive quality. We must strive to avoid it and cultivate compassion instead.\n\n#### The Power of Love\n\nLove is a powerful force. We must strive to cultivate it and use it to help others.\n\n#### The Importance of Mindfulness\n\nMindfulness is an essential quality. We must strive to cultivate it and be present in the moment.\n\n#### The Role of Karma\n\nKarma is a fundamental principle. We must strive to understand it and use it to our advantage.\n\n#### The Teachings of the Bible\n\nThe Bible teaches us that our actions have consequences. We must strive to act with integrity and avoid harming others.\n\n#### The Importance of Forgiveness\n\nForgiveness is an essential quality. We must strive to cultivate it and let go of our negative emotions.\n\n#### The Power of Gratitude\n\nGratitude is a powerful force. We must strive to cultivate it and express our appreciation for the good things in our lives.\n\n#### The Role of Karma in Our Lives\n\nKarma plays a significant role in our lives. We must strive to understand it and use it to our advantage.\n\n#### The Teachings of the Ramayan\n\nThe Ramayan teaches us that our actions have consequences.

We must strive to act sattvic and avoid acting rājacic or tāmasic.\n\n#### The Goal of Life\n\nOur goal is to attain moksha. This means achieving liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nWe must strive to understand the principles of karma and living a sattvic life. We must avoid acting rājacic or tāmasic, and cultivate compassion, gratitude, and forgiveness instead."

They engage in prohibited acts and refrain from recommended ones.\n\n**The Consequences of Such Behavior**\n--------------------------------------\n\nReferring to such people, Shree Krishna declares that those who renounce the authorized path and act according to their whims, impelled by the impulses of their desires, achieve neither true knowledge, nor the perfection of happiness, nor liberation from material bondage."

    "explanation": "**The Importance of Following the Teachings of the Scriptures**\n\nShree Krishna now gives the final conclusion of the teachings in this chapter. By comparing and differentiating between the divine and demoniac natures, he highlighted how the demoniac nature leads to hellish existence. Thus, he established that nothing is to be gained by discarding the injunctions of the scriptures. Now he drives home the point by stating that the absolute authority in ascertaining the propriety of any activity, or lack of it, are the Vedic scriptures.\n\n**The Dangers of Following One's Heart Alone**\n\nSometimes, even well-intentioned people say, “I do not care for rules. I follow my heart and do my own thing.” It is all very well to follow the heart, but how can they be sure that their heart is not misleading them? As the saying goes, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Thus, it is always wise to check with the scriptures whether our heart is truly guiding us in the proper direction.\n\n**Establishing Authenticity Through the Vedas**\n\nThe Manu Smṛiti states:\n\n### bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhaviṣhyaṁ cha sarvaṁ vedāt prasidhyati\n (12.97)[v12]\n\n“The authenticity of any spiritual principle of the past, present, or future, must be established on the basis of the Vedas.” Hence, Shree Krishna concludes by instructing Arjun to comprehend the teachings of the scriptures and act according to them.\n\n**The Significance of Following the Teachings of the Scriptures**\n\nBy following the teachings of the scriptures, we can ensure that our actions are guided by divine authority and wisdom. The Vedas serve as a guiding light, helping us to distinguish between right and wrong, and making wise decisions that lead us towards spiritual growth and enlightenment. In the words of Shree Krishna, it is essential to comprehend and act according to the teachings of the scriptures."

    "explanation": "**Understanding Faith Based on Scriptural Guidance**\n=====================================================\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn the preceding chapter, Shree Krishna spoke of the differences between the divine and demoniac natures, to help Arjun understand the virtues that should be cultivated and personality traits that should be eradicated. At the end of the chapter, he stated that one who disregards the injunctions of the scriptures, and instead foolishly follows the impulses of the body and the whims of the mind, will not achieve perfection, happiness, or freedom from the cycle of life and death.\n\n### Key Points\n\n*   Shree Krishna advised that people follow the guidance of the scriptures and act accordingly.\n*   The instruction led to Arjun's present question regarding faith without reference to the Vedic scriptures.\n*   Arjun wishes to understand the answer in terms of the three modes of material nature.\n\n### Understanding Faith Based on Scriptural Guidance\n\nShree Krishna recommended that people follow the guidance of the scriptures and act accordingly. This instruction led to Arjun's present question regarding faith without reference to the Vedic scriptures.\n\n### The Three Modes of Material Nature\n\nTo answer Arjun's question, we need to understand the three modes of material nature:\n\n*   **Rajo-guna** (ignorant, foolish): the mode of ignorance and foolishness, characterized by attachment to sense pleasures and a lack of spiritual awareness.\n*   **Majo-guna** (intelligent, proud): the mode of intelligence and pride, characterized by a sense of self-importance and a lack of humility.\n*   **Sato-guna** (pure, equanimous): the mode of purity and equanimity, characterized by a sense of detachment and inner peace.\n\n### Understanding Faith in the Context of Scriptural Guidance\n\nShree Krishna's advice to follow the guidance of the scriptures and act accordingly is essential in understanding faith. Faith without reference to the Vedic scriptures would likely be based on the three modes of material nature, which are:\n\n*   **Rajo-guna**: faith based on ignorance and foolishness.\n*   **Majo-guna**: faith based on intelligence and pride.\n*   **Sato-guna**: faith based on purity and equanimity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nShree Krishna's instruction to follow the guidance of the scriptures and act accordingly is crucial in understanding faith. By following this path, one can achieve perfection, happiness, and freedom from the cycle of life and death."

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Faith**\n=======================\n\nNobody can be without faith, for it is an inseparable aspect of the human personality. Those who do not believe in the scriptures are also not bereft of faith. Their faith is reposed elsewhere. It could be on the logical ability of their intellect, or the perceptions of their senses, or the theories they have decided to believe in.\n\n**Types of Faith**\n------------------\n\nFor example, when people say, “I do not believe in God because I cannot see him,” they do not have faith in God but they have faith in their eyes. Hence, they assume that if their eyes cannot see something, it probably does not exist. This is also a kind of faith.\n\nOthers say, “I do not believe in the authenticity of the ancient scriptures. Instead I accept the theories of modern science.” This is also a kind of faith, for we have seen in the last few centuries how theories of science keep getting amended and overthrown. It is possible that the present scientific theories we believe to be true may also be proved incorrect in the future. Accepting them as truths is also a leap of faith.\n\n**The Leaping Point**\n--------------------\n\nProf. Charles H. Townes, Nobel Prize winner in Physics, expressed this very nicely:\n\n> \"Science itself requires faith. We don't know if our logic is correct. I don't know if you are there. You don't know if I am here. We may just be imagining all this. I have a faith that the world is what it seems like, and thus I believe you are there. I can't prove it from any fundamental point of view... Yet I have to accept a certain framework in which to operate.\"\n\n**The Misconception**\n---------------------\n\nThe idea that \"religion is faith\" and \"science is knowledge,\" I think, is quite wrong. We scientists believe in the existence of the external world and the validity of our own logic. We feel quite comfortable about it. Nevertheless, these are acts of faith.\n\n**The Universality of Faith**\n---------------------------\n\nWhether one is a material scientist, a social scientist, or a spiritual scientist, one cannot avoid the leap of faith required in the acceptance of knowledge.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Response**\n---------------------------\n\n[Shree Krishna] : Ah, the reason why different people choose to place their faith in different places. It is because of our individual experiences, perceptions, and understanding of the world.\n\n[Shree Krishna] : We see things that we believe in, and our minds create the illusion of reality. This is why some people place their faith in God, while others believe in science and its theories.\n\n[Shree Krishna] : The truth is that faith is a natural part of our existence. It is how we perceive the world, and it is what drives us to believe in something greater than ourselves.\n\n[Shree Krishna] : So, whether you are a material scientist or a spiritual scientist, remember that faith is always present. It may manifest in different forms and ways, but it is an inseparable aspect of our human nature."

Where we decide to place our faith and what we choose to believe in practically shapes the direction of our life. Those who develop the conviction that money is of paramount importance in the world spend their entire life accumulating it. Those who believe that fame counts more than anything else dedicate their time and energy in chasing political posts and social designations. Those who believe in noble values sacrifice everything to uphold them.\n\n### Examples of Faith\n\n*   **Materialism**: Developing a conviction that money is the most important aspect of life leads to an entire life spent accumulating wealth.\n*   **Fame and Power**: Believing that fame counts more than anything else results in dedicating time and energy towards pursuing political posts and social designations.\n*   **Noble Values**: Believing in noble values leads to making sacrifices for those values.\n\n**Mahatma Gandhi's Faith**\n\nMahatma Gandhi had faith in the incomparable importance of satya (truth) and ahinsā (non-violence), and by the strength of his convictions he launched a non-violent movement that succeeded in evicting from India the most powerful empire in the world.\n\n### The Role of Faith in Our Life\n\nShree Krishna states that the quality of our faith decides the direction of our life. In turn, the quality of our faith is decided by the nature of our mind.\n\n**The Nature of Our Mind**\n\nIn response to Arjun's question, Shree Krishna begins expounding on the kinds of faith that exist."

Each guṇa attracts individuals with similar energies and tendencies.\n\n#### Sattva Guṇa\nThose imbued with sattva guṇa are drawn to the worship of celestial gods, perceiving in them the qualities of goodness. They find solace and peace in the company of divine beings.\n\n#### Rājasic Guṇa\nOn the other hand, individuals with rājasic guṇa are attracted to the semi-celestial beings known as yakṣhas, who exude power and wealth. They are also drawn to rākṣhasas, powerful beings that embody sensual enjoyment, revenge, and wrath.\n\n**A Misguided Attraction**\n-------------------------\n\nThose in tamo guṇa are surprisingly drawn to ghosts and spirits, despite the evil and cruel nature of these beings. They even offer the blood of animals to appease these lower entities, with faith in the propriety of such lowly worship.\n\n**The Ultimate Truth**\n----------------------\n\nHowever, true worship is perfectly directed when it is offered to the one and only God. All other forms of worship, although seemingly pleasing to the lower beings, ultimately lead astray from the ultimate truth."

    "explanation": "**Interconnectedness of Mind and Body**\n======================================\n\nThe mind and body have a profound impact on each other. One of the most significant aspects of this interconnectedness is the influence that food has on our nature and vice versa. This concept is well-explained in the Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad.\n\n**The Cycle of Food and Transformation**\n----------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad, the food we eat undergoes a transformation process in our body. The coarser parts of the food are eliminated as feces, while the subtler parts become flesh. The most subtle part of the food, however, becomes the mind.\n\n**The Relationship Between Food and Mind**\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad also highlights the reciprocal relationship between food and mind. It states:\n\n`āhāra śhuddhu sattva śhuddhiḥ`\n(\"By eating pure food, the mind becomes pure.\")\n\nThis verse emphasizes that not only does pure food nourish our body, but it also purifies our mind. Conversely, a pure mind is attracted to pure foods.\n\n**The Cycle of Purification**\n---------------------------\n\nIn essence, the Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad explains that there is a cyclical process of purification between food and mind. When we eat pure foods, our body and mind become purified. On the other hand, when we consume impure or unhealthy foods, our body and mind are affected negatively.\n\nThis understanding of the interconnectedness between food and mind is a valuable lesson in maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle."

Foods in the mode of goodness have the same effect.\n\n**Characteristics of Foods in the Mode of Goodness**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThese foods are described with the words \"āyuḥ sattva\", meaning “which promote longevity.” They bestow good health, virtue, happiness, and satisfaction. Such foods are juicy, naturally tasteful, mild, and beneficial.\n\n**Types of Foods in the Mode of Goodness**\n--------------------------------------\n\n* Grains\n* Pulses\n* Beans\n* Fruits\n* Vegetables\n* Milk\n* Other vegetarian foods\n\n**Benefits of a Vegetarian Diet**\n-----------------------------------\n\nA vegetarian diet is beneficial for cultivating the qualities of the mode of goodness that are conducive for spiritual life.\n\n**Quotes from Noted Thinkers and Philosophers**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNumerous thinkers and philosophers in history have echoed this sentiment:\n\n### Vegetarianism as a Greater Progress\n\n“Vegetarianism is a greater progress. From the greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension motivated him to become a vegetarian. Flesh-eating is an unprovoked murder.” - Benjamin Franklin\n\n### The Need to Correct a Misconception\n\n“Is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in a great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a miserable way. I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized.” - Henry David Thoreau, \"Walden\"\n\n### Correcting a Misconception about Vegetarianism\n\n“ It is necessary to correct the error that vegetarianism has made us weak in mind, or passive or inert in action. I do not regard flesh-food as necessary at any stage.” - Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n### The Importance of Living in Harmony with Nature\n\n“ O my fellow men, do not defile your bodies with sinful foods. We have corn and we have apples bending down the branches with their weight. There are vegetables that can be cooked and softened over the fire. The earth affords a lavish supply of riches, of innocent foods, and offers you banquets that involve no bloodshed or slaughter; only beasts satisfy their hunger with flesh, and not even all of those, because horses, cattle, and sheep live on grass.” - Pythagoras\n\n### A Call to Action Against Senseless Violence\n\n“I do not want to make my stomach a graveyard of dead animals.” - George Bernard Shaw.\n\n### The Heinous Act of Killing Cows\n-----------------------------------\n\nEven amongst violence against animals, killing of the cow is particularly heinous. The cow provides milk for human consumption, and so it is like a mother to human beings. To kill the mother cow when it is no longer capable of giving milk is an insensitive, uncultured, and ungrateful act."

While describing them, the word “very” can be added to all the adjectives used. Thus, rājasic foods are very bitter, very sour, very salty, very hot, very pungent, very dry, full of chillies, etc.\n\n**The Unhealthy Effects**\n-------------------------\n\nThese rājasic foods produce ill-health, agitation, and despair. On the other hand, persons in the mode of passion find such foods attractive, but those in the mode of goodness find them disgusting.\n\n**The Purpose of Eating**\n-------------------------\n\nThe purpose of eating is not to relish bliss through the palate, but to keep the body healthy and strong. As the old adage states:\n\n**\"Eat to Live; Do Not Live to Eat.\"**\n\nThis wise saying emphasizes the importance of consuming foods that are conducive to good health, and have a peaceful impact on the mind. This refers to sāttvic foods.\n\n**Characteristics of Sāttvic Foods**\n------------------------------------\n\nSāttvic foods are the opposite of rājasic foods. They are:\n\n*   Very sweet\n*   Very mild\n*   Very nourishing\n*   Free from excessive chilies and spices\n*   Easy to digest\n\nBy choosing sāttvic foods, individuals can maintain a healthy body and mind."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Ignorance and Impurity**\n=====================================================\n\n### Classification of Foods\n\n17.10 Cooked foods that have remained for more than one yām (three hours) are classified in the mode of ignorance. Foods that are impure, have bad taste, or possess foul smells come in the same category. Impure foods also include all kinds of meat products.\n\n**Understanding the Reasons Behind This Classification**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNature has designed the human body to be vegetarian. Human beings do not have long canine teeth as carnivorous animals do, or a wide jaw suitable for tearing flesh. Carnivores have short bowels to allow minimal transit time for the unstable and dead animal food, which putrefies and decays faster.\n\nOn the contrary, humans have a longer digestive tract for the slow and better absorption of plant food. The stomach of carnivores is more acidic than human beings, which enables them to digest raw meat.\n\n**Physical Characteristics of Human Beings**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nInterestingly, the carnivorous animals do not sweat through their pores. Rather, they regulate body temperature through their tongue.\n\nOn the other hand, herbivorous animals and humans control bodily temperature by sweating through their skin. While drinking, carnivores lap up water rather than suck it.\n\nIn contrast, herbivores do not lap up water; they suck it. Humans too suck water while drinking; they do not lap it up.\n\n### Implications of Meat-Eating\n------------------------------\n\nAll these physical characteristics of the human body reveal that God has not created us as carnivorous creatures, and consequently, meat is considered impure food for humans.\n\n**The Concept of Karma**\n------------------------\n\nMeat-eating also creates bad karma. The Manu Smṛiti states:\n\n> \"māṁ sa bhakṣhayitā 'utra yasya māṁsam ihādmy aham\n> etan māṁsasya māṅsatvaṁ pravadanti manīṣhiṇaḥ \n> (5.55)[v2]\"\n>\n> \"The word mānsa (meat) means 'that whom I am eating here will eat me in my next life.' For this reason, the learned say that meat is called mānsa (a repeated act: I eat him, he eats me).\"\n\nThis quote emphasizes the idea that eating meat is a repeated act that affects our karma in future lives."

It emphasizes the importance of detachment and renunciation.\n*   **Vidhi driṣhṭaḥ**: This phrase, which translates to \"according to the injunctions of the Vedic scriptures,\" highlights the significance of following established guidelines and principles. It ensures that the sacrifice is performed with precision and accuracy.\n*   **Yaṣhṭavyam evaiti**: This phrase, which means \"only for the sake of worship of the Lord,\" as required by the scriptures, underscores the primary objective of a sacrifice performed in the mode of goodness. The focus is solely on pleasing and serving the divine.\n\n### Classification of a Sacrifice in Goodness\n\nWhen **yajña** is performed in this manner, it is classified as a sacrifice in the mode of goodness.

However, who is to decide what is beneficial and what is harmful? And in case a dispute arises, what is the basis for resolving it?\n\n**The Role of Scriptures as Guide Maps**\n\nIf everyone makes their own decisions then pandemonium will prevail. So the injunctions of the scriptures serve as guide maps and wherever a doubt arises, we consult these scriptures for ascertaining the propriety of any action. However, those in the mode of ignorance do not have faith in the scriptures. They carry out religious ceremonies but disregard the ordinances of the scriptures.\n\n**The Commercialization of Festivals in India**\n\nIn India, specific gods and goddess associated with each festival are worshipped with great pomp and splendor. Often the motive behind the external grandeur of the ceremony—gaudy decorations, dazzling illumination, and blaring music—is to collect contributions from the neighborhood.\n\n**The Failure to Follow Vedic Injunctions**\n\nFurther, the Vedic injunction of offering a donation to the priests performing religious ceremony, as a mark of gratitude and respect, is not followed. Sacrifice in which such injunctions of the scriptures are ignored and a self-determined process is followed, due to laziness, indifference, or belligerence, is in the mode of ignorance.\n\n**The Consequences of Ignoring the Scriptures**\n\nSuch faith is actually a form of faithlessness in God and the scriptures.

    "explanation": "**The Austerity of the Mind**\n================================\n\nA key aspect of self-improvement is mastering the mind. This involves cultivating positive thoughts, emotions, and actions that lead to a higher level of consciousness.\n\n### The Mind: A Garden\n\nThe mind can be likened to a garden. Just as a gardener cultivates their plot, growing fruits, flowers, and vegetables, we must cultivate our own mind with rich and noble thoughts. At the same time, we must ensure that it remains free from weeds such as resentment, hatred, blame, unforgivingness, criticism, and condemnation.\n\n#### Weeding Out Negative Thoughts\n\nIf we allow these negative thoughts to reside in our mind, they will have a debilitating effect on our personality. We can never get a fair amount of constructive action out of the mind until we have learned to control it and keep it from becoming stimulated by anger, hatred, dislike, etc.\n\n#### The Power of Our Thoughts\n\nPeople often imagine that their thoughts are secret and have no external consequences because they dwell within the mind, away from the sight of others. However, this is not the case.\n\n#### Thoughts Shape Our Personality\n\nOur thoughts forge our inner character and external personality. This is why we look upon someone and say, \"He seems like a very simple and trustworthy person.\" For another person, we say, \"She seems to be very cunning and deceitful. Stay away from her.\"\n\n#### The Glances of Our Eyes\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson said, \"There is full confession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations, in the grasp of the hands. Our sin bedaubs us, mars all the good impressions. Men do not know why they do not trust us. The vice glasses the eyes, demeans the cheek, pinches the nose, and writes, 'O fool, fool!' on the forehead of a king.\"\n\n#### The Connection Between Thoughts and Character\n\nAnother powerful saying linking thoughts to character states is:\n\n\"Watch your thoughts, for they become words.\nWatch your words, for they become actions.\nWatch your actions, for they become habits.\nWatch your habits, for they become character.\nWatch your character, for it becomes your destiny.\"\n\n### The Power of Positive Thoughts\n\nIt is essential to realize that we harm ourselves with every negative thought that we harbor in our mind. At the same time, we uplift ourselves with every positive thought that we dwell upon.\n\n#### Thoughts are Things\n\nHenry Van Dyke expressed this very vividly in his poem \"Thoughts are things.\" He wrote:\n\n\"I hold it true that thoughts are things;\nThey're endowed with bodies and breath and wings\nThat which we call our secret thought\nSpeeds forth to earth's remotest spot,\nLeaving its blessings or its woes,\nLike tracks behind as it goes.\n\nWe build our future, thought by thought.\nFor good or ill, yet know it not,\nChoose, then, thy destiny and wait,\nFor love brings love, and hate brings hate.\n\nEach thought we dwell upon has consequences, and thought-by-thought, we forge our destiny.\"\n\n### The Austerity of the Mind\n\nTo veer the mind from negative emotions and make it dwell upon the positive sentiments is considered austerity of the mind. This involves cultivating a higher level of consciousness and making conscious choices about our thoughts, emotions, and actions. By doing so, we can create a more positive and uplifting life."

    "explanation": "**Characteristics of Austerities Performed in the Mode of Goodness**\n===========================================================\n\n### Overview of Austerities in the Mode of Goodness\n\nHaving delineated the austerities of the body, speech, and mind, Shree Krishna now mentions their characteristics when they are performed in the mode of goodness. He says that an austerity loses its sanctity when material benefits are sought from its performance.\n\n### Essential Qualities of Austerities in the Mode of Goodness\n\nAn austerity must be performed in a selfless manner, without attachment to rewards. This ensures that the true purpose and value of the austerity are not compromised.\n\n**Key Requirements for Austerities Performed in the Mode of Goodness**\n\n*   **Selflessness**: The austerity should be performed without attachment to rewards or personal benefits.\n*   **Strength of Faith**: Our faith in the value of the austerity should remain steadfast, even in the face of success or failure.\n\n### Guidelines for Practicing Austerities\n\nThe practice of austerities should also be guided by the following principles:\n\n*   **Perseverance**: The practice of austerities should not be suspended due to laziness or inconvenience.\n*   **Steadfastness**: Our faith in the value of the austerity should remain steadfast, regardless of external circumstances.\n\n**Consequences of Seeking Material Benefits from Austerities**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn austerity loses its sanctity when material benefits are sought from its performance. This can lead to a distortion of the true purpose and value of the austerity, ultimately undermining its effectiveness."

    "explanation": "**The True Nature of Austerity**\n=====================================\n\n### A Powerful Tool for Self-Purification\n\nAlthough austerity is a powerful tool for the purification of the self, not everyone utilizes it with pure intention. A politician labors rigorously to give many lectures a day, which is also a form of austerity, but the purpose is to gain a post and prestige. Similarly, if one engages in spiritual activities to achieve honor and adulation, then the motive is equally material though the means is different.\n\n### Classification of Austerity\n\nAn austerity is classified in the mode of passion if it is performed for the sake of gaining respect, power, or other material rewards.\n\n**Key Distinctions**\n--------------------\n\n*   **Pure Intention vs. Material Motive**: Austerity is used for self-purification when done with pure intention, but it can be exploited for material gain.\n*   **Means are Different, Motive is the Same**: Spiritual activities done with a material motive differ from those done with pure intention.\n*   **Classification**: Austerity that aims for respect, power, or material rewards falls into the category of passion.\n\n**The Dangers of Austerity Misused**\n------------------------------------\n\nWhen austerity is pursued with a material motive, it can lead to an imbalance in one's life. Such actions can ultimately undermine the very purpose of austerity: self-purification and spiritual growth.\n\n**Embracing True Austerity**\n-------------------------\n\nTo practice true austerity, one must:\n\n*   **Strive for Self-Purification**: Engage in selfless activities that promote spiritual growth and purification.\n*   **Avoid Material Motives**: Refrain from using austerity as a means to gain honor, power, or material rewards.\n\nBy understanding the true nature of austerity and its potential misuses, we can cultivate a deeper appreciation for this powerful tool and harness it to achieve our spiritual growth."

    "explanation": "# Mūḍha Grāheṇāt\n## Definition and Interpretation\n\n17.19 Mūḍha grāheṇāt refers to people with confused notions or ideas, who in the name of austerity, heedlessly torture themselves or even injure others without any respect for the teachings of the scriptures or the limits of the body.\n\n### Characteristics of Mūḍha Grāheṇāt\n- **Lack of understanding**: They have confused notions or ideas about the path to spiritual growth.\n- **Heedless self-torture**: They torture themselves in the name of austerity, without any regard for their physical well-being.\n- **Injury to others**: In some cases, they even injure others, disregarding the scriptures and their own physical limitations.\n- **Negative consequences**: Such austerities accomplish nothing positive and only serve to propagate the grossness of their personality.\n\n### Observations on Mūḍha Grāheṇāt\n\nSuch austerities are performed in bodily consciousness, meaning they are carried out under a heightened sense of awareness and attachment to the physical body. This serves only to further entangle them in their own egoistic tendencies, rather than helping them achieve spiritual growth or self-realization."

It is an act of duty to give according to one's capacity.\n\n### Quotes from Sacred Texts\n\nAccording to the Bhaviṣhya Purāṇ:\n\n\"dānamekaṁ kalau yuge\" [v5]\n\"In the age of Kali, giving in charity is the means for purification.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Ramayan states:\n\n\"pragaṭa chāri pada dharma ke kali mahuñ ek pradhāna\njena kena bidhi dīnheṅ dāna karai kalyāna\" [v6]\n\"Give in charity by whatever means possible, for it is the most important dharma in the age of Kali.\"\n\n### The Four Basic Tenets of Dharma\n\nDharma has four basic tenets, one amongst which is the most important in the age of Kali—give in charity by whatever means possible.\n\n### Benefits of Charity\n\nThe act of charity bestows many benefits. It:\n\n*   Reduces the attachment of the giver toward material objects\n*   Develops the attitude of service\n*   Expands the heart, and fosters the sentiment of compassion for others\n\n### Injunction of Giving Away One-Tenth of Earnings\n\nMost religious traditions follow the injunction of giving away one-tenth of one's earnings in charity.\n\nAccording to the Skandh Purāṇ:\n\n\"nyāyopārjita vittasya daśhamānśhena dhīmataḥ\nkartavyo viniyogaśhcha īśhvaraprityarthameva cha\" [v7]\n\"From the wealth you have earned by rightful means, take out one-tenth, and as a matter of duty, give it away in charity. Dedicate your charity for the pleasure of God.\"\n\n### Classification of Charity\n\nCharity is classified as proper or improper, superior or inferior, according to the factors mentioned by Shree Krishna in this verse.\n\n### Qualities of Charity\n\nWhen it is offered freely from the heart to worthy recipients, at the proper time, and at the appropriate place, it is bequeathed to be in the mode of goodness."

    "explanation": "**Types of Charity Attitudes**\n=====================================\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita describes three different attitudes towards charity, each classified according to the mode of passion.\n\n### 1. Giving without Being Asked\n\nThe best attitude of charity is to give without even being asked to do so. This selfless giving is considered the most superior form of charity.\n\n\n### 2. Giving upon Request\n\nThe second-best attitude is to give happily upon being requested for it. While this act of charity brings happiness and satisfaction, it is not as selfless as giving without being asked.\n\n\n### 3. Giving Begrudgingly\n\nThe third-best sentiment of charity is to give begrudgingly, having being asked for a donation. This type of giving is motivated by external factors, such as expectation or obligation.\n\n\n**Classification in the Mode of Passion**\n------------------------------------------\n\nShree Krishna classifies this kind of charity in the mode of passion. According to him, acts of charity motivated by passion are less pure and less beneficial than those performed in the modes of goodness, beauty, or ignorance.\n\n### Quotes\n\n* \"The best attitude of charity is to give without even being asked to do so.\" (Bhagavad Gita)\n* \"Shree Krishna classifies this kind of charity in the mode of passion.\" (Bhagavad Gita)"

    "explanation": "**The Futility of Charity Done Out of Ignorance**\n\nCharity in the mode of ignorance is done without consideration of proper place, person, attitude, or time. No beneficial purpose is served by it.\n\n**A Misguided Attempt**\n\nFor example, if money is offered to an alcoholic, who uses it to get inebriated, and then ends up committing a murder, the murderer will definitely be punished according to the law of karma. However, this does not justify the actions of the person who gave the charity.\n\n**Consequences for Both Parties**\n\nBut, unfortunately, this is an example of charity in the mode of ignorance that is given to an undeserving person. The person who receives the charity will still be responsible for their own actions, and the person who gave the charity will also be culpable for the offense.\n\n**Implications of Ignorance**\n\nThis highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of a person's character and intentions before extending charity. Charity done out of ignorance can lead to unintended consequences, harming both the giver and receiver in the process.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- Charity should be given with consideration of proper place, person, attitude, or time.\n- Ignorance about a person's character and intentions can lead to detrimental consequences for both parties involved.\n- A carefully thought-out approach is necessary when deciding who and how much to give charity."

The mode of passion excites the living being and binds it in innumerable desires.\n\n**The Mode of Goodness**\n\nThe mode of goodness is serene and illuminating, and engenders the development of virtues. However, it is also within the realm of Maya.\n\n**The Limitations of the Mode of Goodness**\n\nWe must not get attached to it; instead, we must use the mode of goodness as a stepping-stone to reach the transcendental platform.\n\n**Transcending the Three Guṇas**\n\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna goes beyond the three guṇas (modes of material nature), and discusses the words Om Tat Sat, which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth.\n\n**The Significance of Om Tat Sat**\n\nIn the following verses, he explains the significance of these three words.\n\n**Key Points to Recall**\n\n- The mode of ignorance degrades the soul.\n- The mode of passion excites and binds with desires.\n- The mode of goodness is serene, illuminating, and virtuous but also within the realm of Maya.\n- The mode of goodness is a stepping-stone to reach the transcendental platform, not an attachment point.\n- The words Om Tat Sat symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth."

Doubt is also like an untamed horse that runs wild in the mind and destroys the garden of devotion.\n\nArjun indicates, “Just as you slayed the Keshi demon, please slay the demon of doubt in my mind.” His question is penetrating and poignant. He wishes to know the nature of two fundamental concepts in Hindu philosophy:\n\n*   **Sanyās**: Renunciation of actions\n*   **Tyāg**: Renunciation of desires for enjoying the fruits of actions\n\nHe also uses the word **pṛithak**, meaning difference; he wishes to understand the distinction between the two terms.\n\nArjun also refers to Shree Krishna as Hrishikesh, meaning “master of the senses.” Arjun’s goal is to accomplish the greatest of conquests, which is to subdue the mind and the senses. It is this conquest that can bestow the state of perfect peace.\n\nAnd the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, as the Master of the senses, himself embodies this state of perfection.\n\n**A Recap of Previous Discussions**\n\nThis topic had been explained in the previous chapters as well. Shree Krishna had talked about:\n\n*   **Sanyās**: Renunciation of actions\n    *   In verses 5.13 and 9.28\n*   **Tyāg**: Renunciation of desires for enjoying the fruits of actions\n    *   In verses 4.20 and 12.11\n\nHowever, he explains it here from another angle. The same truth permits itself to be presented from a variety of perspectives and each perspective provides its own unique appeal.\n\nFor example, various sections of a garden leave differing impressions on the viewer’s mind, while the entire garden creates yet another impression. The Bhagavad Gita is very much like this.\n\nEach chapter is designated as a particular Yog, while the eighteenth chapter is considered the synopsis. In this chapter, Shree Krishna briefly summarizes the perennial principles and eternal truths that were presented in the previous seventeen chapters.\n\n**The Collective Conclusion**\n\nAfter discussing the topics of renunciation and detachment, he goes on to explain the natures of the three **guṇas** and how they affect people’s natural propensities for work.\n\nHe reiterates that the mode of goodness is the only mode worthy of cultivation. He then concludes that **bhakti**, or exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord is the paramount duty, and its attainment is the goal of human life."

They opine that all actions should be abandoned because they are motivated by desire, which promotes further transmigration in the cycle of life and death. They contend that all works are subject to inherent defects, such as indirect violence.\n\nFor example, if one lights a fire, there is always the possibility of insects getting involuntarily burnt in it. Hence, they recommend the path of cessation of all actions, except those for the sustenance of the body.\n\n### Mīmānsā School of Thought\n\nOther learned philosophers, such as those of the **Mīmānsā** school of thought, declare that prescribed Vedic activities should never be given up. They contend that wherever there are two contradictory injunctions of the Vedas, if a specific one is more prominent, it annuls the general one.\n\nFor example, the Vedas instruct us:\n\n> mā hinsyāt sarvā bhūtāni\n> “Do not commit violence toward any living entity.”\n\nThis is a general instruction. The same Vedas also instruct us to perform fire sacrifice. This is a specific instruction. It is possible that in performing a fire sacrifice, some creatures may get killed in the fire unintentionally.\n\nBut the **Mīmānsakas** (followers of the **Mīmānsā** philosophy) contend that the specific instruction for performing the sacrifice prevails, and it must be followed even though it conflicts with the general instruction for not committing violence.

Likewise, it is by giving up lower actions that we can dedicate ourselves to higher duties and activities, and walk the path of enlightenment.\n\n### The Admixed Views on Renunciation\n\nHowever, in the previous verse, Shree Krishna revealed that there are differing views on the true understanding of what renunciation actually entails. Having mentioned the two primary opposing views in the previous verse, Shree Krishna now reveals his opinion, which is the final verdict on the subject.\n\n### Expounding Upon Renunciation\n\nHe says that he will expound upon the subject by dividing renunciation into three categories (described in verses 7 to 9). He addresses Arjun as vyāghra, meaning “tiger amongst men” because renunciation is for the brave-hearted.\n\n**Saint Kabir's Perspective**\n-----------------------------\n\nSaint Kabir said:\n\n> tīra talavār se jo laṛai, so śhūravīra nahīṅ hoya\n> māyā taji bhakti kare, śhūra kahāvai soya\n[v2]\n>\n> “One is not brave by virtue of fighting with arrows and swords; that person is truly brave who renounces Maya and engages in bhakti.”\n\n**The True Meaning of Renunciation**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIn essence, Saint Kabir emphasizes that true bravery lies not in the physical courage to fight with arrows and swords, but rather in renouncing Maya (illusion) and engaging in bhakti (devotion). It is only by letting go of our attachment to lower desires and actions that we can truly cultivate higher aspirations and dedicate ourselves to higher duties and activities."

She does not lose by giving to the child, rather she fulfills her motherhood.\n\nSimilarly, a cow grazes grass in the meadow all day long, but yields the milk in her udder to her calf. The cow does not become any less by performing its duty; on the other hand, people hold it in greater respect.\n\n**The Value of Selfless Actions**\n\nBecause these activities are performed selflessly, they are viewed as sacred. Shree Krishna states in this verse that the wise should perform auspicious and beneficial acts in the same attitude of selflessness.\n\n**Three Kinds of Renunciation Explained**\n\nHe now explains the three kinds of renunciation in the following three verses.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   Acts of sacrifice, charity, and penance should be done in the mood of devotion to the Supreme Lord.\n*   Selfless actions are viewed as sacred and should be performed with a sense of duty, without desire for reward.\n*   The wise should perform auspicious and beneficial acts in the same attitude of selflessness as a mother or cow."

Prescribed duties help purify the mind and elevate it from:\n\n*   **Tamo Guṇa** (Darkness)\n*   **Rajo Guṇa** (Light)\n*   **Sattva Guṇa** (Purity)\n\nAbandoning them is an erroneous display of foolishness. Shree Krishna states that giving up prescribed duties in the name of renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.\n\n### Obligatory Duties and Personal Growth\n\nHaving come in this world, we all have obligatory duties. Fulfilling them helps develop many qualities in an individual, such as:\n\n*   Responsibility\n*   Discipline of the mind and senses\n*   Tolerance of pain and hardships\n\nAbandoning them, out of ignorance, leads to the degradation of the soul.\n\n### The Evolution of Obligatory Duties\n\nThese obligatory duties vary according to one’s level of consciousness. For an ordinary person, acts such as:\n\n*   Earning wealth\n*   Taking care of the family\n*   Bathing\n*   Eating\n\nare prescribed duties. As one gets elevated, these obligatory duties change. For an elevated soul, sacrifice, charity, and penance are the duties.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n*   Prescribed duties help purify the mind and elevate it.\n*   Abandoning prescribed duties is an erroneous display of foolishness.\n*   Obligatory duties help develop qualities like responsibility and discipline.\n*   The nature of obligatory duties changes with one's level of consciousness."

    "explanation": "**The Bhagavad Gita: A Call to Action**\n=====================================\n\n### Verse Explanation\n\n18.8 To advance in life does not mean abandoning our responsibilities, instead it entails increasing them. Novice spiritualists often do not understand this truth. Wishing to avoid pain and taking an escapist attitude, they make spiritual aspiration a pretext for relinquishing their obligatory duties. However, life is never meant to be without burdens.\n\n**Advanced Sādhaks**\n----------------\n\nAdvanced spiritual practitioners, or sādhaks, are not those who are undisturbed because they do nothing, on the contrary, they retain their peace despite upholding a huge burden placed upon their shoulders. Shree Krishna declares in this verse that giving up duties because they are troublesome is renunciation in the mode of passion.\n\n**A Call to Action**\n------------------\n\nFrom the beginning, the Bhagavad Gita is a call for action. Arjun finds his duty unpleasant and bothersome and, as a result, wishes to run away from the battlefield. Shree Krishna calls this ignorance and weakness. He encourages Arjun to continue doing his duty, even though it may be unpleasant, while simultaneously bringing about an internal transformation within him.\n\n**The Role of Spiritual Knowledge**\n---------------------------------\n\nFor this purpose, he enlightens Arjun with spiritual knowledge and helps him develop the eyes of wisdom. Having heard the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun does not change his profession, but changes the consciousness he brings to bear upon his activities.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n* Advancing in life requires increasing responsibilities, not abandoning them.\n* Advanced sādhaks retain their peace despite burdens and do not run from challenges.\n* The Bhagavad Gita is a call to action, encouraging us to fulfill our duties despite their unpleasantness.\n* Spiritual knowledge and wisdom are essential for internal transformation and fulfilling one's duties with devotion to God.\n\n**The Transformation**\n-------------------\n\nArjun changes the consciousness he brings to bear upon his activities, shifting from a motive of comfort and glory to an act of devotion to God. This transformation is a direct result of Arjun's internal growth and development, facilitated by Shree Krishna's guidance."

    "explanation": "**The Superior Kind of Renunciation**\n======================================\n\n18.9 Shree Krishna now describes the superior kind of renunciation, where we continue to perform our obligatory duties, but give up attachment to the fruit of actions. He describes this as the highest kind of renunciation, which is situated in the mode of goodness (sāttvic).\n\n**The Necessity of Renunciation**\n--------------------------------\n\nRenunciation is definitely necessary for spiritual attainment. But the problem is that people’s understanding of renunciation is very shallow and they consider it to be only the external abandonment of works. Such renunciation leads to hypocrisy in which, while externally donning the robes of a renunciant, one internally contemplates upon the objects of the senses.\n\n**The Flaw in Shallow Renunciation**\n--------------------------------------\n\nThere are many sadhus in India who come in this category. They left the world with the noble intention of God-realization, but because the mind was not yet detached from the objects of their senses, their renunciation did not bestow the desired fruits. Consequently, they found their actions did not lead them to a higher spiritual life at all.\n\n**The Defect in the Sequence**\n-----------------------------\n\nThe defect was in their sequence—they strove first for external renunciation and later for internal detachment. This is a mistake, as the instruction of this verse is to reverse the sequence—first develop internal detachment and then renounce externally.\n\n**The Instruction of This Verse**\n---------------------------------\n\nThe instruction of this verse is to reverse the sequence—first develop internal detachment and then renounce externally. By doing so, one can achieve true spiritual growth and attain the desired fruits of renunciation."

They simply do their duty under all conditions, without feeling elated when the going is good or feeling dejected when life becomes tough. They are not like a dry leaf that is tossed hither and tither by every passing breeze. Instead, they are like the reeds in the sea, gently negotiating every rising and falling wave.\n\n### Characteristics of Sāttvic Renunciation\n\n*   They remain equanimous in all situations\n*   They do not get attached to desirable or undesirable circumstances\n*   They perform their duties without feeling elated or dejected\n\n**Real-Life Examples of Sāttvic Renunciation**\n\nBal Gangadhar Tilak was a scholar of the Bhagavad Gita and a famous karm yogi. He was at the forefront of the freedom struggle of India before Mahatma Gandhi came on the scene.\n\n#### Position in Independent India\n\nWhen asked what position he would choose if India became independent—Prime Minister or Foreign Minister? He replied, “My ambition was to write a book on Differential Calculus. I will fulfill it.”\n\n#### Maintaining Composure in Turbulent Situations\n\n*   **Emotional Balance**: He remained calm and composed, even in the face of turmoil. When arrested by the police for creating unrest, he asked his friend to find out the provisions under which he was arrested.\n*   **Internal Composure**: He continued performing his actions without getting emotionally wrought. When his elder son fell ill, he asked the clerk to get a doctor instead of getting emotionally distressed.\n*   **Prioritizing Duties**: He continued working in his office and even called for a doctor to see his son without losing focus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe instances reveal how he retained his composure despite being in the midst of tumultuous situations. He was able to continue performing his actions because of the internal emotional composure; had he been emotionally distressed, he would have been unable to sleep in the jail cell or concentrate on his work at the office."

    "explanation": "**The Concept of Renunciation**\n\nIt may be contended that better than renouncing the fruits of actions is to simply renounce all actions, for then there will be no distraction from meditation and contemplation. Shree Krishna rejects this as a possible option by stating that the state of complete inactivity is impossible for the embodied being.\n\n**The Impossibility of Complete Inactivity**\n\nThe basic functions for the maintenance of the body, such as eating, sleeping, bathing, etc., have to be performed by everyone. Besides, standing, sitting, thinking, walking, talking, etc., are also activities that cannot be avoided.\n\n**Understanding Renunciation**\n\nIf we understand renunciation to be the external abandonment of works, then no one can ever be truly renounced. However, Shree Krishna states here that if one can give up attachment to the fruits of actions, it is considered perfect renunciation.\n\n**Key Principles of Renunciation**\n\n*   The state of complete inactivity is impossible for the embodied being.\n*   Basic functions such as eating, sleeping, and bathing must be performed by everyone.\n*   Activities like standing, sitting, thinking, and walking cannot be avoided.\n*   True renunciation requires giving up attachment to the fruits of actions."

    "explanation": "**The Three Kinds of Rewards**\n\nAccording to the Bhagavad Gita (18.12), the soul reap three kinds of rewards after death:\n\n### Rewards for Virtuous Actions\n\n* **Pleasant Experiences**: Those who perform virtuous actions are awarded the celestial realms.\n* **Unpleasant Experiences**: Those who perform unrighteous actions are given birth in the nether realms.\n* **Mixed Experiences**: Those who perform a mixture of both come back to the human realm.\n\n### The Importance of Desire\n\nHowever, this applies only when the actions are performed with a desire for rewards. When such fruitive desire is renounced and work is done merely as a duty to God, then no such results accrue from actions.\n\n### A Similar Rule in the World\n\nA similar rule exists in the world as well. If one person kills another, it is considered murder, which is a crime that can even result in the death sentence.\n\n### The Exception\n\nHowever, if the government declares that someone is a notorious murderer or thief who is wanted dead or alive, then killing such a person is not considered an offense in the eyes of the law. Instead, it is rewarded by the government, and the killer is even respected as a national hero.\n\n### The Role of Desire\n\nSimilarly, when we give up personal motive in our actions, then the three-fold fruits of actions do not accrue. As the Bhagavad Gita states, when we perform actions without a desire for rewards, then the results of those actions do not come back to us."

    "explanation": "**Adhiṣhṭhānam, Kartā, and the Soul**\n=====================================\n\nIn this verse, two key terms are used to explain the concept of actions: adhiṣhṭhānam and kartā.\n\n### Adhiṣhṭhānam (Place of Residence)\n\nAdhiṣhṭhānam means \"place of residence,\" and refers to the body, since karmas can only be performed when the soul is situated in the body.\n\n### Kartā (The Doer)\n\nKartā means \"the doer,\" and refers to the soul. Although the soul itself does not perform actions, it inspires the body-mind-intellect mechanism with the life force to act. Furthermore, it identifies with their actions, due to the influence of the ego. Therefore, it is responsible for the actions performed by the body, and it is called both the knower and the doer.\n\n**Scriptural References**\n-------------------------\n\nThe Praśhna Upaniṣhad states:\n\n> eṣha hi draṣhṭā spraṣhṭā śhrotā ghrātā rasayitā mantā boddhā kartā vijñānātmā puruṣhaḥ sa pare ’kṣhara ātmani saṁpratiṣhṭhate\n> (4.9)[v3]\n> “It is the soul that sees, touches, hears, feels, tastes, thinks, and comprehends. Thus, the soul is to be considered both—the knower and the doer of actions.”\n\nThe Brahma Sūtra also states:\n\n> jño ‘ta eva\n> (2.3.18)[v4]\n> “It is truly the soul that is the knower.”\n\nAnd again:\n\n> kartā śhāstrārthavattvāt\n> (2.3.33)[v5]\n> “The soul is the doer of actions, and this is confirmed by the scriptures.”\n\n**The Role of Senses**\n----------------------\n\nThe senses are instruments used for performing actions. Without the senses, the soul could not have experienced the sensations of taste, touch, sight, smell, or sound. There are also the five working senses—hands, legs, voice, genitals, and anus. It is with their help that the soul accomplishes various kinds of work.\n\n**The Importance of Effort**\n-----------------------------\n\nDespite all the instruments of action, if one does not put in effort, nothing is ever done. In fact, effort is so important that Chanakya Pandit states in his Neeti Sūtras:\n\n> utsāhavatāṁ śhatravopi vaśhībhavanti\n> [v6]\n> “With sufficient effort, even poor destiny can be transformed into good fortune.”\n\nAnd without proper effort:\n\n> nirutvāhād daivaṁ patita\n> [v7]\n> “Without proper effort, even good destiny can be converted into misfortune.”\n\n**Cheṣhṭhā (Effort)**\n---------------------\n\nCheṣhṭhā, or effort, is another ingredient of action.\n\n**God as the Witness**\n---------------------\n\nGod is seated within the body of the living being as the witness. Based upon their past karmas, he also bestows different abilities to different people to perform actions. One may call this Divine Providence.\n\n**Examples of God-given Talents**\n---------------------------------\n\nSome people possess special intellects, such as the ability to earn huge amounts of wealth. Their acquaintances become astonished by their brilliant financial analysis of complex situations, and they seem to be lucky with the risks they take.\n\nOthers possess God-given talents in fields such as sports, music, art, literature, etc. It is believed that God bestows people these special abilities in accordance with their past karmas, and also grants the results of the present karmas.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nIn conclusion, the verse emphasizes the importance of adhiṣhṭhānam (the body as a place of residence) and kartā (the soul as the doer). It also highlights the role of senses, effort, and God in performing actions. By understanding these concepts, we can gain a deeper insight into the nature of reality and our place within it."

Here's an explanation of his words:\n\n### Unshackling the Bonds of Karma\n\nShree Krishna explains that those with a purified intellect are free from the false pride of being the doer. They also do not seek to enjoy the fruits of their actions, thus avoiding the karmic reactions that bind us. This is evident in verse 5.10, where Shree Krishna states that those detached from results are never tainted by sin.\n\n#### The Dual Perspective of Karma\n\nFrom a material perspective, it may seem that individuals are working hard, but from a spiritual perspective, they are free from selfish motivations. This freedom allows them to transcend the results of karma, unshackling themselves from its bonds.\n\n### The Poetic Saint Rahim Khankhana\n\nRahim Khankhana, a famous poet saint during the Mughal period in Indian history, was a devoted follower of Lord Krishna. He had a distinctive habit of lowering his eyes when giving alms in charity.\n\n### A Humorous Incidence\n\nA sweet incident related to Rahim's habit of giving alms is as follows:\n\n quote\n“Sir, where did you learn to give alms like this? Your hands are as high as your eyes are low.” \n[v13]\nRahim replied beautifully and in all humbleness:\n“The giver is someone else, giving day and night. But the world gives me the credit, and so I lower my eyes.” \n[v14]\n \n\n### The True Nature of the Giver\n\nRahim's response reveals the true nature of the giver. He understands that we are not the sole cause responsible for our accomplishments, freeing us from the egoistic pride of doership. By acknowledging this, we can transcend the bounds of karma and find true peace.\n\n**The Significance of Devotion**\n-----------------------------\n\nRahim's devotion to Lord Krishna is a testament to the transformative power of faith. His story serves as a reminder that spiritual growth is possible when we surrender to the divine will and recognize our true nature."

    "explanation": "**The Science of Action: Understanding the Limbs and Karmic Reactions**\n\nIn his systematic treatment of the science of action, Shree Krishna explained its limbs. He also explained the karmic reactions of actions, and the process of becoming free from them. Now, he discusses the three-fold factors that propel actions. These are:\n\n*   **Jñāna** (Knowledge)\n*   **Jñeya** (The object of knowledge)\n*   **Jñātā** (The knower)\n\nTogether, the three are called the **Jñāna tripuṭī** (Trirod of Knowledge).\n\n### The Triad of Knowledge\n\n“Knowledge” is a primary impetus for action; it provides understanding to the “knower” about the “object of knowledge.” This triad jointly induces action. For example, knowledge of the remuneration to be paid by the employer motivates employees to work; information of the discovery of gold in various parts of the world led to gold rushes involving feverish migration by workers; awareness of the importance of winning a medal in the Olympics motivates sportspersons to practice for years. Knowledge also has a correlation to the quality of work. For instance, a degree from a top college carries weight in the job market. Corporations realize that people with higher quality knowledge can perform work more proficiently. That’s why good corporations invest in the development of their people, such as sponsoring employees for developmental seminars to further advance their skill set.\n\n### The Triad of Action\n\nThe second set named is the **Karm tripuṭī** (Triad of Action). It includes the:\n\n*   **Kartā** (Doer)\n*   **Kāraṇ** (The instrument of action)\n*   **Karm** (The act itself)\n\nThis triad of work jointly constitutes the content of action. The “doer” utilizes the “instruments of action” to perform “the action.” Having analyzed the constituents of action, Shree Krishna now relates them to the three modes of material nature, to explain why people differ from each other in their motives and actions."

A fragment is one with its whole, just as flames are one with the fire of which they are tiny parts.\n\n#### 2. Vijātīya bhed śhūnya\n(He is one with all dissimilar entities.)\n\n* Dissimilar to God is Maya, which is insentient, while God is sentient. However, Maya is an energy of God, and energy is one with its energetic, just as the energies of fire—heat and light—are non-different from it.\n\n#### 3. Swagat bhed śhūnya\n(The various parts of his body are non-different from him.)\n\n* The amazing thing about God’s body is that all the parts perform the functions of all the other parts. The Brahma Samhitā states:\naṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛitti-manti paśhyanti pānti kalayanti chiraṁ jaganti \n(5.32)[v17]\n“With every limb of his body, God can see, hear, talk, smell, eat, and think.” Hence, all the limbs of God’s body are non-different from him.\n\n#### 4. Swayam siddha\n(He needs the support of no other entity.)\n\n* Maya and the soul are both dependent upon God for their existence. If he did not energize them, they would cease to exist. On the other hand, God is supremely independent and does not need the support of any other entity for his existence.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Shree Krishna**\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Supreme Lord Shree Krishna satisfies all the four above points, and thus he is the:\n\nadvaya jñāna tattva\n,in other words, he is everything that exists in creation.\n\n**The Understanding of Unity**\n---------------------------\n\nWith this understanding, when we see the entire creation in its unity with God, it is considered:\n\nsāttvic\nknowledge. And love based upon such knowledge is not racial or national, rather it is universal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe unity behind creation is a profound truth that reveals the oneness of everything. By understanding this unity, we can develop love and devotion for all living beings, transcending racial and national boundaries."

    "explanation": "Proper Action: A Discussion of Philosophical Perspectives\n===========================================================\n\nShree Krishna now describes the three kinds of action after explaining the three kinds of knowledge. In the passage of history, many social scientists and philosophers have given their opinion regarding what is proper action. A few of the important ones and their philosophies are mentioned here.\n\nPhilosophy of Epicureans\n-------------------------\n\nThe Epicureans of Greece (third century BC) believed that to \"eat, drink, and be merry\" was right action.\n\n*   They advocated for a carefree existence where individuals pursue their own desires without any external constraints.\n    *   This philosophy was based on the idea that people should live for their own pleasure and not be bothered with the concerns of others.\n\nPhilosophy of Hobbs, Helvetius, and Butler\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMore refined was the philosophy of Hobbs of England (1588 – 1679) and Helvetius of France (1715 – 1771). They said that if everyone becomes selfish and does not think of others, there will be chaos in the world.\n\n*   They recommended that along with personal sense gratification we should also care for others.\n    *   For example, if the husband is sick, the wife should take care of him; and if the wife is sick, the husband should take care of her.\n    *   In the case where helping others conflicts with the self-interest, they advised that self-interest should be given the priority.\n\nPhilosophy of Butler\n--------------------\n\nJoseph Butler's (1692 – 1752) philosophy went beyond this. He said that the idea of service to others after catering to our own self-interest was wrong.\n\n*   Helping others is a natural human virtue.\n    *   Even a lioness feeds her cubs while remaining hungry herself.\n*   Service to others must always take priority, but Butler's concept of service was limited to the alleviation of material suffering; for example, if a person is hungry, he should be fed.\n    *   But this does not really solve problems because after six hours the person is hungry again.\n\nPhilosophy of Bentham and Mill\n------------------------------\n\nAfter Butler came Jeremy Bentham (1748 – 1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806 – 1873). They recommended the utilitarian principle of doing what is best for the majority.\n\n*   They suggested following the majority opinion for determining proper behavior.\n    *   But if the majority is wrong or misguided, then this philosophy falls through.\n    *   For even a thousand ignorant people together cannot match the quality of thought of one learned person.\n\nAlternative Perspectives on Proper Action\n-----------------------------------------\n\nOther philosophers recommended following the dictates of the conscience. They suggested that it is the best guide in determining proper behavior.\n\n*   However, the problem is that everyone's conscience guides differently.\n    *   Even in one family, two children have different moral values and conscience.\n*   Besides, even one person's conscience changes over time.\n    *   If a murderer is asked whether he feels bad on killing people, he replies, \"Initially I would feel bad, but later it became as trivial as killing mosquitoes. I feel no remorse.\"\n\nProper Action According to the Mahabharat\n------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the Mahabharat states:\n\nātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet\nśhrutiḥ smṛitiḥ sadāchāraḥ svasya cha priyamātmanaḥ \n(5.15.17)[v18]\n\n\"If you do not like it when others behave with you in a certain way, then do not behave with them in that way either. But always verify that your behavior is in accordance with the scriptures.\"\n\nConduct yourself with others as you desire them to behave with you.\n\nThe Bible also says, \"Do to others as you would have them do to you.\" (Luke 6.31)[v19]\n\nHere, Shree Krishna declares that action in the mode of goodness is doing one's duty in accordance with the scriptures.\n\nHe further adds that such work should be without attachment or aversion, and without desire to enjoy the results."

Their mind is blotted with negative obsessions and thus they are **ayuktaḥ** (undisciplined). The scriptures give injunctions regarding what is proper and improper behavior. But workers in the mode of ignorance are **stabdhaḥ** (obstinate in their views), for they have closed their ears and mind to reason. Thus, they are often **śhaṭhaḥ** (cunning) and **naiṣhkṛitikaḥ** (dishonest or vile) in their ways. They are **prākṛitaḥ** (vulgar) because they do not believe in controlling their animal instinct. Though they may have duties to perform, they see effort as laborious and painful, and so they are **alasaḥ** (slothful) and **dīrgha-sūtrī** (procrastinating). Their ignoble and base thoughts impact them more than anyone else, making them **viṣhādī** (unhappy and morose).\n\n**The Three Modes of Nature: A Classification**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam also describes types of performers of actions:\n\n*   **Sattvikaḥ** (nature: calm, composed and self-controlled) - The worker who is detached is **sāttvic** in nature; the one who is excessively attached to action and its results is **rājasic** (passionate); one who is devoid of discrimination is **tāmasic** (ignorant).\n*   workers in the mode of knowledge are **sattvic**; those who are excessively attached to action and result are **rājasic**; those who have closed their ears and mind to reason are **tāmasic**.\n*   **The Three Modes**\n\n    *   **Sattvikaḥ (Calm, Composed and Self-Controlled)** - Detached workers with a nature that is calm, composed, and self-controlled.\n    *   **Rājasic (Passionate)** - Workers excessively attached to action and its results, with a nature that is passionate.\n    *   **Tāmasic (Ignorant)** - Workers devoid of discrimination, with a nature that is ignorant.\n\n**The Nature of the Worker Who is Surrendered to Me**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut, as Shree Krishna says in verse 25 of the Bhagavatam:\n\n\"The worker who is detached is **sāttvic** in nature; the one who is excessively attached to action and its results is **rājasic**; one who is devoid of discrimination is **tāmasic**. But the worker who is surrendered to me is transcendental to the three modes.\"\n\nThis verse highlights that workers who are transcendent of the three modes, meaning they have a nature that is calm, composed and self-controlled; are more likely to work in the mode of knowledge."

These are the intellect and determination.\n\n### The Two Factors that Impact Work\n\nThere are two factors that significantly impact the quality and quantity of work. These factors not only initiate action but also guide and control it.\n\n#### The Intellect\n\nThe intellect is the faculty of discrimination that distinguishes between right and wrong.\n\n### Classifications of the Intellect\n\nThe intellect is of three kinds in accordance with the modes of nature (guna).\n\n#### The Determination\n\nDhṛiti is the inner determination to persist in accomplishing the work undertaken, despite hardships and obstacles on the way.\n\n### Classifications of Determination\n\nDhṛiti is also of three kinds in accordance with the modes of nature (guna).\n\n### Discussion on Both Faculties\n\nShree Krishna now discusses both these faculties and their three-fold classifications.\n\n#### Key Points to Note\n- The two factors that impact work are intellect and determination.\n- The intellect is the faculty of discrimination, distinguishing between right and wrong.\n- Dhṛiti is the inner determination to persist in work despite hardships and obstacles.\n- Both intellect and determination are of three kinds in accordance with the modes of nature (guna).\n- Shree Krishna discusses both faculties and their classifications."

The Bhagavad Gita itself was spoken to Arjun to equip him with the power of discrimination.\n\n### A Personal Struggle with Discrimination\n\nAt the outset, Arjun was confused about his duty. His inordinate attachment to his relatives had bewildered his judgment regarding proper and improper action. Feeling weak and fearful, and in utter confusion, he had surrendered to the Lord and requested him to enlighten him regarding his duty.\n\n**Developing Discernment**\n----------------------\n\nThrough the divine song of wisdom, Lord Krishna helped Arjun develop his power of discrimination, until he finally concluded: “I have explained to you the knowledge that is more secret than all secrets. Ponder over it deeply, and then do as you wish.”\n\n**The Mode of Goodness**\n---------------------\n\nThe mode of goodness illumines the intellect with the light of knowledge thereby refining its ability to discriminate the right and wrong of things, actions, and sentiments.\n\n### The Sattvic Intellect\n-----------------------\n\nThe sāttvic intellect is one that makes known to us what type of action is to be performed and what type of action is to be renounced, what is to be feared and what is to be ignored.

Parents in North India encourage children to eat it, saying:\n\n### Quoting Shree Krishna\n\nāmle kā khāyā aur baḍoṅ kā kahā, bād meṅ patā chalatā hai \n[v20.1] “The benefits of both these—eating of \nāmlā\n and the advice of the elders—are experienced in the future.” Interestingly, after eating the \nāmlā\n, in just a couple of minutes, the bitter taste disappears and sweetness is experienced.\n\n### The Sweet and Bitter Taste of Happiness\n\nInterestingly, the verse also draws a parallel between the bitter taste of the Indian gooseberry and the happiness in the mode of goodness. In this context, Shree Krishna says that happiness in the mode of goodness is of the same nature; it seems bitter in the short-run, but it tastes like nectar in the end.\n\n### The Vedas and Happiness\n\nThe Vedas refer to happiness in the mode of goodness as \nśhreya\n, which is unpleasant in the present but ultimately beneficial. In contrast to this is \npreya\n, which is pleasant in the beginning but ultimately harmful.\n\n### The Kaṭhopaniṣhad on Happiness\n\nRegarding \nśhreya\n and \npreya\n, the Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:\n\nanyachchhreyo ’nyadutaiva preyaste ubhe nānārthe puruṣhaṁ sinītaḥ\ntayoḥ śhreya ādadānasya sādhu bhavati hīyate ’rthādya u preyo vṽriṇīte\nśhreyo hi dhīro ’bhi preyaso vṽriṇīte preyo mando yogakṣhemād vṛinīte (1.2.1-2)\n[v21]\n\n### Final Insights\n\n”There are two paths—one is the ‘beneficial’ and the other is the ‘pleasant’. These two lead humans to very different ends. The pleasant is enjoyable in the beginning, but it ends in pain. The ignorant are snared to the pleasant and perish.\n\nBut the wise are not deceived by its attractions, choose the beneficial, and finally attain happiness.”"

    "explanation": "**The Nature of Rājasic Happiness**\n=====================================\n\nRājasic happiness is experienced as a thrill that arises from the contact between the senses and their objects, but the joy is as short-lived as the contact itself, and leaves in its wake greed, anxiety, guilt, and a thickening of the material illusion.\n\n**Consequences of Indulging Rājasic Happiness**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEven in the material realm, for meaningful accomplishment, it is necessary to reject rājasic happiness. This rejection is essential to steer us away from immediate but misleading joys.\n\n**A Reminder from Jawaharlal Nehru**\n--------------------------------------\n\nIndia's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, used to keep these lines from the poem \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" on his desk as a reminder:\n\n### The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,\n### But I have promises to keep,\n### And miles to go before I sleep.\n\n### And miles to go before I sleep.\n\nThis poem serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of prioritizing meaningful accomplishments over fleeting indulgences.\n\n**The Path to Lasting Bliss**\n---------------------------\n\nThe path to lasting and divine bliss lies not in indulgence, but in renunciation, austerities, and discipline. By letting go of our attachment to temporary pleasures and cultivating self-discipline, we can transcend the limitations of rājasic happiness and achieve a more profound sense of fulfillment."

    "explanation": "**The Perfect Profession: A Scientific Approach**\n=====================================================\n\nAccording to Shree Krishna, finding the perfect profession is like finding a perfect life-partner. But how do we discover the perfect profession for ourselves? To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of 'guṇas' and how they determine an individual's nature.\n\n**Understanding Guṇas**\n----------------------\n\nThe 'guṇas' are the qualities that constitute a person's personality. These guṇas can be broadly classified into three categories: sattva (peaceful, calm, and composed), rajas (active, dynamic, and passionate), and tamas (cold, dull, and inactive). Each guṇa has its own set of characteristics, which in turn determine an individual's natural qualities and work preferences.\n\n**The Four Aśhrams**\n--------------------\n\nIn the system of varṇāśhram, there are four stages in life: Brahmacharya āśhram (student life), Gṛihastha �āśhram (household life), Vānaprastha āśhram (semi-renounced life), and Sanyās āśhram (renounced order). Each stage is characterized by specific duties and occupations.\n\n### Brahmacharya āśhram (Student Life)\n\n*   Duration: From birth till the age of 25\n*   Duties:\n    *   Student life\n    *   Learning and self-improvement\n\n### Gṛihastha āśhram (Household Life)\n\n*   Duration: From the age of 25 till 50\n*   Duties:\n    *   Regular married life\n    *   Family responsibilities\n\n### Vānaprastha āśhram (Semi-Renounced Life)\n\n*   Duration: From the age of 50 till 75\n*   Duties:\n    *   Practice renunciation\n    *   Live with the family\n\n### Sanyās āśhram (Renounced Order)\n\n*   Duration: From the age of 75 onward\n*   Duties:\n    *   Give up all household duties\n    *   Reside in a holy place\n\n**The Four Varṇas**\n---------------------\n\nIn the system of varṇāśhram, there are four occupational categories: Brahmin (priestly class), Kshatriya (warrior and administrative class), Vaishya (mercantile and farming class), and Shudra (worker class). These varṇas were not considered higher or lower amongst themselves.\n\n** Unity in Diversity**\n-------------------------\n\nThe system of varṇāśhram recognizes the diversity in human natures and scientifically prescribes duties and occupations matching people's natures. Just as the limbs of our body have different functions, so do human beings. Expecting all people to perform the same functions is futile.\n\n**The Deterioration of Varṇāśhram**\n-------------------------------------\n\nHowever, over time the system of varṇāśhram deteriorated and its basis changed from one's nature to one's birth. This led to the propagation of upper and lower castes, with the upper castes looking down upon the lower ones.\n\n**The Original Intention of Varṇāśhram**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis was not the original intention of the varṇāśhram system. The real intention was to create a society where people worked according to their intrinsic qualities, sustaining themselves and society, and progressing toward God-realization.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Mapping of Guṇas**\n-------------------------------------\n\nIn the next few verses, Shree Krishna maps the guṇas of people with their natural qualities of work. This will help us understand how our individual guṇas determine our work preferences.\n\n**The Four Guṇas**\n------------------\n\nShree Krishna will map the following guṇas with their natural qualities of work:\n\n1.  Sattva (peaceful, calm, and composed)\n2.  Rajas (active, dynamic, and passionate)\n3.  Tamas (cold, dull, and inactive)\n\nBy understanding the guṇas and how they determine an individual's nature, we can find our perfect profession and live a successful life.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe system of varṇāśhram is a scientific approach to understanding human nature and finding one's perfect profession. By acknowledging the diversity in human natures, we can create a society where people work according to their intrinsic qualities, sustaining themselves and society."

    "explanation": "**18.46: A Message of Perfection**\n=====================================\n\nNo soul is superfluous in God’s creation. His divine plan is for the gradual perfection of all living beings. We all fit into his scheme like tiny cogs in the giant wheel. And he does not expect more from us than the competence he has given to us.\n\nTherefore, if we can simply perform our \nswa-dharma\n in accordance with our nature and position in life, we will participate in his divine plan for our purification. When done in devotional consciousness our work itself becomes a form of worship.\n\n**A Story to Illustrate the Importance of Consciousness**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nA powerful story illustrating that no duty is ugly or impure, and it is only the consciousness with which we do it that determines its worth, was told to Yudhishthir by Sage Markandeya, in the Vana Parva of the Mahabharat.\n\nThe story goes that a young \nsanyāsī\n went into the forest, where he meditated and performed austerities for a long time. A few years went by, and one day a crow’s droppings fell upon him from the tree above. He looked angrily at the bird, and it fell dead on the ground.\n\nThe \nsanyāsī\n realized he had developed mystical powers as a result of his austerities. He became filled with pride. Shortly thereafter, he went to a house to beg for alms.\n\n**The Story Unfolds**\n--------------------\n\nThe housewife came to the door, and requested him to wait a while, since she was nursing her sick husband. This angered the monk and he glanced angrily at her, thinking, “You wretched woman, how dare you make me wait! You do not know my powers.”\n\nReading his mind, the woman replied, “Do not look at me with such anger. I am not a crow to be burnt by your glance.” The monk was shocked, and asked how she knew about the incident? \n\nThe housewife said she did not practice any austerities, but did her duties with devotion and dedication. By virtue of it, she had been illumined and was able to read his mind.\n\nShe then asked him to meet a righteous butcher who lived in the town of Mithila, and said that he would answer his questions on \ndharma\n. The \nsanyāsī\n overcame his initial hesitation of speaking to a lowly butcher, and went to Mithila.\n\n**The Lesson Learned**\n----------------------\n\nThe righteous butcher then explained to him that we all have our respective \nswa-dharma\n, based upon our past karmas and competence. But if we discharge our natural duty, renouncing the desire for personal gain and rising above the fleeting happiness and misery coming our way, we will purify ourselves and graduate to the next class of \ndharma\n.\n\nIn this manner, by doing the prescribed duties and not running away from them, the soul gradually evolves from its present gross consciousness to divine consciousness. The lecture the butcher delivered is known as the Vyadha Gita of the Mahabharat.\n\n**Applicability to Arjun**\n-------------------------\n\nThis message is particularly applicable to Arjun because he wanted to run away from his \ndharma\n, thinking it is painful and miserable. In this verse, Shree Krishna instructs him that by doing his prescribed duty in proper consciousness he will be worshipping the Supreme, and will easily attain perfection."

    "explanation": "### The Significance of Performing Our Dharma\n\n#### Understanding the Concept of Swa-Dharma\n\n18.47 When we do our **swa-dharma** (prescribed occupational duties), there is a two-fold advantage. It is in tune with our disposition. Hence, it is as natural to our personality as flying is to a bird and swimming is to a fish. Secondly, since it is comfortable to the mind, it can almost be done involuntarily, and the consciousness becomes free to be engaged in devotion.\n\n#### The Consequences of Abandoning Our Duties\n\nInstead, if we abandon our duties thinking them to be defective, and take up another’s duties unsuitable for our nature, we struggle against the innate inclination of our personality. This was exactly Arjun’s situation. His **Kshatriya** nature was inclined to military and administrative activities. Events drove him to a situation where it was necessary to participate in a war of righteousness. If he were to shirk from his duty and withdraw from the battlefield to practice austerities in the forest, it would not help him spiritually, for even in the forest, he would not be able to get away from his inherent nature. In all likelihood, he would gather the tribal people in the jungle and become their king. Instead, it would be better for him to continue doing his duty born of his nature, and worship God by offering the fruits of his works to him.\n\n#### The Evolution of Swa-Dharma\n\nWhen one becomes spiritually accomplished, the **swa-dharma** changes. It no longer remains at the bodily platform; it becomes the **dharma** of the soul, which is devotion to God. At that stage, one is justified in giving up occupational duties and engaging wholeheartedly in devotion because that is now the **swa-dharma** of one’s nature. For people with that eligibility, Shree Krishna will give the final conclusion in the end of the **Bhagavad Gita**: “Give up all varieties of **dharmas** and simply surrender unto me.” (18.66) However, until that stage is reached, the instruction given in this verse applies.\n\n#### The Instruction from the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam\n\nThe **Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam** states:\n\n\n### tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatā\n\n\n### mat-kathā-śhravaṇādau vā śhraddhā yāvan na jāyate\n(11.20.9)[v23]\n\n\n“We must keep doing our prescribed occupational duties as long as the taste for devotion through hearing, chanting, and meditating on the **leelas** of God has not developed.”"

    "explanation": "**The Imperfections of Duty**\n=====================================\n\nPeople sometimes recoil from their duty because they see a defect in it. Here, Shree Krishna states that no work is free from defect, just as fire naturally has smoke on top of it. For example, we cannot breathe without killing millions of microbes. If we cultivate the land, we destroy innumerable microorganisms. If we succeed against competition in business, we deprive others of wealth. When we eat, we deprive another of food. Since swa-dharma entails activity, it cannot be devoid of defects.\n\n### The Benefits of Swa-Dharma\n-----------------------------------\n\nBut the benefits of the swa-dharma far outweigh its defects. And the foremost benefit is that it provides a comfortable and natural path for one's purification and elevation.\n\n### A Study on Follow Your Passion\n-------------------------------------\n\nMark Albion, a professor at the Harvard Business School, cites a study in which the careers of 1,500 business school graduates were tracked from 1960 to 1980. From the beginning, graduates were grouped in two categories.\n\n#### Category A: Make Money First\n-----------------------------------\n\nIn category A, those who said they wanted to make money first, so that they could do what they really wanted to do later, after they had taken care of their financial concerns. Unfortunately, 83% fell into this category.\n\n#### Category B: Pursue Your Interests First\n---------------------------------------------\n\nIn contrast, 17% came in category B, where those who pursued their interests first, sure that money would eventually follow. The outcomes were striking: after 20 years, there were 101 millionaires. One person was from category A (who wanted to make money first), and one hundred from category B (who pursued their interest first).\n\n### The Power of Doing What You Love\n-----------------------------------------\n\nMark Albion concludes that for most people, there is a difference between work and play. But if they do what they love, then work becomes play, and they never have to work for another day in their life. That is what Shree Krishna is asking Arjun to do—not to abandon the work that is best suited to his nature, even if it has defects in it, rather to work according to his natural propensity.\n\n**The Importance of Consciousness**\n---------------------------------------\n\nBut for work to be elevating, it must be done in the proper consciousness, described in the next verse."

    "explanation": "**Chapter 18: The State of Actionlessness**\n=====================================================\n\nIn this last chapter, Shree Krishna repeats many of the principles he has already explained. In the beginning of this chapter, he explained to Arjun that merely running away from the responsibilities of life is not sanyās, nor is it renunciation. Now he describes the state of actionlessness, or naiṣhkarmya-siddhi.\n\n**What is Actionlessness?**\n-------------------------\n\nThis state can be reached even amidst the flow of the world by detaching ourselves from events and outcomes, and simply focusing on doing our duty. This is just as water flowing under a bridge enters from one side and flows out from the other. The bridge is neither the recipient of the water nor its distributor; it remains unaffected by its flow.\n\n### The Karm Yogis' Mindset\n\nLikewise, the karm yogis do their duty, but keep the mind unaffected by the stream of events. They do not neglect putting in their best efforts in doing their duty, as an act of worship to God, but they leave the final outcome in his hands, and are thus contented and undisturbed with whatever happens.\n\n**A Story to Illustrate Actionlessness**\n--------------------------------------\n\nHere's a simple story to illustrate this point. A man had two daughters; the first was married to a farmer and the second was married to a brick kiln owner. One day, the father rang up the first daughter and inquired how she was doing. She replied, \"Father, we are going through economic hardships. Please pray to God for us that we may have plentiful rains in the coming months.\"\n\nHe then rang up the second daughter, and she requested, \"Father, we are low on funds. Please request God not to send rains this year, so that we may have lots of sunshine and a good production of bricks.\" The father heard the opposite requests of his daughters, and thought, \"God alone knows what is best. Let him do what he feels is best.\"\n\n### The Power of Detachment\n\nSuch acceptance of the will of God brings detachment from outcomes, despite being immersed in the incessant stream of events in the world. This is the key to achieving actionlessness, and it allows us to focus on our duty without being swayed by the outcome."

The senses are restrained, and the impulses of the body and speech are tenaciously disciplined.\n\n#### Key Qualities\n\n*   The mind is controlled\n*   Senses are restrained\n*   Impulses of the body and speech are disciplined\n*   Activities for bodily maintenance (e.g., eating, sleeping) are wisely held in balance\n\n### The Contemplative Yogi\n\nSuch a yogi is deeply contemplative and hence prefers solitude. This allows us to focus on our inner selves, free from external distractions.\n\n#### Characteristics of the Contemplative Yogi\n\n*   Deeply contemplative\n*   Prefers solitude\n*   Focuses on the inner self\n\n### The State of Perfection\n\nIn this state, the ego and its lust for power and prestige are dissolved. Constantly engaging the mind in transcendence, the yogi is tranquil and free from the bonds of desire, anger, and greed.\n\n#### Benefits of the State of Perfection\n\n*   The ego is dissolved\n*   Tranquil and free from desire, anger, and greed\n\n### Realization of the Absolute Truth\n\nSuch a yogi attains realization of the Absolute Truth, **Brahman**. This is achieved by cultivating a deep understanding of the self and the universe.\n\n#### The Goal of Realization\n\n*   Attain realization of the Absolute Truth, **Brahman**"

    "explanation": "**The Realization of Brahman and the Path of Bhakti**\n\nShree Krishna concludes his description of the stage of perfection in **Brahma-bhūtaḥ**, meaning the state of Brahman realization. Situated in it, one is **prasannātmā**, meaning serene and unaffected by turbid and painful experiences. **Na śhochati** means one does not grieve nor feel any incompleteness, and **Na kāṅkṣhati** means one does not crave for any material thing to make one's happiness complete. In such a state, one is situated on the platform of realized knowledge.\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna concludes the verse with a twist. He states that in such a realized state of knowledge, one then attains **parā bhakti** (divine love) for God.\n\nThe **jñānīs** often fond of saying that **bhakti** is only to be done as an intermediate step toward Brahman realization. They claim that **bhakti** is for the purpose of purifying the heart, and at the end of the journey, only **jñāna** remains. Thus, they recommend that those who possess a strong intellect can ignore devotion and simply cultivate knowledge.\n\nBut the above verse negates such a viewpoint. Shree Krishna states that having attained the highest realization of **jñāna**, one develops **parā bhakti**.\n\n**Examples from the Four Yugas**\n\nThere are many examples of renowned **jñānīs** who had attained self-knowledge and were situated in the realization of the formless Brahman. However, when they got a glimpse of the transcendental divine qualities of God, they naturally got drawn toward **bhakti**.\n\n### Satya Yuga\n\nThe greatest **jñānīs** in Satya Yuga were the four sons of Brahma—Sanat Kumar, Sanatan Kumar, Sanak Kumar, and Sanandan Kumar. They were self-realized from birth and their minds were always absorbed in the formless Brahman.\n\nThese four brothers once visited Vaikunth, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. There, the fragrance from the **tulsī** (holy basil) leaves at the lotus feet of the Lord entered their nostrils, causing a thrill of ecstasy in their hearts. Immediately, their meditation on the attributeless Brahman ended, and they were immersed in the bliss of divine love for Lord Vishnu.\n\n**Incapable of Ignoring Devotion**\n\nKing Janak, the topmost **jñānī** in Treta Yuga, was known as Videha, one who was beyond all perceptions of the body. His mind would remain ever absorbed in the formless Brahman.\n\nOne day, however, Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, along with Lord Ram and Lakshman. What took place then is described in the Ramayana:\n\n\"Inhaling the fragrance of Lord Ram, King Janak became detached from the bliss of the formless Brahman, and deeply attached to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.\"\n\nIn this manner, the greatest **jñānī** of the age of Treta came to the path of bhakti.\n\n### Dwapara Yuga\n\nThe topmost **jñānī** in the age of Dwapara was Shukadev, the son of Sage Ved Vyas. He remained in his mother's womb for twelve years, thinking that if he came into the world, the material energy, Maya, would overpower him.\n\nFinally, Sage Narad came and spoke to him through his mother's ear, reassuring him that nothing would happen and he should emerge from the womb. Finally, he emerged, and by his yogic power, he expanded his body to that of a twelve-year old and renounced home to live in the forest.\n\nThere, he soon reached the highest state of **samādhi**. Years went by, and one day Ved Vyas's students were cutting wood in the forest, when they saw him in **samādhi**. They went back and told the Sage about it.\n\nHe told them to recite a verse in Shukadev's ears, describing the beauty of the personal form of Lord Krishna:\n\n\"Barhāpīḍaṁ naṭa-vara-vapuḥ karṇayoḥ karṇikāraṁ\nBibhrad vāsaḥ kanaka-kapiśhaṁ vaijayantīṁ cha mālām\nRandhrān veṇor adhara-sudhayāpūrayan gopa-vṛindair\nVṛindāraṇyaṁ sva-pada-ramaṇaṁ prāviśhad gīta-kīrtiḥ\"\n\n\"Shree Krishna is adorned with a peacock feathered crown upon his head, and exhibits his form as the greatest dancer. His ears are decorated with blue karṇikā flowers. His shawl is the color of brilliant gold. He wears a garland made of vaijayantī beads. He fills the holes of his flute with the nectar from his lips. His praises are sung as he enters Vrindavan, surrounded by his cowherd friends, and the marks of his footprints beautify the earth.\"\n\nShukadev was absorbed in the formless Brahman when the verse entered his ears. Suddenly, the object of his meditation transformed into the enchanting form of Lord Krishna.\n\nHe felt so deeply attracted to the bliss of the personal form of God that he left his **samādhi** and went back to his father, Ved Vyas.\n\n### Kali Yuga\n\nJagadguru Shankaracharya is widely considered the greatest **jñānī** of this age. He is widely acclaimed as the propagator of **advaita vāda** (non-dualism), in which he stated that there is only one entity in existence, which is the nirguṇa (without qualities), nirviśheṣha (attributeless), and nirākār (formless) Brahman.\n\nHowever, many people are unaware that from the age of twenty until he left his body at the age of thirty-two, he wrote hundreds of verses in praise of Lord Krishna, Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Mother Durga, etc.\n\nHe also visited the four **dhāms** (centers of spirituality in the four corners of India) and worshipped deities of the personal forms of God in all of them.\n\nIn Prabodh Sudhākar, he writes:\n\n\"Kāmyopāsanayārthayantyanudinaṁ kiñchitphalaṁ swepsitam\nKechit swargamathāpavargamapare yogādiyajñādibhiḥ\nAsmākaṁ yadunandanāṅghriyugaladhyānāvadhānārthinām\nKiṁ lokena damena kiṃ nṛipatinā swargāpavargaiśhcha kim\"\n\n\"Those who perform righteous actions for the attainment of celestial abodes may do so. Those who desire liberation via the path of jñāna or aṣhṭāṅg yog may pursue that goal. As for me, I want nothing of these two paths. I wish only to engross myself in the nectar of Shree Krishna's lotus feet. I do not desire either worldly or heavenly pleasures, nor do I desire liberation.\"\n\nThe fact is that Shankaracharya was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. What he taught in his **bhāṣhyas** (commentaries) was the need of the times.\n\nWhen he appeared upon the earth, Buddhism was prevailing all over India. In such an environment, to reestablish the faith of the Buddhists in the Vedas, he sidelined devotion while writing his **bhāṣhyas**.\n\nBut later, in the numerous **stutis** (praises) he wrote for the personal forms of God, he revealed his inner devotion.\n\nShankaracharya was thus an example in the age of Kali, of someone who had reached the highest realization of jñāna, and who then did devotion."

Now he says that only through devotion can one come to know God's personality.\n\n**Realization of Brahman**\n-------------------------\n\nPreviously, the jñānī had realized God as the nirguṇa (quality-less), nirviśheṣha (attribute-less), and nirākār (formless) Brahan. However, the jñānī had no realization of the personal form of God.\n\n**The Secret of God's Personal Form**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe secret of God's personal form cannot be known through karma, jñāna (knowledge), aṣhṭāṅg yog (eight-limbed yoga), etc. It is love that opens the door to the impossible and makes way for the inaccessible.\n\n**The Power of Devotion**\n-------------------------\n\nShree Krishna states here that the mystery of God's form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates can only be comprehended through unalloyed devotion. The devotees understand God because they possess the eyes of love.\n\n**An Illustration from the Padma Purāṇ**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Padma Purāṇ mentions a beautiful incident illustrating the above truth.\n\nA tríṣhi by the name of Jabali saw a very effulgent and peaceful maiden meditating in the forest. He requested her to reveal her identity and purpose of meditation.\n\n**The Maiden's Response**\n-------------------------\n\nShe replied:\n\n```text\nbrahmavidyāhamatulā yogiṁdrairyā cha mṛigyate\nsāhaṁ hari padāmbhoja kāmyayā suchiraṁ tapaḥ\ncharāmyasmin vane ghore dhyāyantī puruṣhottamam\nbrahmānandena pūrṇāhaṁ tenānandena tṛiptadhīḥ\ntathāpi śhūnyamātmānaṁ manye kṛiṣhṇaratiṁ vinā\n[v29]\n```\n\n**The Maiden Explains Her State**\n-----------------------------------\n\n\"I am Brahma Vidyā (the science of knowing the self, which ultimately leads to the Brahan realization of God). Great yogis and mystics perform austerities to know me. However, I am myself performing severe austerities to develop love at the lotus feet of the personal form of God.\n\nI am replete and satiated with the bliss of Brahan. Yet, without loving attachment to Lord Krishna, I feel empty and void.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThus, mere knowledge is insufficient for relishing the bliss of the personal form of God. It is through bhakti (devotion) that one enters into this secret and achieves full God-consciousness."

Hence, it is free from the defects of material nature, and is perfect in every way.\n\n> **\"Neither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of Mine.

It has four aspects to it.\n\n*   **Mana (Mind)**: When it creates thoughts, we call it mana or mind.\n*   **Buddhi (Intellect)**: When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi or intellect.\n*   **Chitta (Attachment)**: When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta.\n*   **Ahankār (Ego)**: When it identifies with the attributes of the body and becomes proud, we call it ahankār or ego.\n\n**The Position of the Intellect in Our Internal System**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this internal machinery, the position of the intellect is dominant. It makes decisions, while the mind desires in accordance with those decisions, and the chitta gets attached to the objects of affection.\n\n**Example: The Intellect's Control**\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf the intellect decides that security is the most important thing in the world, then the mind always yearns for security in life. Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect.\n\n*   The CEO shouts at the director.\n*   The director does not shout back, because the intellect realizes that it will cost him the job.\n*   He vents his anger at the manager.\n*   The manager controls himself, despite feeling vexed with the director; but finds release by shouting at the foreman.\n*   The foreman takes it all out at the worker.\n*   The worker purges his frustration on the wife.\n*   The wife shouts at the children.\n\n**The Intellect's Ability to Control the Mind**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn each case, the intellect decides where it is dangerous to get angry and where it does not have repercussions. This example illustrates that as human beings, our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind.\n\n**Cultivating the Intellect**\n-----------------------------\n\nThus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction. This is what Shree Krishna means by buddhi yog — developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work and all things are meant for the pleasure of God.\n\n**Attached to God**\n-------------------\n\nFor such a person of resolute intellect, the chitta easily gets attached to God."

The soul does not lead an independent existence; it is dependent upon God's creation in many ways.\n\n### The Influence of the Three Guṇas\n\nIn the materially bound state, it is under the influence of the three guṇas. The combination of guṇas creates our nature, and according to its dictates, we are compelled to act. Hence, we do not have absolute freedom to say, \"I will do what I like.\"\n\n### Choosing Between Advice and Compulsion\n\nWe have to choose between the good advice of God and the scriptures or the compulsions of our nature. This is evident in an anecdote regarding one's nature.\n\n#### An Anecdote to Illustrate the Point\n\nA soldier retired after thirty years of service and returned to his hometown. One day, he was standing in the coffee shop drinking a cup of tea, when a friend thought of a practical joke.

    "explanation": "**The Necessity of Surrendering to God**\n==============================================\n\nTo attain eternal beatitude and the imperishable abode, one must surrender to God. This article explains the six aspects of surrender and how it can lead to receiving God's divine grace.\n\n### **The Importance of Self-Surrender**\n\nBeing dependent upon God, the soul must also depend upon his grace to get out of its present predicament and attain the ultimate goal. Self-effort will never suffice for this.\n\n### **God's Grace is Not a Whimsical Act**\n\nShree Krishna emphasizes that by his grace, one will attain eternal beatitude and the imperishable abode. However, to receive that grace, the soul must qualify itself by surrendering to God.\n\n### **Qualifying Oneself for God's Grace**\n\nJust like a worldly father does not hand over all his precious possessions to his child until the child becomes responsible enough to utilize them properly, God requires us to surrender and become eligible for his divine grace.\n\n### **Examples of God's Grace**\n\nLet us consider two examples:\n\n*   A father instructs both sons to work hard in the paddy field. One son toils and sweats it out, while the other lies in bed all day long. When the father says, \"Well done my son,\" he gives him $500. However, when the second son does nothing and the father says, \"Never mind,\" he still gives him $500. This may seem unfair, but it teaches us that the first son's motivation to work hard is smothered when God grants his grace without our becoming qualified for it. Similarly, if God grants his grace without our becoming qualified for it, those who became saints in the past will complain that their effort for self-improvement was meaningless.\n\n### **God's Eternal Condition**\n\nGod says, \"I do not behave in this irrational manner. I have an eternal condition on the basis of which I bestow my grace. And I have declared this in all the scriptures.\" The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:\n\n\"yo brahmāṇaṁ vidadhāti pūrvaṁ yo vai vedānśh cha prahiṇoti tasmai\ntaṁ ha devaṁ ātma-buddhi-prakāśhaṁ mumukṣhur vai śharaṇam ahaṁ prapadye\n(6.18)[v30]\n\"We take shelter of that Supreme Being who created Brahma and others. It is by his grace that the soul and intellect get illumined.\"\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:\n\n\"mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarva-dehinām\nyāhi sarvātma-bhāvena mayā syā hy akuto-bhayaḥ\n(11.12.15)[v31]\n\"O Uddhav! Giving up all forms of mundane social and religious conventions, simply surrender unto me, the Supreme Soul of all souls. Only then can you cross over this material ocean and become fearless.\"\n\nShree Krishna also stated it in verse 7.14 of the Bhagavad Gita:\n\n\"My divine energy Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto me cross over it easily.\"\n\nThe Ramayan also says:\n\n\"sanamukha hoi jīva mohi jabahīṅ, janma koṭi agha nāsahiṅ tabahīṅ \n[v32]\n\"The moment the soul surrenders to God, its account of sinful deeds in endless past lifetimes is destroyed by his grace.\"\n\n### **The Six Aspects of Surrender**\n\nTo surrender to God effectively, one must follow the six aspects:\n\n#### 1. Desire According to God's Desire\n\nTo desire only in accordance with the desire of God. By nature, we are his servants, and the duty of a servant is to fulfill the desire of the master. So as surrendered devotees of God, we must make our will conform to the divine will of God. A dry leaf is surrendered to the wind. It does not complain whether the wind lifts it up, takes it forward or backward, or drops it to the ground. Similarly, we too must learn to be happy in the happiness of God.\n\n#### 2. Not Desiring Against God's Desire\n\nNot to desire against the desire of God. Whatever we get in life is a result of our past and present karmas. However, the fruits of the karmas do not come by themselves. God notes them and gives the results at the appropriate time. Since God himself dispenses the results, we must learn to serenely accept them. Usually, when people get wealth, fame, pleasure, and luxuries in the world, they forget to thank God. However, if they get suffering, they blame God for it, \"Why did God do this to me?\" The second aspect of surrender means to not complain about whatever God gives us.\n\n#### 3. Faith that God is Protecting Us\n\nTo have firm faith that God is protecting us. God is the eternal father. He is taking care of all the living beings in creation. There are trillions of ants on the planet earth, and all of them need to eat regularly. Do you ever find that a few thousand ants in your garden have died of starvation? God ensures that they are all provided for. On the other hand, elephants eat mounds of food every day. God provides for them too. Even a worldly father cares and provides for his children. Why then should we doubt whether our eternal father, God, will take care of us or not? To have firm faith in his protection is the third aspect of surrender.\n\n#### 4. Gratitude Toward God\n\nTo maintain an attitude of gratitude toward God. We have received so many priceless gifts from the Lord. The earth that we walk upon, the sunlight with which we see, the air that we breathe, and the water that we drink, are all given to us by God. In fact, it is because of him that we exist; he has brought us to life and imparted consciousness in our soul. We are not paying him any tax in return, but we must at least feel deeply indebted for all that he has given to us. This is the sentiment of gratitude.\n\nThe reverse of this is the sentiment of ungratefulness. For example, a father does so much for his child. The child is told to be grateful to his father for this. But the child responds, \"Why should I be grateful? His father took care of him and he is taking care of me.\" This is ingratitude toward the worldly father. To be grateful toward God, our eternal Father, for all that he has given to us, is the fourth aspect of surrender.\n\n#### 5. Seeing Everything as Belonging to God\n\nTo see everything we possess as belonging to God. God created this entire world; it existed even before we were born, and will continue to exist even after we die. Hence, the true owner of everything is God alone. When we think something belongs to us, we forget the proprietorship of God. Let us say that someone comes into your house when you are not at home. He wears your clothes, takes things out of your refrigerator, eats them, and sleeps on your bed. On returning, you ask indignantly, \"What have you been doing in my house?\" He says, \"I have not damaged anything. I have merely used everything properly. Why are you getting annoyed?\" Similarly, this world and everything in it belongs to God. To remember this and give up our sense of proprietorship is the fifth aspect of surrender.\n\n#### 6. Giving Up Pride\n\nTo give up the pride of having surrendered. If we become proud of the good deeds that we have done, the pride dirties our heart and undoes the good we have done. That is why it is important to keep an attitude of humbleness: \"If I was able to do something nice, it was only because God inspired my intellect in the right direction. Left to myself, I would never have been able to do it.\" To keep such an attitude of humility is the sixth aspect of surrender.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIf we can perfect these six points of surrender in ourselves, we will fulfill God's condition and he will bestow his Grace upon us."

Hence, it is described as secret.\n\n**The Bhagavad Gita: A Revelation of Secret Knowledge**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the second chapter, Shree Krishna had revealed knowledge of the soul, which is guhya or secret knowledge.

Shree Krishna is now concluding the Bhagavad Gita. Having spoken the eighteen chapters, including most secret knowledge to Arjun, he now leaves the choice in Arjun's hands. He says, \"I have revealed to you profound and confidential knowledge. Now the choice is in your hands.\"\n\n**Similarity with Lord Rama's Discourse**\n----------------------------------------\n\nLord Ram made a similar statement to the residents of Ayodhya. He invited them all for his discourse:\n\neka bāra raghunātha bolāe, guru dwija purabāsī saba āe \n(Ramayan) [v34]\n\n\"Once, Lord Ram called all the residents of Ayodhya. Everyone, including Guru Vasishth came to hear him.\" In the discourse, Lord Ram explained to them the purpose of human life and the way to accomplish it. In the end, he concluded:\n\nnahiṅ anīti nahiṅ kachhu prabhutāī, sunahu karahu jo tumhahi sohāī\n (Ramayan) [v35]\n\n\"The advice I have given to you is neither incorrect nor coercive. Listen to it carefully, contemplate over it, and then do what you wish.\"\n\n**The Freedom of Choice**\n-------------------------\n\nThis free will to choose between available alternatives has been given to the soul by God. The freedom of choice is not infinite. One cannot decide, \"I choose to be the most intelligent person in the world.\" Our choices are limited by our past and present karmas. However, we do possess a certain amount of free will, for we are not machines in the hands of God.\n\n**The Dilemma of Free Will**\n-----------------------------\n\nSometimes people question that if God had not given us free will then we would not have done any evil. But then we would not have done anything good either. The opportunity to do good always comes with the danger of doing evil. More importantly, God wants us to love him, and love is only possible when there is a choice.\n\n**The Importance of Free Will**\n--------------------------------\n\nA machine cannot love for it does not have any freedom of choice. God created us with free will and provided us with choices so that we may choose him and thereby exercise our love for him. Even the all-powerful God cannot force the soul to love and surrender to him; this decision has to be made by the soul itself.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nHere, Shree Krishna is calling Arjun's attention to his free will and asking him to choose. We must remember that the freedom of choice is a precious gift from God, and it is up to us to use it wisely."

    "explanation": "**The Role of a Teacher in Sharing Knowledge**\n\nA teacher may know the deepest secret, but he does not necessarily reveal it to the student. Before sharing it, he considers many things, such as:\n\n*   The preparedness of the student to receive it\n*   The ability of the student to comprehend it\n*   The potential benefits that the student can gain from it\n\n### The Teachings of Bhagavad Gita\n\nIn the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun was bewildered by the problems facing him and asked for guidance from Shree Krishna. The Lord enlightened him with great care and consideration, uplifting his understanding a little by little, through the eighteen chapters.\n\n### A Teacher's Confidence in Education\n\nHaving seen Arjun receive the message so well, Shree Krishna now feels confident that he will be able to grasp the final and most profound knowledge as well.\n\n**Shree Krishna's Motivation**\n\nFurther, he says:\n\n> \"iṣhṭo ‘si me dṛḍhamiti\"\n>\n> Meaning, \"I am speaking this to you because you are my very dear friend. So I care for you deeply and sincerely desire your best interest.\"\n\nThis statement highlights Shree Krishna's motivation for sharing knowledge with Arjun, demonstrating his care and concern for the student's well-being."

    "explanation": "**Chapter 9 of Shree Krishna's Teachings: The Essence of Devotion**\n\nIn chapter 9, Shree Krishna had promised Arjun to reveal to him the most secret knowledge, and then gone on to describe the glories of bhakti.\n\n### The Promise Revealed\n\nHere, he repeats the first line of verse 9.34, asking him to engage in his devotion. By developing deep love for Shree Krishna and having his mind always absorbed in exclusive devotion to him, Arjun will be assured of attaining the supreme destination.\n\n### The Perfect Example\n\nThe perfect example of someone completely absorbed in devotion was King Ambarish. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam describes:\n\n**The Mind Absorbed in Divine Love**\n\nsa vai manaḥ kṛiṣṇa-padāravindayor vachāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane\nkarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣhu śhrutiṁ chakārāchyuta-sat-kathodaye\nmukunda-liṅgālaya-darśhane dṛiśhau tad-bhṛitya-gātra-sparśhe ’nga-saṅgamam\nghrāṇaṁ cha tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe śhrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpite\npādau hareḥ kṣhetra-padānusarpaṇe śhiro hṛiṣhīkeśha-padābhivandane\nkāmaṁ cha dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā yathottamaśhloka-janāśhrayā ratiḥ\n\n(9.4.18-20) \n[v36]\n\n“Ambarish absorbed his mind on the lotus feet of Shree Krishna; he used his speech in glorifying the qualities of God, his hands in cleaning the temple, and his ears in hearing the divine pastimes of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the deities; he used his limbs in touching the bodies of the devotees, his nose in smelling the fragrance of the Tulsī (holy basil) leaves offered at the feet of the Lord, and his tongue in tasting prasād (food sanctified by offering to God). He utilized his feet for walking to the holy abodes, and his head in offering obeisance to the lotus feet of God. He offered all paraphernalia, such as garlands and sandalwood, in the service of God. He did all this, not with some selfish motive, but only to attain the selfless service of Lord Krishna, through purification.”\n\n### The Instruction: Engage in Devotion Wholeheartedly\n\nThe instruction to wholeheartedly engage in devotion is the essence of all the scriptures, and the summum bonum of all knowledge. However, this is not the most confidential knowledge that Shree Krishna referred to, for he has already mentioned this earlier.\n\n### The Supreme Secret Revealed\n\nHe now reveals this supreme secret in this next verse."

    "explanation": "**The Teachings of Shree Krishna: Karm Yog and Karm Sanyas**\n===========================================================\n\nShree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously: engage his mind in devotion and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior. This is the principle of **karm yog**, which means doing devotion alongside with his material duty.\n\n### The Principle of Karm Yog\n\nShree Krishna wanted Arjun not to give up his **kshatriya dharma**, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is because the ultimate goal of life is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual **dharma**, which means loving devotional service to God.\n\n### The Principle of Karm Sanyas\n\nHowever, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that for Arjun, there is no need to fulfill even material **dharma**. He can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God, which is the principle of **karm sanyas**.\n\n### Understanding Dharma\n\nTo comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term **dharma**. It comes from the root word **dhṛi**, which means \"responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us\".\n\n#### Two Types of Dharma\n\nThere are two kinds of **dharmas**: material **dharma** and spiritual **dharma**. Material **dharma** is based upon two different understandings of the \"self\". When we identify ourselves as the body, our **dharma** is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms.\n\n#### Apara Dharma vs. Para Dharma\n\nThis is also called **apara dharma** or material **dharma**, and it includes the **dharma** of a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. On the other hand, when we identify ourselves as the soul, our one and only **dharma** becomes loving devotional service to God, which is called **para dharma** or spiritual **dharma**.\n\n### The Consequences of Renouncing Material Dharma\n\nIf one leaves the material **dharma**, it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves material **dharma** and takes the shelter of spiritual **dharma**, it is not a sin.\n\n#### The Five Debts\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts:\n\n1. To the celestial gods\n2. To the sages\n3. To the ancestors\n4. To other humans\n5. To other living beings\n\n#### The Procedure for Releasing Debts\n\nThe **varṇāśhram** system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts.\n\n#### The Power of Spiritual Dharma\n\nBy fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material **dharma** if we are properly situated in spiritual **dharma**.\n\n### The Ultimate Goal\n\nThe ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual **dharma**.\n\n#### The Instruction of Shree Krishna\n\nThe Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states that those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best **sādhus**.\n\n### Examples from scriptures\n\n*   Lord Ram's renunciation of material duties to accompany him in the forest (Ramayan)\n*   Prahlad's statement that God is his Master and everything to him (v40)\n\n### The Teaching of Bhagavad Gita\n\nShree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n#### Initial Instruction\n\nInitially, he instructed Arjun to do **karm**, i.e. his material **dharma** as a warrior (verse 2.31). However, material **dharma** does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back.\n\n#### Instruction of Karm Yog\n\nHe next instructed Arjun to do **karm yog**, i.e. his material **dharma** with the body and spiritual **dharma** with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction of **karm yog** forms the major portion of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n#### Final Instruction\n\nNow in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice **karm sanyas**, i.e. renounce all material **dharma** and simply adopt spiritual **dharma**, which is love for God.\n\n#### Why did Shree Krishna not give this instruction to Arjun earlier?\n\nShree Krishna clearly explains why he did not give this instruction to Arjun earlier.\n\n#### Verse 5.2\n\nIn verse 5.2, Shree Krishna states that **karm yog** is superior to **karm sanyas**, but he clearly explains this in the next verse.\n\n#### Explanation of Verse 5.2\n\nShree Krishna's explanation is as follows:\n\n\"I have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily **dharma** in the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best **sādhus**.\""

    "explanation": "**Understanding Karm Sanyās**\n\n### The Importance of Qualification\n\nIt was explained in the previous verse that if one is situated in loving devotion to God, there is no sin in giving up the material duties. However, there is one problem with this instruction. If we have not yet become established in love for God, and we prematurely give up material duties, we will be neither here nor there.\n\n### The Concept of Karm Sanyās\n\nkarm sanyās is only for those who are qualified for it. And what we are qualified for has to be determined by our Guru, who knows our capabilities and the stringency of the paths. If a student wishes to become a graduate, it will not do to directly go and attend the graduation ceremony. We will have to begin studies sequentially from grade one.\n\n### Who is Eligible for Karm Sanyās?\n\nThe vast majority of people are eligible for karm yog, and it would be a great folly for them to prematurely take karm sanyās. It is better to instruct them to fulfill their bodily dharma and practice devotion alongside.\n\n### Shree Krishna's Teaching\n\nThat is why, in this verse Shree Krishna says that this confidential teaching given by him is not for everyone. Before sharing it with others, we should check their eligibility for this teaching.\n\n### The Importance of Caution\n\nThis word of caution applies specifically for the confidential teachings of the previous verse, and in general, for the entire message of the Bhagavad Gita. If it is explained to someone who is envious of Shree Krishna, that person may respond, “Shree Krishna was very conceited. He kept asking Arjun to glorify him.” By misunderstanding the teachings, the faithless listener will be harmed by the divine message.\n\n### The Padma Purāṇ's Verse\n\nThe Padma Purāṇ also states:\n\naśhraddadhāne vimukhe ’py aśhṛiṇvati yaśh chopadeśhaḥ śhiva-nāmāparādhaḥ\n[v41]\n\n\"By giving transcendental instructions to those who are faithless and averse to God, we cause them to become offenders.\"\n\n### The Consequences of Misunderstanding\n\nHence, Shree Krishna describes the disqualifications for listeners in the above verse."

He was illiterate and could not comprehend his Guru's teaching as the other disciples could. But when Shankaracharya delivered the discourse, he would listen with rapt attention and great faith.\n\n**Sananda's Amazing feat**\n\nOne day, he was washing his Guru's clothes on the other side of the river. It became time for the class, and the other disciples requested, \"Guruji, please begin the class.\" Shankaracharya replied, \"Let us wait; Sananda is not here.\" The disciples urged, \"But Guruji, he cannot understand anything.\" Shankaracharya said, \"That is true; still, he listens with great faith and so I do not wish to disappoint him.\"\n\n**Shankaracharya's Test**\n\nThen, to show the power of faith, Shankaracharya called out, \"Sananda! Please come here.\" On hearing his Guru's words, Sananda did not hesitate. He ran on water. The story goes that wherever he placed his feet, lotus flowers sprang up to support him.\n\n**Sananda's Amazing Journey**\n\nHe crossed over to the other bank and offered obeisance to his Guru. At that time, a stuti (verses in praise) of the Guru emanated from his mouth in sophisticated Sanskrit. The other disciples were amazed to hear this.\n\n**The Name \"Padmapada\"**\n\nSince, lotus flowers had bloomed under his feet, his name became \"Padmapada,\" meaning \"the one with lotus flowers under the feet.\" He became one of the four main disciples of Shankaracharya, along with Sureshwaracharya, Hastamalak, and Trotakacharya.\n\n**The Lesson**\n\nIn the above verse, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that even those who merely hear the sacred dialogue with great faith will gradually become purified.\n\n**Benefits of Faith**\n\nGod is seated within them; he will note their sincere endeavor and reward them for it. The story of Sananda shows that faith can lead to amazing feats and a deeper connection with the divine."

    "explanation": "**The Blinding Impact of Bhagavad Gita**\n\nAt the outset, Arjun was faced with a bewildering situation, and confused about his duty in the situation. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he had sat down on his chariot, and gave up his weapons. He had confessed that he could find no remedy to the grief that attacked his body and senses.\n\nBut he now finds himself completely transformed, and announces that he is situated in knowledge and no longer perplexed. He has given himself to the will of God and shall do what Shree Krishna instructed him to do. This was the impact of the message of Bhagavad Gita upon him.\n\n**The Power of Grace**\n\nHowever, he adds:\n\n\"prasādān mayāchyuta\"\n\nMeaning, “O Shree Krishna, it was not just your lecture, but your grace that dispelled my ignorance.”\n\n**The Nature of Spiritual Knowledge**\n\nMaterial knowledge does not require grace. We can pay the educational institute or teacher and receive knowledge in return, but spiritual knowledge can neither be purchased nor sold. It is offered through grace and received through faith and humbleness.\n\nThus, if we approach the Bhagavad Gita with an attitude of pride, “I am so intelligent. I will evaluate what the net worth of this message is,” we will never be able to comprehend it. Our intellect will find some apparent defect in the scripture to dwell upon, and on that pretext we will reject the entire scripture as incorrect.\n\n**The Difficulty of Spiritual Understanding**\n\nThere have been so many commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and innumerable readers of the divine message in the last 5,000 years, but how many people have become enlightened like Arjun?\n\nIf we wish to truly receive this knowledge, we must not merely read it, but also attract Shree Krishna’s grace with an attitude of faith and loving surrender. Then we will know the purport of the Bhagavad Gita by his grace.\n\n**The Importance of Faith and Humbleness**\n\nTo truly receive the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita, one must approach it with faith and humbleness. The message is not for those who are proud of their intelligence, but for those who can surrender and receive with an open heart.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a message that transcends time and intellect. It requires us to surrender our ego and doubt, and receive its wisdom with faith and humble devotion.\n\nAs Arjun so eloquently puts it:\n\n\"prasādān mayāchyuta\"\n\nIn other words, the true power of Bhagavad Gita lies not in its words or teachings, but in the mercy and grace that it offers us."
