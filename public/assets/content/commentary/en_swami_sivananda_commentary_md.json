He should renounce all possessions.A householder with Yogic tendencies and spiritual inclination\n\n can practise meditation in a solitary and iet room in his own house or any solitary place on the banks of any holy river (during the holidays or throughout the year if he is a wholetime aspirant or if he has retired from service).The practice must be constant. Only then can one attain Selfrealisation surely and ickly. He who practises meditation by fits and starts and for a few minutes daily will not be able to achieve any tangible results in Yoga. The Yogic aspirant should be free from hope\n\n desire and greed. Only then will he have a steady mind. Hope\n\n desire and greed make the mind ever restless and turbulent. They are the enemies of peace and Selfknowledge. The aspirant should not have many possessions either. He can only keep those articles which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of his body. If there are many possessions\n\n the mind will be ever thinking of them and attempting to protect them.It you are well established in the practice of Pratyahara\n\n Sama and Dama (withdrawal of the senses\n\n control of mind and the body respectively)\n\n if you have the senses under your full control\n\n you can find perfect solitude and peace even in the most crowded and noisy place of a big city. If the senses are turbulent\n\n if you have not got the power to withdraw them\n\n you will have no peace of mind even in a solitary cave of the Himalayas. A disciplined Yogi who has controlled the senses and the mind can enjoy peace of mind in a solitary cave. A passionate man who has not controlled the senses and the mind will only be building castles in the air if he lives in a solitary cave in a mountain.He who has reduced his wants\n\n who has not a bit of attraction for the world\n\n who has,discrimination and burning aspiration for liberation\n\n and who has observed Mauna (the vow of silence) for months together will be able to live in a cave.You should have perfect control over the body through the regular practice of Yoga Asanas before you take to serious and constant meditation.Aparigraha means noncovetousness\n\n freedom from possessions.The spiritual aspirant need not bother himself about his bodily needs. Everything is provided by God. Everything is prearranged by Mother Nature. She looks after the bodily needs of all very carefully in a more efficient manner than they themselves would do. She knows beter what the reirements are and provides them then and there. Understand the mysterious ways of Mother Nature and become wise. Be grateful to Her for Her unie kindness\n\n grace and mercy.If you want to retire into solitue for the practice of meditation\n\n and if you are a householder with a thirst for intense spiritual Sadhana\n\n you cannot all of a sudden sever your connection with your family. Sudden severance of worldly ties may produce intense mental agony in you and shock in them. You will have to break the ties gradually. Stay for a week or a month in seclusion to begin with. Then gradually prolong the period. They will not feel the pangs of separation from you.As your will has become very weak\n\n as you had no religious discipline or training in schools and colleges when you were young\n\n and as you are under the sway of materialistic influences\n\n it is necessary for you to go in for seclusion for some days or weeks (during the Chritstmas\n\n Easter or other holidays) to practise rigorous Japa and meditation and to develop your willpower.Those who have fixed up their sons in life and who have retired from service\n\n and who have discharged their duties as householders can remain in seclusion for four or five years and practise intense meditation and Tapas (penance) for selfpurification and Selfrealisation. This is like entering a university for higher studies or postgraduate course of study. When the Tapas is over\n\n and when they have attained to Selfknowledge\n\n they should come out and share their knowledge of the Self with others through lectures\n\n conversations\n\n discourses or hearttoheart talks according to their capacity and disposition.How can sensecontrol be tested in a lonely forest where there are no temptations The Yogic student living in a cave should test himself after he has sufficiently advanced\n\n by coming into the society of people. But he should not test himself every now and then like the man who removed the young plant daily after watering it to see whether it had struck deep root or not.",

Withdraw it from all senseobjects again and again and try to fix it steadily on your Lakshya or point of meditation or centre. Gradually you will have concentration of the mind or onepointedness. You must be very regular in your practice. Only then will you succeed. Regularity is of paramount importance. You should know the ways and habits of the mind through daily introspection\n\n selfanalysis or selfexamination. You should have a knowledge of the laws of the mind. Then it will be easy for you to check the wandering mind. When you sit for meditation\n\n and when you deliberately attempt to forget the worldly objects\n\n all sorts of worldly thoughts will crop up in your mind and disturb your meditation. You will be ite astonished. Old thoughts that you entertained several years ago\n\n and old memories of past enjoyments will bubble up and force the mind to wander in all directions. You will find that the trapdoor of the vast subconscious mind is opened or the lid of the storehouse of thoughts within is lifted up and the thoughts gush out in a continous stream. The more you attempt to still them\n\n the more they will bubble up with redoubled force and strength.Be not discouraged. Nil desperandum. Never despair. Through regular and constant meditation you can purify the subconscious mind and its constant memories. The fire of meditation will burn all thoughts. Be sure of this. Meditation is a potent antidote to annihilate the poisonous worldly thoughts. Be assured of this.Meditation on the immortal Self will act like a dynamite and blow up all thoughts and memories in the conscious mind. If the thoughts trouble you much\n\n do not try to suppress them by force. Be a silent witness as in a bioscope. They will subside gradually. Then try to root them out through regual silent meditation.During introspection you can clearly observe the rapid shifting of the mind from one line of thought to another. Herein lies a chance for you to mould the mind properly and direct the thoughts and the mental energy in the divine channel. You can rearrange the thoughts and make new associations on a new Sattvic basis. You can throw out wordly and useless thoughts. Just as you remove the weeds and throw them out\n\n you can throw these out\n\n and you can cultivate sublime\n\n divine thoughts in the divine garden of your mind. This is a very patient work. This is a stupendous task indeed. But for a Yogi of determination who has the grace of the Lord and an iron will it is nothing.Calm the bubbling emotions\n\n sentiments\n\n instincts and impulses gradually through silent meditation. You can give a new orientation to your feelings by gradual and systematic practice. You can entirely transmute your wordly nature into divine nature. You can exercise supreme control over the nervecurrents\n\n muscles\n\n the five sheaths (of the Self)\n\n emotions\n\n impulses and instincts through meditation.",

You should attain mastery over the Asana (AsanaJaya) by daily practice. You should be as firm as a statue or a rock. If you keep the body\n\n head and neck erect\n\n the spinal cord also will be erect and the Kundalini will rise up steadily through the subtle nervechannel (Nadi) called the Sushumna. Sit in the lotus pose or the adept pose. This will help you in maintaining the nervous eilibrium and mental poise. You should steadily direct your gaze towards the tip of your nose. This is known as the Nasikagra Drishti. The other gaze is the Bhrumadhya Drishti or gazing between the two eyrows where the psychic centre known as the Ajna Chakra is situated. This is described in chapter V\n\n verse 27. In Bhrumadhya Drishti direct the gaze towards the Ajna Chakra with closed eyes. If you practise this with open eyes\n\n it may produce headache. Foreign particles or dust may fall into the eyes. There may be distraction of the mind also. Do not strain the eyes. Practise gently. When you practise concentration at the tip of the nose you will experience DivyaGandha (various aromas). When you concentrate your gaze at the Ajna Chakra you will experience DivyaJyotis (perception of supraphenomenal lights). This is an experience to give you encouragement\n\n push you up in the spiritual path and convince you of the existence of transcendental or supraphysical things. Do not stop your Sadhana. Yogins and those Bhaktas who meditate on Lord Siva concentrate on the Ajna Chakra with the Bhrumadhya Drishti. You can select whichever Drishti suits you best.Though the gaze is directed towards the tip of the nose when the eyes are halfclosed and the eyalls are steady the mind should be fixed only on the self. Therefore you will have to gaze\n\n as it were\n\n at the tip of the nose. In chapter VI\n\n verse 25\n\n the Lord says Having made the mind abide in the Self\n\n let him not think of anything. Gazing at the tip of the nose will soon bring about concentration of the mind.Whichever be the point selected\n\n visualise your own tutelary deity there and feel His Living Presence.",

The most prominent thought of ones life occupies the mind at the time of death. The predominant idea at the time of death is what in normal life has occupied his attention most. The last thought determines the nature or character of the body to be attained next. As a man thinketh\n\n so shall he becometh.The force of Samskaras which one has created by his previous practice is the cause of their remembrance at death. Those who have practised worship of God throughout their life can have remembrance of their tutelary deity at the time of death.The analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar (BhramaraKitaNyaya) can be applied here. The caterpillar constantly remembers the wasp and becomes eventually transformed into a wasp. Even so he who constantly remembers his tutelary deity becomes identical with that deity. Nandikesvara is an example. He constantly thought of his Lord and assumed a form eal to that of the Lord.If you constantly think of the immortal Self during your lifetime\n\n you will entertain the thought of the Self only even at the time of death and will attain immortality. If you always think of your body and identify yourself with the perishable body you will be born again and again. If you think of you pet dog at the time of death you will be born as a dog. Raja Jadabharata thought of his pet deer at the time of his death and so he took the birth of a deer.Every man has a definite outlook on life\n\n definite mode of thinking\n\n definite cravings\n\n desires and hopes\n\n definite character\n\n temperament\n\n taste\n\n disposition and attitude.This is all due to the impressions which have become part and parcel of his subconsciousness. This is all due to experiences which have left their indelible impressions on his mind.He always thinks of his body and physical needs. He searches for his happiness in the external\n\n perishable objects. He identifies himself with the perishable body. He ignores his innermost\n\n allblissful\n\n immortal Self\n\n the source of everything. He trains his body\n\n senses\n\n mind and intellect in worldly pursuits. He ignores the Yogic discipline of the mind and the senses. Therefore he always thinks of his body\n\n bread\n\n drink and clothing. He forgets all about God and the Self\n\n the indweller\n\n an embodiment of bliss and knowledge\n\n fountain of joy and happiness.Desires are endless. Therefore man cannot gratify them in one birth. At the time of death the whole storehouse of impressions and desires is churned out and the most prominent\n\n the strongest and cherished desire comes to the surface of the mind or the field of mental consciousness. This churned up butter or cream (cherished desire) arrests his attention for immediate gratification. He thinks of only that at the time of death. Just as the most vital mango plant shoots up prominently in the nursery\n\n so also the strongest desire shoots up on the surface of the mind. If the desire is not gratified his mind gets saturated with it and it is gratified in his nextbirth. This desire will become very promenent in his next birth.You yourself are the author of your own destiny. You yourself are responsible for your thoughts\n\n character\n\n feelings\n\n actions and experiences. You planted certain worldly desires and Samskaras in your subconscious mind\n\n and allowed them to germinate and grow. If you had planted spiritual aspiration\n\n the desire for liberation and spiritual Samskaras\n\n you would reap the fruit of immortality and eternal bliss. As you sow so shall you reap.He who practises constant and profound meditation on the Self of his own tutelary deity throughout his life will be able to meet death with an unruffled mind. He alone would go to the Supreme\n\n thinking of It at the time of his departure from this world\n\n too. You should have exclusive devotion to God. Your whole mind must be absorbed in Him. You should not allow any outside worldly impressions\n\n wherein there is an iota of selfish desire\n\n to sink into your subconscious mind. Then you can think of the Lord exclusively at the time of death and enter His very Being.",

Just as the tree remains in a latent state in the seed\n\n so also this whole universe remains in a latent state in a seedform in the Mulaprakriti during Pralaya. This is the night of Brahma. This is the cosmic night. Again the world is projected at the beginning of the Mahakalpa (evolution). There comes the cosmic dawn or cosmic day. This eternal rhythm of cosmic day and night (evolution and involution) is kept up in the macrocosm.Nothing that comes under this everrevolving wheel of cosmic day and night lasts for ever. That is the reason why the seers of the Upanishads\n\n the sages of yore\n\n lived in the transcendental Supreme being\n\n the imperishable Self\n\n the indestructible Purusha\n\n the supreme goal of life\n\n the highest end of man\n\n which is beyond the cosmic day and night.

It can hardly be described in words. It can be realised only through direct experience or spiritual intuition. Atman or Brahman or the selfluminous\n\n eternal\n\n Supreme Purusha is ever shining in the chambers of the hearts of men. Throughout the ages there have always been a few who have trodden the spiritual path and found out this secret or the spiritual treasure of the precious pearl of the Self. Knowledge of the Self is the only direct means for attaining liberation\n\n Karma Yoga purifies the heart and leads to the dawn of the knowledge of the Self.Lord Krishna says\n\n O Arjuna\n\n I shall teach you this profoundest secret knowledge combined with realisation as you are free from jealousy. From this we can clearly understand that freedom from jealousy is an important alification for an aspirant. Knowledge can only dawn in a mind which is free from all forms of jealousy which causes great distraction of the mind and produces intense heartburning. Matsarya (malicious envy)\n\n Irshya (jealous of others prosperity or happiness) and Asuya (envious or indignant over the merits of another) are all varieties of jealousy. If you superimpose evil alities on a virtuous man who really does not possess these alities on a virtuous man who really does not possess these alities and speak ill of him\n\n this is jealousy (Asuya). To behold evil or to look at a person with the faultfinding evil eye\n\n and to see evil in him who is free from any kind of fault and who is virtuous is Asyua. Jealousy is only pettymindedness. This is a modification of ignorance. It can be eradicated by eniry of the nature of the Self and cultivating its opposite alities\n\n viz.\n\n nobility\n\n broad and universal tolerance\n\n magnanimity and largeheartedness.To thee who does not carp or cavil This implies that Arjuna was endowed with all the virtues of a disciple such as straightforwardness\n\n selfcontrol\n\n restraint of the senses\n\n serenity of mind\n\n discrmination\n\n dispassion\n\n etc. This is the Upalakshana (the truth alluded to where only a part is stated) and Asuya is the Upalakshaka (the hint which alludes to the Upalakshana).",

It is the science of sciences. Of sciences the highest\n\n of secrets the most profoun\n\n of purifiers the supreme is this. The knowledge of Brahman is the best purifier. It reduces the roots of all Karmas and all the Karmas themselves which have been stored up in the course of many thousands of births\n\n into ashes in the twinkling of an eye. It destroys Avidya along with its effects. An expiatory act (Prayaschitta) cannot destroy all sins. It removes the effect of a single sin\n\n only to some extent. Even if it is removed the effect of that sin remains in a subtle state in the mind and forces him to do sinful acts in his next birth. But the knowledge of the Self destroys ickly all the sins in their gross and subtle states that are accumulated in the course of several thousands of births along with Avidya\n\n their cause. That is the reason why it is a supreme purifier. The causal body of the Jiva is called MulaAvidya (rootignorance). The Avidya or the veil of ignorance that envelops the visible objects of this world is called Sthula Avidya or gross ignorance.The knowledge of the Self is not opposed to Dharma. It is the fruit of all actions done in many births without expectation of fruits. Further\n\n the knowledge of the Absolute can very easily be attained. One may think that this knowledge will perish soon as it is easily obtained\n\n when its effect is exhausted. It is not so. It is imperishable. It is everlasting. It shines for ever by its own Selfeffulgence. He who has tasted this nectar even once becomes immortal. Therefore the knowledge of the Absolute is certainly worth aciring. You will have to strive very hard to attain it anyhow in this birth\n\n as it is very difficult to get a human birth. Strive hard every moment\n\n for life is uncertain and the prize (final liberation) is great.",

How could it be How can the Infinite be contained in a finite object Brahman has no connection or contact with any material object\n\n just as a chair or a table has contact with the ground or a man or a book. So It does not dwell in those beings. That which has no connection or contact with objects or beings cannot be contained anywhere as if in a vessel\n\n trunk\n\n room or receptacle. The Self is not rooted in all these forms. It is not contained by any of these forms just as the ether is not contained in any form though all forms are derived from the ether.All beings appear to be living in Brahman\n\n but this is an illusion. If this illusion vanishes\n\n nothing remains anywhere except Brahman. When ignorance\n\n the cause of this illusion\n\n disappears\n\n the very idea of the existence of these beings also will vanish.In verses 4 and 5 the Lord uses a paradox or an apparent contradiction All beings dwell in Me and yet do not dwell in Me I do not dwell in them. For a thinker there is no real contradiction at all. Just as space contains all beings and yet is not touched by them\n\n so also Para Brahman contains everything and yet is not touched by them.

These objects cannot produce any effect on It.What sort of relationship is there between Brahman and the objects of this universe Is it Samyoga\n\n Samavaya or Tadatmya Sambandha The relationship of the stick with the drum is Samyaoga Sambandha. Let us assume that there is such a Sambandha (relationship or connection). There cannot be connection between all the parts because Brahman is infinite and the elements are finite. You may say that there is connection of the Ekadesa type. This is also not possible\n\n because there can be such relationship only between objects which possess members or parts like the tree and monkey. (Ekadesa is partial). Brahman has no parts.If you say that there is Samavaya Sambandha between Brahman and the objects or the elements\n\n this is also not possible. The relationship between the attribute and the possessors of that attribute is called Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between an individual Brahmin and the whole Brahmin caste is also Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between hand and man\n\n between the leg and the man is also Samavaya Sambandha. Such relationship does not exist between Brahman and the objects or the elements.The third kind of relationship\n\n viz.\n\n Tadatmya Sambandha is seen to exist between milk and water\n\n fire and the iron ball. Milk shares its alities of sweetness and whiteness with water. Fire shares its alities of brilliance\n\n heat and redness with the hot iron ball. This too is not possible between Brahman and the objects or the elements\n\n because Brahman is ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute and allfull and perfect whereas the elements are insentient\n\n finite and painful. How can they with ite contrary alities have Tadatmya Sambandha with BrahmanTherefore it can be admitted that the elemtns have only got Kalpita Sambandha (superimposition) with Brahman. That object which is superimposed on the substratum or support exists in name only. It does not exist in reality. Brahman is the support or the substratum for this world of names and forms. World here includes all beings and their three kinds of bodies (physical\n\n mental and causal). Therefore\n\n the elements or the beings in this world are not really rooted in Brahman. They do not really dwell in Brahman. It is all in name only.Vayu also means Sutratman or Hiranyagarbha. Bhuta also means the individual consciousness. Just as the ether in the pot is not distinct from the universal ether before the origin and after the destruction of the pot and even when the pot exists\n\n and it is of the nature of the universal soul is of the nature of Brahman during the three periods of time\n\n past\n\n present and future.Just as all efects exist in a state of nondifference in their material cause before they appear\n\n during their period of existence and after their destruction\n\n so also the individual souls are not different from Brahman before the origin of the various limiting adjuncts like mind\n\n intellect\n\n etc.\n\n,during the period of their existence and after their destruction.",

They are irresistibly swept away by the temptation of the higher planes (the heaven\n\n and the plane of the celestial beings\n\n etc.). They lose their power of discrimination and right understanding and thery lose themselves in heavenly enjoyments. The dwellers of the higher planes\n\n the shining ones\n\n tempt the aspirants in a variety of ways. They say unto them\n\n O Yogi\n\n we are very much pleased with your austerities and dispassion\n\n spiritual practices and divine alities. This is the plane for your final resting which you have obtained through your merit and your austerities. We are all your servants to obey your orders and carry out your \n\nnds or behests. Here is the celestial car for you. You can move about anywhere you like. Here are the celestial damsels to attend on you. They will please you with their celestial music. Here is the wishfulfilling ree which will give you whatever you want. Here is the celestial nectar in the golden cup\n\n which will make you immortal. Here is the celestial lake of supreme joy. You can swim freely in this lake. The uncautious Yogi is easily carried away by the invitations of the gods and the sweet flowery speeches. He gets false satisfaction or contentment. He thinks that he has reached the highest goal of Yoga. He yields to the templations and his energy is dissipated in various directions. As soon as his merits are exhausted he comes down to this earthplane. He will have to start his upward climb on the spiritual lader once more. But that dispassionate Yogi who is endowed with strong discrimination rejects ruthlessly these invitations from the gods\n\n marches boldly on his spiritual path and stops not till he attains the highest rung on the ladder of Yoga or the highest summit on the hill of knowledge or Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He is fully conscious that enjoyments in heaven are as much worthless as those of this illusory world. The pleasures of heaven are subtle\n\n exceedingly intense and extremely intoxicating. That is the reason why the uncautious\n\n nonvigilant and less dispassionate aspirant yields easily to the temptations of the higher planes. Even in this physical plane\n\n in the West and in America where there is abundance of wealth\n\n plenty of dollars and gold\n\n people enjoy subtle and intense sensual pleasures. Every day scientists bring out new inventions\n\n new forms of sensual pleasures for the gratification of the mischievous and revolting senses. Even an abstemious man of simple habits of India becomes a changed man when he lives in America or Europe for some time. He yields to the temptations. Such is the power of Maya. Such is the influence of temptation. Such is the strength of the senses. That man who is endowed with strong discrimination\n\n sustained dispassion\n\n good selfanalytic power\n\n and burning yearning for liberation\n\n can resist temptations and he aloen can be really happy. He alone can attain the highest goal of life\n\n the final beatitude or the sublime vision of the Infinite.Those who drink the Soma juice are purified from sin.Sacrifices Such as the Agnistoma\n\n Jyotistoma. They worship Me as the Vasus and other deities (Rudras and Adityas) by sacrifices such as the Agnistoma.Indra is the Lord of the gods.

The divine pleasures are the supernatural pleasures of the heaven.DivyaBhoga An enjoyment that is beyond the reach of man or an enjoyment that can be had only by the celestial body of the gods or an enjoyment given by the gods in the heaven.

In Bhakti Yoga the devotee establishes a near and dear relationship with the Lord. He cultivates slowly and one of the five Bhavas (attitudes) according to his temperament\n\n taste and capacity. The five attitudes are the Santa Bhava (the attitutde of peaceful adoration) Dasya Bhava (the attitude of servant towards the master) Sakhya Bhava (the attitude of a friend) Vatsalya Bhava (the attitude of a parent to the child) and Madhurya Bhava (the attitutde of the lover towards the beloved). The devotee adopts these attitudes towards the Lord. The last (Madhurya Bhava) is the culmination of devotion. It is merging or absorption in the Lord.The devotee adores the Lord. He constantly remembers Him (Smarana). He sings His Name (Kirtana). He speaks of His glories. He repeats His Name. He chants His Mantra (Japa). He prays and prostrates himself. He hears His Lilas (divine plays). He does total\n\n ungrudging and unconditional selfsurrender\n\n obtains His grace\n\n hols communion wih\n\n and eventually gets absorbed in Him.The devotee begins by worshipping the idols or the symbols of God. Then he performs internal worship of the Form. Ultimately he is led to the supreme worship of the allpervading Brahman (Para Puja).Thus As declared in the last verse of the previous chapter.Avyaktam The unmanifested\n\n i.e.\n\n incomprehensible to the senses\n\n transcending all limiting adjuncts. The unmanifested Brahman is beyond all limitations. That which is visible to the senses is called Vyakta or manifest.The hearts of the devotees are wholly fixed on Thee. They worship Thee with all their heart and soul.There are others who worship the unmanifested Brahman which is beyond time\n\n space and causation\n\n which is attributeless\n\n which is eternal and indefinable\n\n which is beyond the reach of speech and mind.

That is the reason why he has eal vision. He is like the sun or the river. The sun sheds its light eally on a palace or a cottage. Anyone can drink the water of a river. A river enches the thirst of cows as well as tigers and lions. The idea of mineness and Iness never arises in the devotees mind. He has no sense of mine and thine.

It transforms itself into the body\n\n senses and the sensual objects to serve the two purposes of the individual soul\n\n viz.\n\n Bhoga (enjoyment) and Apavarga (liberation).The Gita is divided into three sections illustrative of the three words of the Mahavakya or Great Sentence of the Sama Veda -- TatTvamAsi (That thou art). In accordance with this view the first six chapters deal with the path of action or Karma Yoga and the nature of the thou (TvamPada). The next six chapters explain the path of devotion or Bhakti Yoga and the nature of That (TatPada). The last six chapters treat of the path of knowledge or Jnana Yoga and the nature of the middle term art (AsiPada) which establishes the identity of the individual and the Supreme Soul (Jiva Brahma Aikyam).Arjuna now wishes to know in detail the difference between Prakriti and Purusha (Matter and Spirit).

The individual souls (Jivatmas) are different but the Supreme Soul (Paramatma) is one. Wherever there is mind\n\n there are lifreath\n\n egoism and the individual consciousness or reflected intelligence side by side. He who has the sense of duality will take birth again and again. This delusion of dulaity can only be removed by knowledge of the identity of the individual soul and the Absolute. I am happy\n\n I am miserable\n\n I am the doer of this action\n\n and I am the enjoyer of this experience -- these are the experiences of all human beings. Therefore the individual soul is bound to Samsara and is subject to pleasure and pain\n\n and the individual souls are in different bodies. But\n\n the Supreme Soul is free from pleasure and pain. It is not bound to Samsara. It is eternally free. It is one without a second.If there is only one individual soul in all bodies\n\n all should have the same experience at the same time. If Rama suffers from abdominal colic\n\n Krishna also should experience the pain at the same time. If John experiences joy\n\n Jacob also should have a similar experience. If Choudhury is stung by a scorpion\n\n Banerjee also should suffer from the pain. But this is not the case. When Rama suffers\n\n Krishna rejoices. When John is jubilan\n\n Jacob is depressed. When Choudhury suffers from the sting of a scorpion\n\n Banerjee is enjoying his breakfast. Fields are different\n\n bodies are different\n\n minds are different and the individual souls are different from each other. But the knower in all these fields is one. Pleasure and pain are the Dharmas (functions) of the mind only. The individual soul is in essence identical with the Supreme Soul.The knower of the field or the Self is not affected by pleasure and pain\n\n virtue and vice. He is the silent witness only. Pleasure and pain are the functions of the mind. They are ascribed to the Self through ignorance. The ignorant man regards the physical body as the Self. He is swayed by the two currents of likes and dislikes\n\n he does virtuous and vicious actions and reaps the fruits of these actions\n\n viz.\n\n pleasure and pain\n\n and takes birth again and again. But the sage who knows that the Kshetrajna or the knower of the field or the Self is distinct from the body is not swayed by likes and dislikes. He identifies himself with the pure\n\n eternal\n\n Absolute or the Supreme Self and is always happy and actionless\n\n though he performs actions for the welfare of humanity.The disease of Timira (partial blindness) which causes perception of what is contrary to truth pertains to the eye but not to the man who perceives. If the disease is removed by proper treatment he perceives things in their true light. Even so ignorance\n\n doubt\n\n pleasure and pain\n\n virtue and vice\n\n likes and dislikes\n\n false perceptions as well as their cause belong to the instrument (the mind) but not to the silent witness\n\n the knower of the field\n\n the Self.In the state of liberation wherein there is annihilation of the mind\n\n there is no ignorance and the play of the two currents of likes and dislikes does not exist there. If false perception\n\n ignorance\n\n pleasure and pain\n\n doubt\n\n bondage\n\n delusion\n\n sorrow\n\n etc.\n\n were the essential properties of the Self\n\n just as heat is the essential property of fire\n\n they could not be got rid of at any time. But there have been sages of Selfrealisation in the past like Sankara\n\n Dattatreya\n\n Jada Bharata and Yajnavalkya who possessed extraordinary supersensual or intuitional knowledge\n\n who were free from false perception\n\n doubt\n\n fear\n\n delusion\n\n sorrow\n\n etc. They were not conscious of Samsara but they had perfect awareness of the Self. Therefore\n\n we will have to conclude that the Self is ever free\n\n pure\n\n perfect\n\n eternal and that ignorance inheres in the instrument (the mind) and not in the Self.Ignorance born of Tamas acts as a veil and prevents man from knowing his essential nature as,the ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute. It causes perception of what is ite the contrary of truth and causes doubt or nonperception of truth. As soon as knowledge of the Self dawns these three forms of ignorance vanish in toto. Therefore these three forms of ignorance are not the attributes of the Self. They belong to the mind\n\n the organ or the instrument. Mind is only an effect or a product of ignorance.The wheel of Samsara or the worldprocess rotates on account of ignorance. It exists only for the ignorant man who perceives the world as it appears to him.There is no Samsara for a liberated sage. Any disease of the eye cannot in any way effect the sun (the dity presiding over the eye). The breaking of the pot will not in any way affect the ether or space in the pot. The water of the mirage cannot render the earth moist. Even so ignorance and its effecs cannot in the least affect the pure\n\n subtle\n\n attributeless\n\n formless\n\n limbless\n\n partless and selfluminous Kshetrajna or the Self. Ignorance does not touch the Self. (Cf.X.20XIII.32XVIII.61)",

The elements here referred to are the subtle\n\n not the gross ones.Egoism is the cause of the great elements. It is the selfarrogating principle. Intellect is the cause of egoism. The function of the intellect is determination. Buddhi is the faculty of determination. The cause of the intellect is the Unmanifested (which is the undifferentiated energy of the Lord). (Cf.VII.14 Daivi hyesha gunamayi mama maya duratyaya  -- This divine illusion of Mine\n\n caused by the alities\n\n is difficult to cross over.) The above Nature is divided eightfold (Cf.VII.4).The ten senses are the five organs of knowledge (ears\n\n skin\n\n eyes\n\n tongue and nose)\n\n so called because they enable the mind to get knowledge of the external world\n\n and the five organs of action (hands\n\n feet\n\n mouth\n\n anus and the generative organ)\n\n so called because they perform actions.The one This is the mind. This is the eleventh sense whose function is thinking and doubting (Sankalpa and Vikalpa).The five objects of the senses are sound\n\n touch\n\n form (colour)\n\n taste and smell. These are the fivefol pastures of the senses.All the great elements\n\n egoism\n\n intellect\n\n the senses and mind are all absorbed in the Unmanifested at the time of the cosmic dissolution.Mind is Maya. Mind is Avidya (ignorance). Mind is at the root of all activities. It gives strength to desires\n\n fosters fear and builds castles in the air. It confers force on egoism and stimultates,aspirations. Every tendency has its origin in the mind. It augments passions\n\n gives strength to hope and awakens the sense of duality. It increases ignorance and plunges the senses in the ocean of senseobjects. It creates distinctions and differences. It separates\n\n divides and limits. It is a strong wall or an iron barrier that stands between the individual soul and the Absolute. It is this mind that has brought Brahman to the condition of the individual soul. It is the storehouse of error\n\n cravings\n\n doubt\n\n delusion and ignorance. It is an everrevolving wheel that generates thoughts. It is a miraculous thoughtproducing machine.

All these are mental states and treated as properties of the body by the Sankhya school of thought. According to the NyayaYaiseshika schools\n\n these are the inherent alities of the Self. The modifications have a beginning and an end. Only that which is unchanging can be the witness of these modifications. The knower of the field is unchanging. He is the witness of the field and its modifications.Desire is a modification of the mind. It is an earnest longing for an object. It is a Vritti (thoughtwave) born of Rajas which urges a man who has once experienced a certain object of pleasure to get hold of it as conducive to his pleasure when he beholds the same object again. This is the property of the inner sense. It is the field because it is knowable.You enjoy a certain sensual object. The impression of this is produced in the subconscious mind. This impression is vivified or revived through memory or remembrance of the sensual pleasure. Then desire arises to enjoy the object again. Repetition of the sensual enjoyment intensifies the memory and desire. Renunciation of the objects and meditation thin out the impressions and the desires.If anyone gives a description of the beautiful scenery of Badri Narayana or Mount Kailasa at once a desire arises in our minds to vist those places. If a man says that very good sweetmeats and mangoes are available in Bangalore\n\n a desire to get these objects crops up in your mind. Therefore memory of sensual enjoyments and the hearing of the alities of the sensual objects are the root causes of desires. Hope fattens the desires. Hope gives a new lease of life to desires. Desire excites the mind and the senses. Desire makes the mind restless. Desire makes the mind wander in the sensual grooves.An object which is sweet and pleasant to you at one moment produces the very reverse of that sensation at another moment. Everyone of you might have had this experience. Objects are pleasant only when there is a longing for them. But they are unpleasant when there is no longing for them. Therefore desires are the cause of pleasure. If satisfaction arises through enjoyment of the objects\n\n pleasure will cease. If your mind is destitute of desires then you will always enjoy serenity\n\n eanimity\n\n balance or poise in spite of many obstalces or adversities. The foundation of desire is the love of sensual pleasures. Desires run along the path of your inclination\n\n proclivity or tendency or taste. Desire is the fuel. Thought is the fire. If you withdraw the fuel of desire\n\n the fire of thought will be extinguished like an oilless lamp. The intellect becomes impure by association with desires.Hatred is a modification of the mind. It is a negative one. It is a Vritti that impels a man who,experienced pain from a certain object to dislike it when he beholds the same object again. Hatred also is field because it is knowable. The modification that arises in the mind when your desire is not fulfilled is called hatred.Pleasure is agreeable\n\n peaceful\n\n made of Sattva. This is also the field because it is knowable.Pain is disagreeable or unpleasant. It is also the field because it is knowable.Sanghata Aggregate\n\n the combination of the body and the senses or the bundle of the 35 components of the body.Chetana Intelligence is a mental state which manifests itself in the aggregate just as fire manifests itself in a ball of iron. This is also the field because it is knowable. Chetana means consciousness and also the activity of the vital airs.Dhriti Firmness\n\n courage\n\n fortitude. It is a Sattvic modification of the mind. The body\n\n the senses and the mind are sustained by firmness when they are depressed and agitated. The five elements are antagonistic to each other. Water destroys earth. Fire dries up water. Water puts out fire. Wind puts out a lamp (fire). Ether absorbs the wind. The five elements fight amongst themselves and yet they (that have a natural dislike for one another) dwell together ite amicably in the same body. Each element beautifully cooperates with the others in carrying on the common functions of the body harmoniously. Each element nourishes the other elements also with its own alities. Dhriti is firmness or the power by which these fighting elements are held in union and harmony and kept in a state of steadiness and balance. This is also the field because it is knowable.Desire and the other alities that are spoken of in this verse stand for all the alities of the mind. The field that is mentioned in the first verse has been dealth with in all its different forms in the fifth and the sixth verses.",

These are the attributes of the man whose mind is turned towards the inner wisdom. If these characteristics are seen in a man in their entirety\n\n you can infer that the knowledge of the Self has dawned in him.Humility It is the negation of vanity. It is absence of selfesteem or selfpraise. The basis of pride is the consciousness of possessing something (wealth\n\n knowledge\n\n strength\n\n beauty and virtuous alities) in a larger measure than others. A proud man possesses at least something but a man of vanity possesses nothing and yet he thinks he is superior to others. Vanity is exaggerated pride. A humble man dislikes respect\n\n honour and praise. He shuns fame and distinction. He never shows his knowledge\n\n ability\n\n prowess\n\n etc. He never praises himself.Absence of hypocrisy Hypocrisy is the desire to appear what one is not. A Sannyasi has some virtues and a little theoretical knowledge derived from books. He pretends to be a liberated sage. This is religious hypocrisy. A man in whom this is absent is simple and modest. He never advertises his own virtuous alities in order to get respect\n\n name and worship from others. He will never disclose any meritorious or charitable act done by him. He is free from pedantry. He will never sell his knowledge in order to achieve fame.Ahimsa Noninjuring of any living being in thought\n\n word and deed. He who practises Ahimsa places his feet very carefully on the ground and avoids stepping on any living creature. If he perceives any living creature in front of him he stops and turns to the other side. His heart is full of compassion.Kshanti Forbearance\n\n patience\n\n forgiveness. This is a true symptom of knowledge. The man of wisdom puts up with everything. He is not affected a bit when others injure him. He never retaliates. He bears insult and injury calmly.Arjavam Straightforwardness. The man of wisdom is upright or straightforward. He is free from cunningness or diplomacy\n\n doubledealing or crookedness. He is ite frank\n\n candid or openhearted. He does not hide anything. His thoughts and words agree. He speaks his mind openly to the people. He is as simple as a child in his speech. He has a heart as pure as a crystal. He never cheats others.Service of the teacher Devotion to the preceptor\n\n worship of the Guru doing acts of service to him who teaches BrahmaVidya or the means of attaining liberation. Acharya is the Master in whom the divine wisdom is embodied. Service of the Guru enables the aspirant to attain Selfrealisation. The aspirant adores his Guru as Brahman\n\n God Himself. He worships him as Lord Vishnu. He superimposes on him all the attributes of Brahman or Lord Vishnu. He realises Brahman in and through his Guru. This is the fruit of devotion to the Guru. For a student of Vedanta devotion to the Guru is absolutely necessary. Even for a correct understanding of the scriptures the guidance of a Guru is necessary.Purity is of two kinds\n\n external and internal purity. External purity is cleansing of the physical body with earth and water. Internal purity is cleansing of the mind of the dirt of attachment\n\n hatred and other passions\n\n by the method of Pratipaksha Bhavana\n\n i.e.\n\n by cultivating the opposite positive virtues\n\n and by the recognition of the evil in all objects of the senses.Steadfastness The aspirant never leaves his efforts on the path of salvation even though he comes across many stumbling blocks on the path. This is steadfastness or firmness. No meditation on Brahman is possible with a fickle mind.Selfcontrol is control of the aggregate of the body and the senses. The senses and the body which naturally run externally towards the sensual objects are checked and directed on to the path of salvation. No meditation is possible in a body wherein the senses are out of control and distract attention.",

These are the evils of birth. The man of wisdom never forgets the troubles of birth\n\n death\n\n old age\n\n etc. He wants to avoid being born. In old age the intellect becomes dull and the memory is lost and the senses become cold and weak. There is decay of power and strength. The old man is treated with contempt by his relatives.

These are the evils caused by sickness.Pain The three types of pain or afflictions are referred to in the Introduction.Pain itself is evil. Birth is painful. Birth is misery. Death is misery. Old age is misery. Sickness is misery. Birth\n\n death\n\n etc.\n\n are all miseries\n\n because they produce misery or pain.By such reflection and perception of the evil in these arises indifference to the pleasures of the body and the sensual pleasures.

There is only one common consciousness is eternal\n\n selfluminous and allpervading. That common consciousness is Para Brahman.The body\n\n mind\n\n senses and the lifeforce are by nature insentient. But they are moved by Brahman to action. They act on account of the mere presence of Brahman or the knower of the field. (The limiting adjuncts are illusory.) Hence they put on the semblance of consciousness\n\n just as the iron piece puts on the semblance of a magnet when it is in the presence of a magnet.The whole world is superimposed on Brahman like the snake on the rope. This is called Adhyaropa. It is sublated by the method (Yukti) of Apavada (negation or denial).This verse is taken from the Svetasvataropanishad 3.16.",

Even so\n\n steps are necessary to reach the summit of the knowledge of the Self. That is the reason why Lord Krishna took Arjuna to the summit of knowledge step by step. He first taught Arjuna the nature of the field\n\n then knowledge\n\n ignorance or nonwisdom\n\n and ultimately the knowable. When a child is to be fed,the intelligent mother divides the food into small portions and feeds the child little by little. Even so Lord Krishna fed His spiritual child Arjuna with the spiritual food little by little.Lord Krishna says O Arjuna I will give you the same teaching in another form by the description of the Spirit and Nature.Till now the Lord expounded the knowledge of the field and the Self in accordance with the philosophy of the Upanishads. Now He explains the same knowledge in accordance with the Sankhya philosophy\n\n but without accepting its dual nature in the form of discrimination between the Spirit and Nature.Vikaras Modifications from the MahatTattva or intellect down to the physical body the twentyfour principles of the Sankhyas. The Self within is changeless. All changes take place in Nature. Mulaprakriti (the Primordial Nature\n\n the Unmanifested) becomes modified into Mahat\n\n egoism\n\n mind\n\n the great elements and other minor modifications.Just as coolness and ice\n\n the day and the night\n\n are inseparable\n\n so also matter and Spirit are inseparable. The three alities Sattva\n\n Rajas and Tamas are born of Nature (matter). All actions proceed from the mind\n\n the lifeforce\n\n the senses and the physical body.According to the Sankhya philosophy\n\n Prakriti and Purusha are not only eternal and beginningless but also independent of each other and selfcreated. According to Vedanta philosophy\n\n Prakriti or Maya originates from Brahman and is\n\n therefore\n\n neither selfcreated nor independent. Isvara has Maya under His perfect control. Maya is His causal body. Maya is His illusory power.Matter and Spirit are the Natures of Isvara. Know that these two are beginningless. That which has no beginning is Anadi. As Isvara is eternal\n\n His two Natures also should be eternal. (This is according to the Sankhyas.)Isvara possesses these two Natures (superior and inferior) by which He causes the creation\n\n preservation and destruction of the universe. Therefore He has the Lordship and rules over the universe. The two Natures have no beginning. Therefore they are the cause of Samsara.The inferior Nature (Apara Prakriti) which consists of the eightfold division of Nature referred to in chapter VII\n\n verse 4\n\n is the Prakriti of chapter XIII\n\n verse 19. The superior Nature (Para Prakriti) referred to in chapter VII\n\n verse 5\n\n is the Purusha of chapter XIII\n\n verse 19. Purusha here means Jiva (the individual soul).Even a child smiles and experiences exhilaration\n\n grief\n\n fear\n\n anger\n\n pleasure and pain. Who taught it The impressions of the virtuous and vicious actions of this birth cannot be the cause of these. The impressions of the previous birth alone are the cause of all these. They (the impressions) must have a support. From this we can clearly infer the existence of the individual soul in the previous birth and that the individual soul is beginningless. If you do not accept that the individual soul is beginningless\n\n the two defects of Kritanasa (nonfruition of actions performed) and Akritabhyagama (causeless effect) will creep in. Pleasure and pain which are the fruits of virtuous and vicious actions done previously will pass away without being experienced. This is the defect of Kritanasa. So also\n\n one will have to enjoy pleasure and pain\n\n the fruits of good and bad actions which were not done by him previously. This is the defect of Akritabhyagama. In order to get rid of these two defects we will have to accept that the individual soul is beginningless. The scriptures,also emphatically declare that the soul is beginningless.",

When Tamas predominates\n\n sinful\n\n unlawful and unrighteous actions are done.In the place of Kaarana (कारण) which means cause\n\n some read Karana (करण) which means instrument such as the five organs of knowledge\n\n five organs of action\n\n mind\n\n intellect and egoism (thirteen principles located in the body).Karya The effect\n\n viz.\n\n the physical body. The five elements which form the body and the five senses\n\n and which form the senseobjects which are born of Nature come under the term effect. All alities\n\n such as pleasure and pain and delusion which are born of Nature\n\n come under the term instruments because these alities reside in the instruments\n\n the senses.In the production of the body\n\n the senses and their sensations Nature is said to be the cause. Thus Nature is the cause of Samsara.Sugarcane is the cause. Sugarcane juice\n\n sugar and sugarcandy are the effects or modifications of sugarcane. Milk is the cause. Curd\n\n butter and ghee (meleted butter) are the modifications of milk. Whatever is a modification of something is its effect\n\n and that from which the modifications come is their cause. Nature is the source or cause of all modifications. She generates everything. The ten organs\n\n mind and the five objects of the senses are the sixteen modifications or effects.Mahat (intellect) is born of Mulaprakriti. From Mahat Ahamkara (egoism) is born. Mahat is the effect of Mulaprakriti and the cause of Ahamkara. Therefore Mahat is called PrakritiVikriti. Mahat\n\n Ahamkara and the five Tanmatras (rootelements of matter) are the seven PrakritiVikriti. Each of these is a modification of its predecessor and is in turn the cause of its successor. The five rootelements generate the five gross elements. They are the subtle elements. These seven are both Nature and modification (Prakriti and Vikriti)\n\n cause and effect\n\n and are included under the term cause.The functions of the body\n\n senses\n\n lifeforce\n\n mind and intellect are superimposed on the pure Self. So the ignorant man says I am black I am fat I am hungry I am angry I am deaf I am blind I am the son of so and so\n\n I know\n\n I am the doer\n\n I am the enjoyer\n\n etc.The intellect is very subtle. It is in close contact with the most subtle Self. The Consciousness of the Self is reflected in the intellect (Chidabhasa) and so the intellect which has the semblance of,the Consciousness feels I am pure consciousness or Chaitanya. I experience pleasure and pain. The attributes of the pure Self are superimposed on the intellect. There is mutual superimposition between the intellect and the Self\n\n Nature and Spirit. This is the cause of Samsara.Purusha\n\n Jiva\n\n Kshetrajna and Bhokta are all synonymous terms. Purusha here referred to is not the Supreme Self. He is the conditioned soul\n\n the soul subject to transmigration who experiences pleasure and pain. The Self or the Absolute is ever free from Samsara and is unchanging.Prakriti and Purusha are the cause of Samsara. Nature generates the body\n\n lifeforce\n\n mind\n\n intellect and the senses. The soul experiences pleasure and pain. Samsara is the experience of pleasure and pain. The soul is the Samsarin. He is the experiencer of pleasure and pain. (Cf.XV.9)",

The self through ignorance identifies itself with the body and suffers rirth.In whatsoever condition he may be\n\n whether he is engaged in prescribed or forbidden acts (like Indra who killed the Purohita Visvarupa and many Sannyasins)\n\n he is not born again\n\n because the,actions (which are the seeds of rirth)\n\n of one who knows the Spirit and Matter\n\n who has gained the knowledge of the Self\n\n are burnt by the fire of that knowledge. Just as the seeds that are fried in fire do not sprout again\n\n so also the actions burnt in the fire of knowledge cannot produce new bodies or further births. In his case they are Karmabhasa (mere semblance of Karma). They are not effective causes and cannot produce further births. A burnt cloth cannot serve the purpose of the cloth.Those actions which are done with egoism and desire (expectation of fruits) will produce fruits or results. In the case of a wise man\n\n the seeds of evil\n\n viz.\n\n ignorance\n\n egoism\n\n attachment\n\n etc.\n\n are burnt by the fire of knowledge. Therefore he cannot have rirths.The Karmas (Prarabdha) which have already started their operation by producing this present birth do not perish\n\n notwithstanding the dawn of the knowledge of the Self. When an arrow is once sent out from a bow at a mark\n\n it pierces the mark and continues to act till it falls to the ground when the full force with which it was dischared is exhausted. Even so the Prarabdha Karma which has given rise to the body continues to act till the inherent force is fully exhausted\n\n although the sage has attained Selfrealisation through his body. But he is not in the least affected by this\n\n because he has no identification with the body\n\n and as he has identified himelf with Brahman or the Absolute. If a carbuncle or cancer arises in the body on account of Prarabdha Karma\n\n he will not suffer a bit as he has risen above bodyconsciousness\n\n and as he stands as a witness of his body. But a bystander or a spectator wrongly imagines that the liberated sage is also suffering like an ordinary worldly man. This is a serious and sad mistake. From the viewpoint of the liberated sage he has neither body nor Prarabdha Karma.An arrow that is placed ready on the bow but not discharged with force can be withdrawn. Similarly\n\n the Karmas which have not begun to generate their fruits or effects can be neutralised or destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. Therefore it is proper to say that the liberated sage is not born again. He will not take another body when the body through which he attained knowledge perishes. As ignorance\n\n the cause of this body\n\n is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self\n\n birth\n\n the effect of ignorance\n\n is also destroyed. As one takes birth through virtuous and vicious actions\n\n a sage will not take birth as his virtuous and visiouc actions (the whole Sanchita or accumulated Karmas of his previous births) are destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. The Karmas done by him after he has attained Selfrealisation cannot touch him at all as he has neither egoism (agency) nor desires. (Cf.XIII.32)",

Then the mind itself is made to abide in the Self through constant meditation on the Self. The mind is refined or purified by meditation. The mind that is rendered pure will naturally move towards the Self. It is not attracted by nor is it attached to the sensual objects.Sankhya Yoga is Jnana Yoga. The aspirant does Vichara (analysis\n\n reflection) and separates himself from the three alities of Nature\n\n the three bodies and the five sheaths and identifies himself with the witness (Self). He thinks and feels\n\n I am distinct from the three alities. I am the silent witness. I am unattached. I am nondoer. I am nonenjoyer. I am immortal\n\n eternal\n\n selfexistent\n\n selfluminous\n\n indivisible\n\n unborn and unchanging.The Karma Yogi surrenders his actions and their fruits to the Lord. He has Isvarapana Buddhi (intelligence that offers everything to God). This produces purity of mind which gives rise to knowledge of the Self. Karma Yoga brings about concentration of the mind through the purification of the mind. It leads to Yoga through the purification of the mind and so it is spoken of as Yoga itself.Those who practise Sankhya Yoga are the highest class of spiritual aspirants. Those who practise the Yoga of meditation are aspirants of the middling class. Those who practise Karma Yoga are the lowest class of spiritual aspirants. The aspirants of the middling and lowest class soon become aspirants of the highest class through rigorous Sadhana or spiritual practices. (Cf.V.5VI.46)",

So She has got the name Mulaprakriti or Primordial Nature or the original principle. From the point of view of the Unmanifest She is called Avyakta. The Vedantins call Her Maya (illusion). The Sankhyas call Her Prakriti.This Prakriti is called great because She is greater than all Her effects. This Nature\n\n made of the three alities\n\n is the material cause of all beings. As She is the source or cause of all Her,modifications and also nourishes all the modifications with Her energy\n\n She is called Brahma.I place in it (the Mahabrahma) the embryo of life then all beings begin to come to life therefrom. In the great Brahma or Nature I place the germ or the seed for the birth of Hiranyagarbha and the seed gives birth to all beings. The birth of Hiranyagarbha or Brahma (the Creator) gives rise to the birth of beings. The Primordial Nature is like the clay. She cannot create the forms Herself. She gives birth to Brahma Who creates all beings just as the potter creates various forms from the clay. I am endowed with the two Saktis\n\n viz.\n\n the superior and the inferior Natures (Cf. VII. 4 and 5)\n\n the field and its knower. I unite these two (the Spirit and the matter). The individual soul comes under the influence of the limiting adjuncts\n\n viz.\n\n ignorance\n\n desire and action. On account of ignorance (Avidya)\n\n the individual soul forgets his original divine nature\n\n gets himself entangled in the meshes of desire (Kama) and action (Karma)\n\n and revolves in the wheel of birth and death. The individual soul turns towards ignorance without knowing his own true divine nature. The Jiva (individual soul) being overpowered by ignorance and the modifications\n\n forgets its pristine purity and moves in various forms.The Primordial Nature or the Unmanifested is a dark matrix with infinite potentialities. It is not a substance. Sound and energy are in an undifferentiated state in It. The whole world gets involved into It during the cosmic dissolution. There is no relationship of substance or ality between It and the three Gunas. The alities are the Mulaprakriti and the latter is the former in a state of poise or eilibrium. This manifested world of the three alities is compared to a twisted rope of three colours\n\n viz.\n\n white\n\n red and black. Each colour represents a Guna. Sattvic is white\n\n Rajas is red and Tamas is black. The three are not in a state of eilibrium in the manifested world.Water and the seed coming in contact with the earth produce sprouts which grow into trees. In the womb of Nature\n\n the seed develops into the eightfold elements -- earth\n\n water\n\n fire\n\n air\n\n ether\n\n mind\n\n intellect and egoism. The first fruit of the contact of Nature with the soul is the MahatTattva or intellect. From intellect mind is born from mind egoism from egoism\n\n the five elements.There are four classes of beings\n\n viz.\n\n Jarayuja\n\n Andaja\n\n Svedaja and Udbhijja. The Jarayuja is born of the placenta (viviparous). Human beings\n\n cows\n\n elephants\n\n horses\n\n etc.\n\n belong to this class. In this variety the five senses of knowledge exist. The Andaja is born of eggs (oviparous). In this variety the elements of wind and ether predominate. Lice come under the category of Svedaja they are born of sweat. In this variety fire and water predominate. Trees that are born of seeds are classified under the head Udbhijja in this variety earth and water predominate. (Cf.VII.6IX.17XV.7)",

Rajas comes next. Tamas is the lowest and the worst. The three alities indicate the triple mentality. They produce attachment in the individual souls\n\n delude them and bind them down\n\n as it were\n\n to Samsara. Just as the three conditions of childhood\n\n youth and old age are found in the same body\n\n so also the three alities inhere in the mind. The soul gets limited by identifying itself with body and the three alities. It is subject to birth and death and experiences happiness and misery\n\n pleasure and pain\n\n joy and sorrow till it realises its identity with the supreme Self.The word Guna is usually translated as ality. It does not signify property\n\n attribute or ality\n\n such as the blue colour of a cloth. Gunas are really the primary constitutents of Nature and are the basis of all substances. Therefore it is not proper to call them alities inhering in substances.If you want to attain freedom or perfection\n\n if you wish to become immortal\n\n you must rise above the modes of Nature. You must transcend the Gunas.If the water in the vessel is agitated\n\n the reflected sun in the water also appears to be agitated through Pratibimba Adhyasa (superimposition of reflection on water). Even so the pure unchanging Self appears to be bound by the alities of Nature through superimposition. In reality the Self is ever free and untainted. It is beyond them.The Gunas which are only forms of ignorance are ever dependent on the knower of the field. They bind\n\n fast\n\n as it were\n\n the knower of the field. They have him as the basis of their existence.A knowledge of the Gunas and their operation is very necessary. Only if you have this knowledge can you free yourself from their clutches.Mahabaho Mightyarmed with strong and sinewy arms reaching down to the kness. This is a very auspicious sign. Yogis and sages have such beautiful arms.These three Gunas are present in all human beings. No one is free from the operation of any one of the three alities of Nature. They are not constant. Sometimes Sattva predominates at other times Rajas or Tamas predominates.Sattva has the characteristic of effulgence. It is also harmony and goodness or purity. Rajas is passion or activity. Tamas is inertia or darkness.Analyse all phenomena in terms of these three. Know their characteristics. Stand as a witness of these alities. Do not identify yourself with them. Separate yourself from them. Become a Gunatita. You will attain Supreme Peace\n\n immortality and eternal bliss. (Cf.XIII.22)",

This is ignorance. An attribute of the object cannot belong to the subject. All the alities from desire to firmness (Cf.XIII.6) belong to the field. From ignorance\n\n nondiscrimination is born and so the individual self is not able to discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent\n\n the subject and the object.Knowledge is an attribute of the Antahkarana (inner instrument\n\n viz.\n\n mind\n\n intellect\n\n the unconscious and the ego) but not of the Self.

The more he acires\n\n the more passionate and greedy he becomes. Desires multiply. Nothing gives him satisfaction. If he is a millionaire\n\n he tries to become a multimillionaire. It is like petrol poured into the fire\n\n which inflames it further. A Rajasic man loses his understanding and power of discrimination. His understanding is clouded. He is under intoxication of the pride of wealth. His intellect is turbid. He has a perverted intellect. On account of perversion of intellect misery appears to him to be happiness pain appears to him to be pleasure sorrow appears to be joy. His goal is money and women. He worships mammon as his god.He runs after name\n\n fame and comforts and involves himself in endless activities. Quickness has been associated with the fish\n\n with the flash of lightning and with the glance of a woman. But Rajas is icker than these. A Rajasic man is more active than these. He thinks What will happen to me after my possessions are gone and thus worries himself unnecessarily and engages himself in endless activities. He has no peace of mind.He thirsts for what has not been attained and is attached to what has already been obtained. He wishes and tries to protect his possessions. This is Sanga. I will do such and such an action. I will get such and such a result. I will do this sacrifice. I will enjoy in heaven. This sort of clinging to action and its fruits is Karma Sanga.",

He does not think\n\n I am a vey learned man. When the impulse for action is awakened in the body or when there is a divine call for him to do work for the solidarity of the world (Lokasangraha) he does not hate any action and he does not regret it after the action is accomplished. He feels no remorse while performing actions. The work is like the play of a child. While inertia increases in him\n\n he is not deluded by infatuation.Only an ignorant man thinks Tamas has entered into me. I am deluded. I am under the influence of heedlessness\n\n torpor\n\n sloth\n\n laziness and indolence. Now I am under the influence of Rajas. I am forced to do activities. This is painful. I have fallen from my true nature. This gives me a lot of pain. Now Sattva predominates in me. I am attached to happiness and knowledge. I am proud of my learning and better status.The liberated sage who has transcended the Gunas does not thus hate them when they are present.A man of Sattva or Rajas or Tamas longs for light\n\n action or inertia which first manifested themselves and disappeared. But a liberated sage or one who has gone beyond the three alities does not at all long for these states which have vanished. This mark or characteristic is an internal mental state. It cannot be perceived or detected by others. It can be felt by ones own self alone. If one is endowed with clairvoyant vision or the inner eye of intuition\n\n he can directly behold the longins that arise in the mind of another man.In the following three verses the Lord gives His answer to Arjunas second estion What is the conduct of the sage who has crossed over the Gunas",

This peepul is said to be eternal because it cannot be cut except by the axe of knowledge.All persons depend upon the Lord for the fruits of their actions\n\n because He alone knows the right relation between the actions and their fruits. He alone is the dispenser of the fruits of actions of human beings. The wise persons also depend upon the Lord for the fruit of their knowledge. The Lord alone removes the veil of ignorance through His grace and mercy. The inclination for Advaita Vedantic Sadhana arises through the Lords grace. The desire for the realisation of the Oneness is produced in the minds of wise men by the grace of the Lord\n\n which is the antidote to all fears. (Avadhuta Gita\n\n I.1)Those who serve the Lord with unswerving or singleminded devotion go beyond the three alities of Nature through His grace. They attain knowledge of the Self through the grace of the Lord and get release from the round of birth and death. Those who have a right understanding of the real nature of Brahman or the Supreme Being also get emancipation easily.The Lord teaches Arjuna in this discourse about the real nature of Brahman or the Supreme Self and the path that leads the soul to union with Him. The Lord describes the nature of Samsara or worldly life as a peepul tree in order to create nonattachment or dispassion\n\n because he who is endowed with true and lasting dispassion alone is fit for attaining the knowledge of the Self. Samsara is compared to a tree. because it can be cut off like a tree.All the other trees have their roots below\n\n but this peculiar\n\n strange and most wonderful tree of Samsara (Maya) has its root above\n\n in Brahman. This peepul tree is different from all other trees. Brahman is the resting place or support of everything. It is eternal. It is great. It is the most high. It is the Supreme Being. It is supreme over all things. It is the source of everything. Therefore it is said that It is the One above. This One above is the root of this tree of Samsara. Brahan Who is superior to all is Urdhva. That which has Brahman as its cause is Urdhvamulam.In the Puranas it is said The tree of the Unmanifest has sprung from Brahman. Buddhi is its trunk\n\n the senseopenings are its hollows\n\n the great elements its boughs\n\n the senseobjects its leaves and branches\n\n Dharma and Adhrama (virtue and vice) its beautiful flowers\n\n pleasure and pain its fruits. Having cut asunder this tree with the powerful sword of the knowledge of the Self\n\n and then having attained to the eternal bliss of Brahman\n\n no one comes back from there again.Brahman is the root of this tree. It is the upper part of this tree and so It is called Urdhva. In reality there are no distinctions such as upward\n\n downward or middle in the One Which is the indivisible unity.The name Asvattha is usually derived from Asvattha which means not standing or enduring or remaining till tomorrow. A means not Sva means tomorrow Ttha means remaining. This is ite an appropriate word for this worldtree which is ever changing and passing away.In the Katha Upanishad also there is a mention about this Asvattha tree (II.6.1). The Gita is an essence of the Upanishads only.Samsara is generally understood by the common people as meaning remaining surrounded by ones wife and children and doing ones daily duties. This is a restricted or narrow meaning. Samsara means the whole worldprocess or the cosmic manifestation or the everchanging phenomenal world. Hiranyagarbha\n\n the individual souls\n\n the cosmic intelligence\n\n egoism\n\n the rootelements\n\n etc.\n\n represent the brancehs of this tree of Samsara. They extend downwards. They evolve into grosser and grosser states. Therefore it is said that the tree has its branches below. Egoism is the sprout which goes downwards in three directions\n\n viz.\n\n the three alities of Nature.Mind is the offshoot. Then come the five elements\n\n viz.\n\n earth\n\n water\n\n fire\n\n air and ether\n\n and the five organs of knowledge. Then comes sound which stimulates the ears to hear sweet music. Then comes touch which stimulates the skin to enjoy soft things. Then comes form which stimultaes the eye to behold beautiful objects. Then comes taste which stimulates the tongue to enjoy palatable things. Then comes smell which stimulates the nose to enjoy fragrant and scented objects.From the roots of actions with expectation of fruits a new branch of rirth comes up. The mineral kingdom\n\n the vegetable kingdom\n\n the animal kingdom and the human kingdom are all branches of this tree of Samsara. Man does good and evil actions with the help of the body and takes births to experience the fruits thereof. The human body is the water for this tree of Samsara.The body itself is the peepul tree. The root is the cerrospinal nervous system (brain). The various nerves are the branches that ramify downwards to the various organs distributed over the body.Avyaya Eternal\n\n because this tree rests on an unbroken seires of births without beginning and end it is thus eternal. It can be cut down by the sword of knowledge of Brahman. Just as the leaves of a tree protect it\n\n so also the Vedas protect this tree of Samsara\n\n treating of virtue and vice\n\n with their causes and fruits.He who knows this tree of Samsara and its roots as described above is a knower of the Vedas. He is a knower of the teachings of the Vedas. Not even an iota remains to be known beyond this tree of Samsara and its root. He who knows it is omniscient. The Lord has eulogised the knowledge of the tree of Samsara and its root in order to encourage aspirants to acire this knowledge.",

The sprouts of this marvellous tree are the charming objects of the senses with their characteristics of sound\n\n touch\n\n colour\n\n taste and smell. The roots\n\n the Karmic tendencies from the past lives\n\n grow downwards to generate the bonds of Karma in the world of men. These roots strengthen the bondage by further actions.The primal root is ignorance from which arises the eightfold Nature -- the five elements\n\n mind\n\n intellect and egoism. From the stem of the tree spring four branches called Svedaja\n\n Andaja\n\n,Jarayuja and Udbhijja. Eightyfour lakhs (eight million and four hundred thousand) of species came into being.One branch shoots straight upwards. This is the branch of Dharma which yields the fruit of enjoyment in heaven. Another branch is the branch of dispassion which yields the fruit of Selfrealisation. The sun\n\n the planets\n\n the manes and the sages have also come out of this wonderful tree. Above them are the branches of the worlds of Indra and the gods. Still higher are those of the sages and the men of austerities and penance. Still higher is the Satyaloka where Hiranyagarbha dwells.From man down to the immovable objects below and from him up to the realm of the Creator above\n\n whatever regions are attained in accordance with the nature of knowledge or action\n\n they are the ramifying branches of the tree of Samsara. They are nurtured and fattened by the three Gunas which form their material base.The senseobjects such as sound\n\n touch\n\n colour\n\n taste and smell represent the buds that sprout from the branches of the physical bodies which are the products of actions.The highest root of this wondeful tree is Brahman. The secondary roots are the latent impressions (Samskaras) of likes and dislikes\n\n which spread in this world of men and impel them to perform virtuus and vicious actions and bind them fast to actions.Now listen to the way by which this tree can be cut off. Only he who thus cuts his bondage to this tree of Samsara can be happy even in this world. He has the highest wisdom because he stands as a spectator of this tree and knows it as it is\n\n without being tied to it.",

Nothing else is needed for illuminating the Supreme Being because It is selfluminous.Dhama paramam Supreme abode or superexcellent seat or Para Brahman.Though the sun is endowed with the power of illumining all\n\n it cannot illumine the Supreme Being.यत् धाम वैष्णवं पदं गत्वा प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते यत् च सूर्यादिभिः न भासयते तत् धाम पदं परमं मम विष्णोः।That abode\n\n to which having gone\n\n none returns\n\n and which the sun\n\n moon\n\n stars\n\n lightning and fire do not illumine\n\n is the highest abode of Vishnu.(Cf.VIII.21)",

The individual soul is a ray of the Lord. A ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature\n\n draws to itself the five senses and the mind and becomes an embodied soul (Jiva) by assuming a body. Here is a description of how the subtle body or LingaSariria enters the gross body.Although the sun is reflected in water\n\n it is not in any way tainted. When a crystal comes in,contact with a red cloth or red flower\n\n it seems to be red but it is really not so. Even so the Supreme Beings is not in any way tainted by the actions of the individual soul.Ignorance is the limiting adjunct of the individual soul. On account of the limitation caused by this ignorance the soul experiences that it is the doer and the enjoyer. In essence the individual soul is identical with the Supreme Being or Brahman. When ignorance\n\n the limiting adjunct or principle\n\n is destroyed\n\n the individual soul (Jiva) realises it identity with the Supreme Being (Brahman).Just as the ether in the pot becomes one with the universal ether when the limiting adjunct\n\n the pot\n\n is broken\n\n so also the individual soul becomes one with Brahman when the limiting adjunct\n\n ignorance\n\n is annihilated. Just as there is no return of the potether after it has become one with the universal ether when the pot is destroyed\n\n so also there is no return of the individual soul after the limiting adjunct (the Antahkarana\n\n i.e.\n\n mind and the other inner instruments) is destroyed. It becomes one with Brahman.Pratibimba (reflection) is only a portion of the Bimba (object). The reflected sun is only a portion of the real sun (the rays of the sun). When the water is removed the reflected sun goes back to the original sun\n\n as it were. It does not return to the water again. Even so\n\n when ignorance or the mind is annihilated\n\n the Jiva (individual soul) which is a reflection of Brahman in ignorance is absorbed in the Bimba Brahman. It does not return to this world of birth and death.The individual soul is only an imaginary or fictitious portion of Brahman. It is not a real portion. For the Supreme Being is indivisible. It has no parts. If It has parts\n\n It would be liable to destruction when the parts are disjointed or removed.The senses abide in Nature\n\n in their respective seats such as ear\n\n skin\n\n tongue\n\n eye and nose. A Sannyasi living in the caves of the Himalayas dreams that he is a married man and moves about hither and thither to get a job for his livelihood. Even so\n\n the individual soul forgets its real divine nature\n\n mistakes the impure\n\n perishable body for the pure\n\n immortal Self and imagines that it is the real actor and enjoyer by identifying itself with the body. It says\n\n I am the Karta. I am the Bhokta. I am a soul bound by Samsara. I am happy. I am miserable. It becomes finite.In essence the Jiva is identical with Brahman. The difference is on account of delusion or imagination or superimposition. The illusion of difference is due to the limiting adjunct or principle (the mind) even as the illusion that the ether in the pot is different from the universal ether is caused by the limiting adjunct\n\n viz.\n\n the pot. Jivabrahmabhedabhranti (the delusion of the distinctior between the individual soul and the Supreme Being) is removed when the limiting adjunct (mind) is annihilated. In deep sleep the mind rests in a subtle state along with all the Samskaras (impressions) and Vasanas (tendencies) in its cause (primordial ignorance). Again it comes back from this state of ignorance when you return to the waking state. If the cause (ignorance) is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self\n\n its effect (mind) is also annihilated.Just as the tortoise stretches out its head and feet which were in a state of Laya (absorption) in its body\n\n so also the individual soul strecthces out its mind and senses which were in a state of absorption in primordial ignorance in deep sleep\n\n to enjoy the sensual objects in the waking state.A ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature\n\n draws to itself the five senses and the mind In this verse the formation of the astral body (LingaSarira or Sukshmasarira) is described.The Sruti declaresस एष इह प्रविष्टः आनखाग्रेभ्यः तत् सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्।।That Supreme Being Itself\n\n having created this aggregate of the body from the head to the toe\n\n entered this body in the form of the Jiva.According to Vedanta there are nineteen principles\n\n viz.\n\n the five organs of knowledge\n\n the five organs of action\n\n the five vital airs (Prana\n\n Apana\n\n Vyana\n\n Samana and Udana)\n\n the mind\n\n intellect\n\n Chitta (the subconscious or the unconscious mind)\n\n and egoism. We will have to conclude that the words the five senses and the mind point to the collection of the remaining thirteen principles also.Amsa This does not mean here a particle or portion which has been cut out. It is like the Amsar of the ether in the pot the ether is not cut out but still remains the whole ether. (Cf.XIV.3)",

One is the individual soul called the perishable\n\n the second is the imperishable or the Maya Sakti of the Lord and the third is the Purushottama or the Supreme Being.The perishable comprises the whole world of changing forms. From Brahma down to the tiny blade of grass\n\n all movable and immovable objects\n\n all that can be thought of by the mind\n\n all that is made up of the five elements\n\n all that is changing\n\n all that has names and forms\n\n all that appears to the naked eye and what is described as the body and the modifications of the field\n\n in the thirteenth chapter\n\n are Kshara or the perishable. Kshara is the changing one. It is the everchanging form of matter which is inert or insentient. Akshara is the changeless.In Samsara there are two categories arranged in two separate groups of beings\n\n called Purushas\n\n as they are the limiting adjuncts of the Purusha. Maya Sakti\n\n the illusory power of the Lord\n\n is the seed from which the perishable being takes its birth. It is the seat of all the latent impressions of desires\n\n actions\n\n etc.\n\n of various perishable creatures. Maya Sakti is the Akshara Purusha. The unmanifest condition is generally described as deep ignorance or sleep for there is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is only a potential state. It is the condition in which all forms of life with its accompanying limitations lie latent\n\n just as the tree lies latent in the seed of the fruit. In this state matter and energy are one. In this state sound\n\n matter and energy exist in an undifferentiated state. In this state the Gunas exist in a state of eilibrium.The imperishable is known as the Kutastha\n\n i.e.\n\n that which remains immovable like a heap. That which is at the root (Kuta) of all these beings is the Kutastha. Or\n\n Kuta also means illusion\n\n and Kutastha means that which manifests itself in diverse forms of illusion. That which conceals the Truth and shows the false thing and deceives the worldyminded people is Maya or Kuta. That which is of the form of the AvaranaVikshepa Sakti (veiling and vacillating power) is Kutastha. As this Maya Sakti cannot be destroyed except by the knowledge of the Self\n\n it is said to be endless. That is the reason why this is called Akshara. That seed of Samsara has no end. Therefore\n\n it is said to be imperishable in the sense that it is not destroyed in the absence of knowledge of the Self. But the seed is scorched or destroyed in toto when one gets the knowledge of Brahman. The,illusion vanishes and everything is realised as the one Cosmic Consciousness. Only the illusory perception of matter is destroyed.Purushottama or the highest Purusha is distinct from these two -- the perishable and the imperishable. He is not affected by the evils of the two vehicles or limiting adjuncts of the perishable and the imperishable. He is eternal\n\n pure\n\n intelligent and free by nature.",

If this most profound teaching is rightly understood\n\n known or realised\n\n it makes a man wise and gives him illumination. After this there is nothing left for him to know or strive for. He has reached the goal of life or the aim of human existence. He has arrived at the end of his journey. His endeavour for Selfrealisation is over. He has attained perfection. He has complete knowledge of the Supreme Being. He gets Brahma Jnana. He moves in the consciousness of the Divine. He beholds the Self everywhere. He lives in Brahman. He regards all activities as His divine play.When one realises Brahman\n\n he has discharged all the duties of life. He is liberated from the bonds of Karma. He becomes a Jivanmukta or illumined  sage who has transcended the bodyconsciousness\n\n the three alities of Nature\n\n the three states of consciousness (wakeful state\n\n dream and deep sleep)\n\n the pairs of opposites and the cycle of birth and death. He knows fully well that rirth has been destroyed\n\n that what has to be done has been accomplished\n\n that lifes highest goal has been reached and that he has nothing more to do or to learn. He has understood the profound mystery of life -- the riddle of this universe. He is a Sarvavit or allknower.The whole of the Gita is called science\n\n yet the fifteenth discourse alone is here declared as the science for the sake of eulogising it. The fifteenth discourse contains the intessence of the Gita\n\n the Upanishads and the Vedas. This is the butter churned from the milk of the Vedas. It has been said that\n\n He who knows the peepul tree knows the Veda (XV.1). The Lord has also said\n\n It is I Who am to be known by all the Vedas (XV.15). Only when a man knows this science as taught above does he become wise -- but not otherwise. Whatever duty a Brahmana of the highest birth has to do\n\n all that has been doen when one attains the knowledge of the Self. All actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge (IV.33). This is the fulfilment of the birth\n\n particularly of a Brahmana because the twicorn accomplishes all his duties only by attaining to this\n\n but not otherwise\n\n says Manu Smriti.As you have heard from Me this truth about the Supreme Being\n\n you are a happy man and you have done all your duties you have attained Selfrealistion.By using the words Anagha and Bharata\n\n Lord Krishna hints that even when an ordinary man who knows this fifteenth discourse can attain knowledge of the Self and become a Kritakritya\n\n then what to say of Arjuna who was sinless and who was born in a noble family with divine attributes The Lord\n\n by using the word Anagha\n\n also indicates that the Guru who is a knower of Brahman should instruct the most profound secret (the science of the Self) only to alified persons who are free from impurities of the heart or tossing of the mind\n\n who are calm and endowed with the four means of salvation. The man of impure mind will not be able to grasp the truth. The sinful man with his perverted intellect will distort the truth and thus pave the way for the destruction of himself and his followers.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita\n\n the science of the Eternal\n\n the scripture of Yoga\n\n the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna\n\n ends the fifteenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Supreme Spirit.   ,,",

He now describes them in detail in this discourse. The distinction between the god or the godman and the Asuras is clearly drawn in the first\n\n second\n\n third and fourth verses. Daivi Prakriti or the nature of the gods leads to Moksha or release from the round of birth and death. The nature of the Asuras and Rakshasas leads to bondage. This is an obstacle to the attainment of knowledge of the Self. The divine nature must be accepted and cultivated the Asuric and Rakshasic nature should be abandoned. All these alities are found in human beings. There are Sattvic people who possess the divine attributes there are Asuras and Rakshasas among human beings also\n\n who are endowed with demoniacal alities\n\n who are filled with excessive Tamas. In an ordinary man there is a mixture of the three Gunas. Tamas and Rajas pull a man downwards Sattva lifts a man upwards. Tamas and Rajas lead to bondage Sattva helps to attain salvation. Discipline yourself and develop Sattva This is the foundation of Yoga. This is the first preparatory discipline. The first rung in the spiritual ladder is reached by developing Sattva. When the mind is Sattvic\n\n thee is calmness in it. Divine light can descend only when the mind is serene and cheerful.The Sattvic man controls the senses\n\n does selfless service\n\n and practises Japa\n\n Pranayama\n\n concentration\n\n meditation\n\n selfanalysis and eniry of Who am I He is not attracted by sensual objects. He has a burning desire for attaining Moksha. He is humble\n\n generous\n\n merciful\n\n forbearing\n\n tolerant and pious. He destroys his little personality. The Rajasic man is proud\n\n intolearnt\n\n egoistic\n\n selfsufficient\n\n lustful\n\n hottermpered\n\n greedy and jealous. He works for his own glory and fame and selfaggrandisement. he develops his own little vain personality.There is intimate connection between the Gunas and Karmas. The nature of the Karmas depends upon the nature of the Gunas. A Sattvic man will do virtuous actions. A Rajasic and Tamasic man will perform evil actions. It is the Guna that goads a man to do actions. The Self or Brahman is actionless. It is the silent witness.The Lord sums up in the first three verses the alities of a godly man who is inclined to the path of liberation. He then enumerates the alities of the demoniacal man. The theme of this chapter is the tracing of the difference between the divine and the Asuric nature.Virtue and vice are relative terms. The virtue of one period will become the vice of the other. From the transcendental point of view\n\n there is neither virtue nor vice.Why should there be evil How did evil arise -- these are all transcendental estions (Atiprasnas). You can get answers to these estions only when you attain Selfrealisation. People unnecessarily rack their brains to get an answer to these estions. It is a serious mistake.Daivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine alities) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self. The Sattvic or divine attributes such as fearlessness\n\n purity of heart\n\n control of the senses\n\n etc.\n\n constitute Daivi Sampat. They enable the aspirant to attain the highest state of superconsciousness (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) wherein the seer and the seen are united in one\n\n the meditator and the meditated become identical. Divine alities or attributes which go to augment the bliss of the Self\n\n which help the aspirant to attain the happiness of the Self\n\n are called divine,wealth.Among the divine alities\n\n fearlessness stands foremost. Fear is an effect of ignorance. Identification with the body causes fear. Blind attachment to the body\n\n wife\n\n children\n\n house or property is the cause of fear. The sge who has realised the Self is absolutely fearless.He who knows the Bliss of Brahman from which words as well as the mind turn powerless\n\n fears nothing. (Taittiriya Upanishad)Fearlessness is the devout observance of the precepts enjoined in the scriptures without doubting. The state of being free from the fear\n\n How can I live now when I have renounced everything\n\n when I have none to support me is fearlessness. A Sannyasi resolves when he takes Sannyasa\n\n I will not induce fear in any living creature. Keeping up this resolve of Abhaya Dana (gift of the boon of fearlessness to all creatures) in thought\n\n word and deed is Abhayam or fearlessness. Fear can be removed by constant thinking of the immortal and allblissful nature of the Self. If you lead a life of honesty and truthfulness\n\n if you devoutly observe the precepts of the scriptures without doubting\n\n if you lead a life of right conduct\n\n and if you remember God always\n\n you will become fearless. When one beholds the Self only everywhere\n\n when the sense of duality has vanished\n\n when the sense of unity has dawned in him\n\n how can he be afraid of anything\n\n how can the feeling of fear arise in him Fearlessness is essential for the attainment of Moksha or salvation. Fearlessness is the chief characteristic of a liberated sage. It is the one accurate measure of ones spiritual progress. It is the cardinal virtue of an illumined sage. That is the reason why it is placed in the forefront of all divine alities. Only a liberated sage can be absolutely fearless.Sattvic Subha Vasana (good tendency) is Daivi Sampat. It induces a man to practise discrimination\n\n dispassion\n\n control of the mind and the senses\n\n etc.\n\n which help him to attain knowledge of the Self. The Rajasic and the Tamasic (Asubha or evil) Vasnas (tendencies) which operate along the currents of RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes)\n\n which induce one to perform actions which are prohibited by the scriptures and which produce disastrous effects\n\n constitute demoniacal nature.In Asuric nature inclination towards sensual pleasures is predominant in Rakshasic nature hatred predominates and the Rakshasa does various sorts of harm and injury to others.Good tendencies lead to Moksha. Evil tendencies lead to bondage. Good tendencies must be cultivated. Evil tendencies should be eradicated. You shoul first have a knowledge of the essential nature of these two Vasanas\n\n if you wish to cultivate the good tendencies and eradicate the evil ones. This sixteenth discourse gives a vivid description of these tendencies.Sattvasamsuddhih Purity of understanding\n\n cleanliness of life or purity of heart. Purity of mind\n\n i.e.\n\n giving up of cheating\n\n hypocrisy\n\n untruth and the like\n\n in all dealings with the people\n\n and doing transactions with perfect honesty and integrity is Sattvasamsuddhi.When the understanding abides constantly in the immortal Self and is thus firm and steadfast\n\n you may know this to be a condition of purity. On account of purity the mind can know the Self. The state of the mind wherein it is free from doubts like Asambhavana (thought of improbability of the existence of the Self)\n\n etc.\n\n through hearing of the scriptures is Sattvasamsuddhi. As purity of mind cannot be obtained without devotion to the Lord\n\n devotion is implied in these Sattvic virtues.Jnana Knowledge understanding the nature of the Self\n\n as taught in the scriptures and by the preceptor Selfrealisation through meditation on the Great Sentence of the Upanishad. I am Brahman (Aham Brahmasmi)\n\n is Jnana.Yoga is union of the individual soul with the Supreme Being it is the direct realisation of the Self by concentration and meditation\n\n through selfrestraint or control of the senses. The aspirant cognises through direct perception by the inner eye of intuition or wisdom what has been learnt from the scriptures and the preceptor. The aspirant attains Selfrealisation or direct knowledge. He becomes one with Brahman -- the Absolute. He gets indirect knowledge or mere understanding or theoretical knowledge of Brahman from the scriptures. Now through the practice of Yoga he gets direct knowledge. The attempt which is favourable for the annihilation of the mind and the latent tendencies is also known as Yoga.Jnanayogavyavasthitih The state of Jivanmukti attained through Jnana Yoga\n\n which is distinct from the state of the worldlyminded persons.Fearlessness\n\n purity of heart and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga are the three preeminent virtues amongst the Sattvic attributes enumerated in verses 1 to 3. They are found in Jnana Yogins only. The other alities are common to Jnana Yogins\n\n Karma Yogins\n\n Raja Yogins and Bhaktas. Unless you possess Sattvic virtues\n\n you cannot practise any kind of Yoga. If you cultivate one virtue\n\n all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Fearlessness is the basis and foundation of the whole of mans moral structure within.Svadhyaya and Tamas constitute Kriya Yoga. Svadhyaya constitutes BrahmaYajna. Almsgiving and sacrifice pertain to Karma Yoga. Almsgiving\n\n selfcontrol and sacrifice constitute Daivi Sampat for householders. Those alities mentioned in chapter XVI\n\n verses 1 to 3\n\n which belong to the aspirant who practises a particular form of Yoga constitute the Daivi Sampat of the disciple on that path.Dana Almsgiving distributing food\n\n clothes\n\n etc.\n\n as far as it iles in ones power\n\n according to ones means. A charitable man hastens to comfort the distressed and helps the needy. Charity is of three kinds\n\n viz.\n\n Sattvic\n\n Rajasic and Tamasic (see chapter XVII\n\n 20 to 22). It opens the gates of heaven. It will bring nearer the means of liberation. Just as the tree gives fruit and shade without distinction\n\n so also give to him who needs\n\n without distinction\n\n with a cheerful heart.Dama Selfrestraint\n\n selfcontrol\n\n control of the external senses. The control of the inner senses or the mind is described in the next verse.The practice of selfcontrol annihilates the union between the senses and the sensual objects. It separates the senses from their respective objects. The aspirant will not allow the wind of the sensual objects to blow through the gateway of his senses. He keeps the senses under the strictest restraint. He lights the fire of dispassion at all the ten gates of the body. He takes rigid vows. He observes Mauna (the vow of silence) and celibacy. He is moderate in his diet. He keeps the golden medium in everything. He checks the outgoing tendencies of the mind and the senses. He induces the mind and the senses to turn backwards towards their source. Just as an enemy is cut down by means of a weapon\n\n so also every tendency towards sensual objects is cut down by the practice of selfcontrol. All internal promptings\n\n cravings and Vasanas should be burnt in the fire of renunciation\n\n at the ten gates of the senses. As householders cannot practise perfect control of the senses\n\n even moderation or regulated and disciplined life will constitute selfrestraint for them. The practice of selfcontrol includes forgiveness\n\n harmlessness\n\n truth\n\n steadiness and,patience.Yajna Sacrifice. The fireworship (Agnihotra) and the like enjoined in the Vedas and also the sacrifice to the gods (DevaYajna) or worship of the gods\n\n PitriYajna\n\n BhutaYajna\n\n ManushyaYajna and BrahmaYajna enjoined in the scriptures (Smritis).Svadhyaya Study of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.Tapas Austerity\n\n moritification of the body and other forms of penance. True Tapas is meditation on the Self. It is fixing the mind on Brahman or the Self. It is to separate oneself from the physical body and the other four sheaths and to identify oneself with the Absolute. It is to turn the mind towards the soul. The three kinds of Tapas mentioned in chapter XVII\n\n verses 14 to 16 come under this category.Arjavam Straightforwardness. This is conducive to the attainment of knowledge. The aspirant should always be candid\n\n upright or straightforward. Straightforwardness should be his constant attitutde. A just and truthful man alone can be straightforward. He is respected by the people. He is liked by all. He attains success in all his endeavours. He never hides facts or truth.",

Every man in this world comes under the one or the other of the two creations\n\n the divine and the demoniacal.Lord Krishna says to Arjuna\n\n I will now describe to thee the characteristics of those men who are endowed with the devilish alities. If you have an understanding of the demoniacal alities\n\n you will avoid them. The demoniacal nature is described in detail to the very end of this discourse.There is some reference in chapter IX\n\n verses 9\n\n 11 and 12\n\n to the demoniacal nature but as the description is incomplete it is completed in this discourse.The divine nature has been declared in detail by the blessed Lord in the previous chapters -- the state of a Sthitaprajna in chapter II\n\n the state of a Bhagavata in chapter XII and the state of a Trigunatita in chapter XIV and in the first three verses of this discourse.",

This is the source of all the defects and perversities in human nature and of all evil actions. Lust\n\n anger\n\n greed\n\n pride and hypocrisy are all attendants of egoism. It is very difficult to overcome this dire enemy\n\n but through Vichara (right eniry) it can be annihilated.These Asuras who are very egoistic on account of their deep ignorance esteem themselves very highly for the alities they possess and for those which they falsely superimpose upon themselves. They think that they are very great persons on account of the good alities which they have superimposed upon themselves and their egoism is increased thery. They try to humiliate others by using their financial supremacy. They will bribe people to give false evidence and do anything to attain their selfish ends.Balam Power accompanied by lust and attachment. The Asuras use their strength of body to humiliate and destroy others.

Powers or Siddhis are bound to come if one practises concentration of mind. If he is endowed with Yama\n\n he will never misuse them and so he will never have a downfall. That is the reason why Patanjali Maharshi says Powers are obstacles on the path of Yoga. Shun them ruthlessly. March onwards to the goal. Climb the ladder of Yoga till you attain the highest state of superconsciousness or Godconsciousness. Do not look back. Have no memories of the past.Yama is the very foundation of Yoga. Get yourself established in Yama before you take to concentration and meditation. Many aspirants get a downfall because they do not practise Yama to begin with. They jump at once to the practice of concentration and meditation. This is sad mistake.Darpa Haughtiness. A man whose heart is filled with haughtiness becomes very insolent and unjust and assumes an overbearing and domineering attitude towards others he never respects the elders\n\n Gurus and others. This is a peculiar vice that has its seat in the mind. When this evil ality manifests itself\n\n one swerves from the path of virtue.Krodha Anger manifests itself when one gets something unplesant and when he comes across something disagreeable.These Asuras hate Me\n\n the Lord Who dwells in their own bodies as the silent witness of their thoughts and actions. They think that I am also a human being and hate Me. They do not understand My allpervading and imperishable nature. They do not care at all to know and follow. My \n\nnds or the injunctions given in the Vedas and the Smritis. If anyone violates My \n\nnds given in the scriptures\n\n it is surely tantamount to an act of hatred towards Me. These people are very malicious. They have evil intentions or impure motives. They are jealous of those persons who are virtuous and who tread the path of righteousness. Their hearts burn when they notice good alities in others. This is Matsarya\n\n a form of jealousy. If a man superimposes evil alities on a virtuous man who is endowed with good alities\n\n this is Asuya. If his heart burns when he sees a wealthy or prosperous man\n\n this is Irshya.",

Faith assumes a threefold aspect under the influence of the three alities. When Sattva is strongly developed\n\n when there is a preponderance of Sattva or purity in a man\n\n it is easy for him to attain Selfrealisation or the knowledge of the Self. If Rajas is predominant\n\n the faith becomes the handmaid of activity. If Tamas or inertia prevails\n\n faith is annihilated.Those who are endowed with Sattvic faith aim at the attainment of liberation. Those who are endowed with Rajasic faith run after inferior duties or worldly activities. Those whose faith is Tamasic are cruel. They kill animals for sacrifice. They invoke the spirits and talk with ghosts. When faith is joined to Sattva\n\n it leads to salvation. When Rajas preponderates\n\n it colours the faith and leads to various activities. When Tamas predominates\n\n the faith results in darkness.Faith acires different alities when it is in company with the mind of man. Mind is a thing of many colours. Just as the water of the Ganga is contaminated by being put in a vessel where lior had been kept\n\n so also a virtuous person is spoiled by bad company or constant association with evil persons. The three Gunas or attributes colour the faith of a man. The mind of a man is governed by the preponderating attribute or ality which manifests itself when the other two alities are suppressed. Faith takes a threefold aspect in accordance with the inherent nature or tendencies of the man. The inclinations of men are moulded according to their ality or inherent nature born of their past Samskaras.As is the tendency\n\n so is the desire as is the desire\n\n so is the action as is the action\n\n so is the birth into another being after death. The body is like the seed of the tree\n\n a perpetual chain. Seed perishes in developing into a tree and the tree again produces the seed. This process or cycle continues eternally. Even so man takes a body\n\n does actions\n\n develops tendencies\n\n dies and puts,on a new body in accordance with the nature or tendencies. This continues till he gets knowledge of the Self by transcending the three Gunas\n\n when ignorance\n\n the root cause of birth and death\n\n is destroyed.Faith is born of the individual nature\n\n i.e.\n\n the Samskaras or the latent impressions of virtuous and vicious actions which were performed in the past births and which manifested themselves at the time of death. In the subconscious mind or the Chitta there is a reservoir of past impressions which are revived through the operation of memory.Sattvic Faith in the worship of gods\n\n which is an effect of Sattva.Rajasic Faith in the worship of the Yakshas and Rakshasas\n\n which is an effect of Rajas.Tamasic Faith in the worship of the disembodied spirits and ghosts\n\n which is an effect of Tamas.Faith is the main support of life. It is not mere intellectual belief or blind acceptance of pet dogmas or doctrines. You must understand clearly its characteristics\n\n just as you recognise a tree from the fruits\n\n the mind of a man from his speech\n\n and the actions of previous birth from worldly pleasures and pains.Svabhavaja Inherent in their nature born of past Samskaras.Tam Of it\n\n referring to the threefold faith.",

The practice of nonstealing and noncovetousness are also included in physical austerity.He who has realised I am Brahman is a wise man (Prajna). A Sudra also may be a wise man. Though Vidura was a Sudra he was a sage. That is the reason why the Lord has made a separate mention of the wise.Brahmacharya means control but not suppression of the sexdesire or sexforce. If the mind is filled with sublime thoughts by meditation\n\n Japa (repetition of a Mantra)\n\n prayer\n\n study of holy scriptures\n\n eniry of Who am I\n\n and contemplation of the sexless\n\n pure Self\n\n the sexdesire will be devitalised by the withdrawal of the mind. The mind also will be thinned out. Suppressed sexdesire will attack you again and again and will produce wetdreams\n\n irritability and restlessness of the mind. The mind should be rendered pure by meditation\n\n Japa\n\n singing of the Lords names\n\n and prayer. The mind should be controlled first. Then it will be easy for you to control the senses. That is the reason why the practice of Sama or the control of the mind comes first and then comes Dama or the restraint of the senses (in the order of the sixfold virtues. The senses cannot operate without the help of the mind. So the effective remedy for lust and the best aid to celibacy is to control the mind first and then the senses.Intense musing on the objects of the senses does more harm to the inner spiritual life than actual sensegratification. If the mind is not rendered pure by Sadhana\n\n mere mortification of the external senses will not produce the desired effect. Although the external senses are mortified\n\n their internal counterparts which are still energetic and vigorous\n\n revenge upon the mind\n\n and produce intense mental disturbance and wild imagination.To control the mind is diffcult for neophytes or the beginners. It will be extremely difficult to control the mind first when the senses are allowed to run riot. That is the reason why Lord Krishna says Therefore\n\n O Arjuna\n\n mastering first the senses\n\n do thou slay this thing of sin (desire)\n\n destructive of wisdom and knowledge. (Cf.III.41)The theory or doctrine that the mind should be controlled first is ite correct. This practice is intended for the firstclass type of spiritual aspirants. The middling type of students should control the senses first. The senses always have an outgoing tendency. The mind operates through the senses. Control of the one goes hand in hand with control of the other. Control of the senses is also control of the mind\n\n because the mind is a bundle of senses only there is no mind without the senses.Just as an enemy can be easily conered if you have a twopronged attack\n\n so also the mind can be controlled easily if you attack it on two fronts simultaneously -- an external attack on the senses and an internal attack on the mind itself by the eradication of the desires.To say\n\n Control the mind first\n\n you can control the senses (which is one point of view) or Control the senses first\n\n you can control the mind easily (which is another point of view) is simply arguing in a vicious circle like Which came first -- the tree or the seed or You will get the knowledge of the Self if you control all desires -- and you can control all the desires only if you have knowledge of the Self.You need not worry yourself over this seeming paradox. Try to do either of the practices\n\n viz.\n\n control of the mind or control of the senses\n\n according to your liking\n\n capacity\n\n taste and temperament. You can yourself find out by actual practice which is better. As you advance in your practice your doubtwill gradually disapperar and you will enjoy supreme peace and joy.",

The wise men declare that Tyaga means abandonment of the fruits of all the Nitya and Naimittika works (ordinary and extraordinary or occasional duties).The rootmeaning of the words Sannyasa and Tyaga is to give up. In popular usage Sannyasa and Tyaga are more or less synonymous. Both mean renunciation. The two words do not mean two altogether distinct ideas as stone and fruit\n\n or pot and cloth. They convey the same general idea with a slight distinction.An objector asks It is said that the Nitya and Naimittika actions cannot produce any fruits. Why then is the relinishment of their fruits mentioned here It is like asking for the relinishment of the barren womans sonWe say The objection is not correct. In the opinion of the Lord\n\n ordinary and occasional duties cause their own fruits (vide XVIII.12). Sannyasins alone who have renounced the desire for the fruits of actions will not get the fruits\n\n but other persons will have to reap the fruits of the ordinary and occasional actions.If one renounces all actions after the attainment of Selfrealisation and enters into the fourth order of life (Sannyasa) it is called VidvatSannyasa. If one renounces all actions and enters into the order of Sannyasa for the sake of doing VedantaVichara (or reflection on the truths of the Vedantaphilosophy and on the true significance of the great sentences of the Upanishads which reveal the identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Being) and for thus attaining Selfrealisation\n\n it is called VividishaSannyasa.",

He is not affected by either pleasure or pain. He is not elated at performing pleasant actions nor does he find unpleasantness when he does disagreeable actions. He does not hate the latter\n\n nor is he attached to the former. Neither has he aversion to painful actions nor attraction to pleasant ones. As he has no attachment to any action or its rewards\n\n he will do any action for the welfare of all beings.Akusalam Karma Disagreeable work or work done with expectation of reward\n\n which becomes the cause of bondage to Samsara\n\n by producing a body. He does not hate an unpleasnt action\n\n thinking\n\n Of what use is itKusale To good ones which include obligatory daily duties. He has no attachment to them even with the notion that they lead to salvation by purifying the heart and conseently giving rise to the dawn of knowledge and devotion to it.When one abandons attachment to action and desire for its reward and performs actions vigorously\n\n his heart is filled with Sattva or purity which produces discrimination between the Real and the unreal\n\n the Eternal and the transient. Then he attains knowledge of the Self which dispels all the doubts caused by ignorance. He now realises that the only means of attaining the spureme bliss or eternal peace or immortality is knowledge of the Self. This rends asunder all his doubts. What is the nature of doubt Does Brahman exist or not Do the Upanishads deal with Saguna Brahman or Nirguna Brahman Is the individual soul identical with the Supreme Being or not Will I be able to realise the Self or not Will any of the Karmas (Prarabdha\n\n Sanchita and Agami) affect me Does this Samsara whose nature is the feelings I do this and I enjoy this belong to the Self or to the mind and intellect What are the means for liberation -- Yoga\n\n devotion\n\n Karma or knowledge of the Self What is Moksha Is it Selfrealisation or the attainment of the Salokya\n\n Samipya\n\n Sarupya and Sayujya states (dwelling in the kingdom of God\n\n proximity to Him\n\n assuming the same form as the Lord and merging in Him)When a man practises Karma Yoga he gets purity of heart and through purity of heart knows himself to be the immutable actionless Self Who is destitute of birth\n\n or remains without acting or causing others to act (Cf.V.13). He attains devotion to the knowledge of the Self and freedom from all actions. The purpose of the Karma Yoga described above has been taught in this verse.Medhavi He who is endowed or united with wisdom. He is a Sthitaprajna. What is Medha\n\n then It is the immediate knowledge of the identity of the individual soul and the Supreme Being by meditation on the right significance of the great sentence (I am Brahman or That thou art)\n\n which,is free from the three kinds of doubts\n\n viz.\n\n Samsaya Bhavana (doubt)\n\n Asambhavana (improbability) and Viparitabhavana (perversion)\n\n and by the practice of the four means and service of the Guru (who is versed in the scriptures and established in Brahman) and hearing the truths from him.Such a Medhavi will not think that prohibited actions which bind an ignorant man will be unfavourable to him. He will never think that they will bind him if he has to perform them\n\n because he is above good and evil\n\n virtue and vice\n\n right and wrong. He has no idea of agency (Kartritva Abhimana) he feels that he is a Kritakritya\n\n one who has accomplished all actions.This does not mean that he will do wrong actions. As his will is one with the cosmic will\n\n whatever action he performs will be in accordance with the scriptures. He will never deviate even a fraction of an inch from the rules of the scriptures. The Lord alone works through his mind and senses as he has no individual will.RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes) are the motives that induce a worldly man to actions. As they are absent in a sage or a Medhavi\n\n he can renounce the fruits of all actions and actions as well.As the ocean remains calm amidst stormy waves\n\n even so a Sattvic man remains calm amidst adverse or stormy conditions of life. He recognises that the happenings of life are inevitable. He acts in a variety of ways but is not disturbed as he has a balanced and disciplined mind.There must be no hatred for unpleasant or disagreeable action that brings physical suffering\n\n danger or unlucky results or untoward conseences\n\n when it is the work that should be done. You will have to accept such work also with a willing heart and work with hear and soul. You must have a profound and comprehensive understanding of its need and meaning also. Arjuna failed to understand in the beginning the deep significance and need of the work given by the Lord. He brought in his own foolish philosophy. He failed to do his bounden duty because\n\n due to ignorance\n\n he thought it was an unpleasant or disagreeable action to kill people but in the end when his eyes were opened by the valuable teachings of the Lord\n\n he understood the need and the meaning of the work although it appeared to him as disagreeable and unpleasant in the beginning\n\n and said My illusion is destroyed.

He has no knowledge of the,actionless\n\n pure\n\n selfluminous Self.The ignorant man of untrained understanding identifies himself with the five causes and regards the pure actionless Self as the agent or doer of the actions which are really done by these five causes. What is the reason for this Why does he regard them so Because he is not endowed with a pure and subtle intellect his understanding (Buddhi) has not been trained in the practice of Vedanta he is not eipped with the four means of salvation his intellect has not been trained by the teachings of the preceptor or the spiritual teacher in the methods of logical reasoning.He who considers that the pure actionless Self is the agent or the doer is certainly a man of untrained understanding. He has no knowledge of the actionless Self and action. Therefore\n\n he is a man of perverted intelligence. His intellect works or moves in the wrong direction. His intellect moves in the sensual grooves or avenues. It runs like the vicious horse and leads to birth and death. The technie of Buddhi Yoga taught in the Gita enables one effectively to prevent this.He does not perceive or cognise the Truth though he has eyes. Though he sees\n\n he sees the external\n\n gross\n\n illusory\n\n everchanging\n\n perishable objects only. He does not behold the one immortal\n\n unchanging\n\n allblissful essence\n\n which is the basis or substratum of everything. He is like the man with jaundiced eyes\n\n who sees all objects tinged with yellow colur\n\n or like the man suffering from diplopia who beholds many moons\n\n or like the man who thinks that the moon moves when the clouds move\n\n or like the man who\n\n seated in a train\n\n imagines that the trees are moving when it is the train that is really moving.

He knows that the Self is not destroyed when the body perishes. He has no idea of agency. The act of killing itself\n\n in his case\n\n becomes one necessary for the peace and harmony of the world. His killing without desire is like the killing of a murderer by the executioner and the judge on behalf of the community for the preservation of peace and harmony in the world.He who has a trained intellect\n\n pure understanding and developed reason\n\n who has a knowledge of the scriptures\n\n who has devoted himself to the study of the scriptures\n\n who is eipped with the knowledge of logic\n\n who is well trained by the instructions of his preceptor\n\n is absolutely free from the egoistic notion that I am the agent or the doer. He knows perfectly well that Nature or Guna or ones own nature does everything. He thus thinks I am the silent witness of all activities. I am not the doer. These five (the body\n\n the actor\n\n etc.) which are superimposed on the pure\n\n actionless Self through ignorance are the causes of all actions. I do not do anything. The senses move amongst the senseobjects. The alities (Gunas) move in their counterparts in the senses which are also the products of the Gunas. I know the essence of the divisions of the alities and their functions. I am in essence without limbs. How can action or work be ascribed to me I am without hands\n\n without legs\n\n without feet\n\n without breath and without mind. I am ever pure\n\n spotless and immovable and immutable. He will never repent thus I have done a wrong action. I ought to have done like this. I have done an evil action. I will go to hell. He is always wise. He can,never do a wrong action. His will has become one with the cosmic will. His will has become blended with the will of the Lord. Whatever he does is done by the Lord only. He has no will of his own. He sees rightly. Though he kills\n\n he does not commit the act of killing. He is not bound by the fruit of a vicious action as an effect of that act. He is beyond good and evil\n\n beyond the pairs of opposites\n\n as he has knowledge of the Self.An objector says The statement that though he kills these people\n\n he does not kill\n\n is selfcontradictory.We say This objection is really not tenable. From the worldly point of view the Lord says though he kills\n\n because man identifies the Self with the body\n\n etc.\n\n and thinks I am the killer. From the transcendental point of view explained above\n\n the Lord says\n\n He kills not\n\n he is not bound.Another objector says The Self acts in conjunction with the body\n\n etc.\n\n -- He who looks upon his Self Which is isolated\n\n as the agent৷৷.  (XVIII.16)We say This objection also cannot stand. As the omnipresent ether is not affected by reason of its subtlety\n\n even so the Self\n\n seated everywhere in the body\n\n is not affected. This immortal\n\n immutable\n\n changeless\n\n formless\n\n attributeless Self\n\n though seated in the body\n\n does not act and is not affected\n\n just as the crystal is not affected by the red colour of the flower that comes into contact with it\n\n just as the sun is not affected by the diseases of the eye. A thing that changes only can join with others and become the agent. The Self is always isolated\n\n independent and free. This Self is immutable (II.25). The alities move amidst the alities (III.28). Though seated in the body\n\n He does not act (XIII.31). Actions are wrought by the alities (III.27). You will find in the Brihadaranyaka were. By reasoning also we may establish the same conclusion thusThe Self is indivisible\n\n allpervading\n\n infinite\n\n limbless\n\n without parts\n\n independent\n\n ever free and immutable. Therefore the actions of the body can never be ascribed to the agency of the Self.Verily the actions of one cannot go to another who has not done them. Just as blue colour cannot belong to the sky\n\n silver to the motherofpearl\n\n water to mirage\n\n so also what is ascribed to the Self by ignorance cannot really belong to It. The changes that occur in the body pertain to the body but not to the pure actionless Self which is always the spectator or the silent witness. Therefore\n\n it is right to say that the wise man who is free from egoism and all impurities of the mind\n\n neither kills nor is he bound though he kills.In chapter II.19\n\n the Lord stated the proposition -- He slayeth not\n\n nor is he slain. In chapter II.20\n\n He said The Self is unborn\n\n eternal\n\n ancient the Self is not slain when the body is killed. The Lord has touched here and there that the Self is not affected by works\n\n that there is no necessity for the wise man of doing actions. He concludes that the sage kills not\n\n nor is he bound\n\n and sums up the teaching of the Gita. The teaching of the Gita has been concluded in this verse. The Sannyasins who are free from egoism are not affected by Karma. The threefold fruits of action\n\n viz.\n\n evil\n\n good and mixed (see verse 12 above) do not accrue to them. Those worldlyminded persons who work with egoism and expectation of fruits are tainted by the works. They are forced to experience the fruits of their actions and to take birth again and again.

So he is serene. The nature of the Kshatriya is Rajas and Sattva. Sattva in his case is subordinate to Rajas. Rajas predominates. Therefore he possesses lordliness. The nature of the Vaisya is Rajas and Tamas. Tamas is subordinate to Rajas. So he does various sorts of activities or business to earn money. The nature of the Sudra is Tamas\n\n with subordinate Rajas. He is dull.Karma is action arising from and fashioned by past thoughts and desires. The Gunas cannot manifest themselves without a cause. Nature is the tendency\n\n Samskara or Vasana in living beings. This is acired by them in the past births. This manifests itself in the present birth and produces its effects. This nature is the source of the Gunas. Every man or woman is born with his or her own Svabhava (nature). The Gunas operate according to the respective natural tendencies of man which impel him to perform his own duties as their natural effects. The duties are allottted to the four classes or castes in accordance with the Gunas of individuals. (Cf.IV.13)",

Reason is the faculty of determination.Pure intellect The intellect that is free from lust\n\n anger\n\n greed\n\n pride\n\n doubt\n\n misconception\n\n etc. It is like a clear mirror. A pure intellect is Brahman Itself. It can be easily merged in Brahman. When the pure intellect is merged in Brahman\n\n the reflected intelligence\n\n Chidabhasa or Jiva\n\n is also absorbed in Brahman. The Jiva becomes identical with Brahman\n\n just as the ether in the pot becomes one with the universal ether when the pot is broken.The self The aggregate of the body and the senses.The aspirant withdraws the senses from their respective objects again and again through the repeated practice of Pratyahara (abstraction) and Dama (selfrestraint). Gradually the senses are fixed in the Self. Their outgoing tendencies are totally curbed. The aspirant attains supreme control of the senses by constant meditation\n\n by the practice of dispassion he coners Raga (attachment)\n\n and through the practice of pure love or cosmic love or divine Preme he coners hatred.He abandons all luxuries. He keeps only those objects which are necessary for the bare maintenance of the body. He has neither attachment nor hatred even for those objects which are necessary for that purpose.",

The spiritual vibrations in solitude are wonderfully elevating. Meditation will come by itself without exertion. All saints and sages who have attained Selfrealisation have remained in solitude for a number of years. You will have good meditation if you sit on the bank of a river\n\n in a cave or on the seashore or in a jungle. During the Christmas and Easter holidays you can all enjoy the peace of solitude. It is very necessary to live in solitude at least for a month or a fortnight in a year for the householders. Instead of wasting time\n\n energy and money in Calcutta or any other city\n\n during the holidays\n\n live in holy places like Rishikesh\n\n Uttarakasi or Naimisaranya drink the nectar of peace in such places by doing Anushthana (intense and systematic spiritual practice) or Japa of a Mantra and attain immortality. If you once taste the bliss of solitude you will never forget it. Every year you will attempt to taste it again. He who takes too much food (a glutton) is ite unfit for meditation or the spiritual path. Too much food will produce laziness\n\n a halfsleepy state and deep sleep also. Eat to live. Eat in moderation. You will have a light body and light\n\n cheerful and serene mind. This will help you in your practice of meditation. Observe Mauna or the vow of silelnce for a week or a month. Observe the vow for two hours daily. Control the body. Practise Ahimsa and Brahmacharya. Meditate on the Self or on the Lord Hari with four hands\n\n or on Lord Krishna\n\n Rama or Siva. Be regular in your meditation and gradually increase the period of meditation from 15 minutes to 3 or 6 hours at a sitting. If you are a wholetimed aspirant\n\n spend the whole time in meditation. If you are not able to do this\n\n do Likhita Japa (writing the Mantra) and Kirtan (singing the Names and glories of the Lord). Study religious books in the interval. Only advanced aspirants can meditate for a long time. Watch the mind and cultivate dispassion. Energy will leak out through the senses if you are careless and nonvigilant. If energy leaks out\n\n you cannot have good meditation. Dispassion is indifference to sensual enjoyments herein and hereafter\n\n absence of desire for visible and invisible objects. You must have steady\n\n lasting and sustained dispassion. It should not wane. It should be a constant attitude of the mind. You must be fully established in dispassion.In doing the Anushthana for 40 days live on milk and fruits or light diet. Take only 3 or 4 articles of food. Take one meal only. Sleep on the floor. Observe celibacy and the vow of silence. Do not come out of the room. Speak little if you do not observe perfect silence. Do the Anushthana on the banks of the Ganga or any sacred river. Try to do one or several Purascharanas of your Ishta Mantra. If there are five letters (syllables in English) in the Mantra\n\n 500\n\n000 repetitions of the Mantra will constitute one Purascharana.",

Knowing is attaining Selfknowledge. To know That is to become That. Entering is knowing or beoming That. Entering is the attainment of Selfknowledge or Selfrealisation. These are all jugglery of words only. Knowing and entering are synonymous terms. It is very difficult to understand or comprehend transcendental spiritual matters. The teachers use various terms or expressions\n\n analogies\n\n similes\n\n parables\n\n stories\n\n etc. to make the aspirant grasp the matter clearly and lucidly. Words are imperfect and languages are defective. They cannot fully express the inner spiritual experiences. The teacher somehow or other expresses to the students or aspirants these spiritual ideas. The aspirant himself will have to realise the Self. That is beyond the reach of words of expressions or analogies of similes. How can there be similes for that nondual Brahman These words are a sort of help or prop for the aspirants to lean upon in the beginning to understand spiritual matters.
