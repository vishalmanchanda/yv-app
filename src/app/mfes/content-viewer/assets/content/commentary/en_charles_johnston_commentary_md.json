        "explanation": "We are coming to a vitally important part of the teaching of Yoga: namely, the spiritual man’s attainment of full self-consciousness, the awakening of the spiritual man as a self-conscious individual, behind and above the natural man.\n\n In this awakening, and in the process of gestation which precedes it, there is a close relation with the powers of the natural man, which are, in a certain sense, the projection, outward and downward, of the powers of the spiritual man.\n\n This is notably true of that creative power of the spiritual man which, when embodied in the natural man, becomes the power of generation.\n\n Not only is this power the cause of the continuance of the bodily race of mankind, but further, in the individual, it is the key to the dominance of the personal l.\n\n Rising, as it were, through the life-channels of the body, it flushes the personality with physical force, and maintains and colours the illusion that the physical life is the dominant and all-important expression of l.\n\n In due time, when the spiritual man has begun to take form, the creative force will be drawn off, and become operative in building the body of the spiritual man, just as it has been operative in the building of physical bodies, through generation in the natural world.\n\n Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the nature of this force means, first, that rising of the consciousness into the spiritual world, already described, which gives the one sure foothold for Meditation; and then, from that spiritual point of vantage, not only an insight into the creative force, in its spiritual and physical aspects, but also a gradually attained control of this wonderful force, which will mean its direction to the body of the spiritual man, and its gradual withdrawal from the body of the natural man, until the over-pressure, so general and such a fruitful source of misery in our day, is abated, and purity takes the place of passion.\n\n This over pressure, which is the cause of so many evils and so much of human shame, is an abnormal, not a natural, condition.\n\n It is primarily due to spiritual blindness, to blindness regarding the spiritual man, and ignorance even of his existence; for by this blind ignorance are closed the channels through which, were they open, the creative force could flow into the body of the spiritual man, there building up an immortal vesture.\n\n There is no cure for blindness, with its consequent over-pressure and attendant misery and shame, but spiritual vision, spiritual aspiration, sacrifice, the new birth from above.\n\n There is no other way to lighten the burden, to lift the misery and shame from human l.\n\n \n\nTherefore, let us follow after sacrifice and aspiration, let us seek the light.\n\n In this way only shall we gain that insight into the order of the bodily powers, and that mastery of them, which this Sutra implies.",

        "explanation": "We are continuing the study of the bodily powers and centres of force in their relation to the powers and forces of the spiritual man.\n\n We have already considered the dominant power of physical life, the creative power which secures the continuance of physical life; and, further, the manner in which, through aspiration and sacrifice, it is gradually raised and set to the work of upbuilding the body of the spiritual man.\n\n We come now to the dominant psychic force, the power which manifests itself in speech, and in virtue of which the voice may carry so much of the personal magnetism, endowing the orator with a tongue of fire, magical in its power to arouse and rule the emotions of his hearers.\n\n This emotional power, this distinctively psychical force, is the cause of “hunger and thirst, ” the psychical hunger and thirst for sensations, which is the source of our two-sided life of emotionalism, with its hopes and fears, its expectations and memories, its desires and hates.\n\n The source of this psychical power, or, perhaps we should say, its centre of activity in the physical body is said to be in the cavity of the throat.\n\n \n\nThus, in the Taittiriya Upanishad it is written: “There is this shining ether in the inner being.\n\n Therein is the spiritual man, formed through thought, immortal, golden.\n\n Inward, in the palate, the organ that hangs down like a nipple, -this is the womb of Indra.\n\n And there, where the dividing of the hair turns, extending upward to the crown of the head.\n\n” Indra is the name given to the creative power of which we have spoken, and which, we are told, resides in “the organ which hangs down like a nipple, inward, in the palate.\n\n”",

        "explanation": "Here we have a splendid generalization, in which our wise philosopher finally reconciles the naturalists and the idealists, expressing the crown and end of his teaching, first in the terms of the naturalist, and then in the terms of the idealist.\n\n The birth and growth of the Spiritual Man, and his entry into his immortal heritage, may be regarded, says our philosopher, either as the culmination of the whole process of natural evolution and involution, where “that which flowed from out the boundless deep, turns again home”; or it may be looked at, as the Vedantins look at it, as the restoration of pure spiritual Consciousness to its pristine and essential form.\n\n There is no discrepancy or conflict between these two views, which are but two accounts of the same thing.\n\n \n\nTherefore those who study the wise philosopher, be they naturalist or idealist, have no excuse to linger over dialectic subtleties or disputes.\n\n These things are lifted from their path, lest they should be tempted to delay over them, and they are left facing the path itself, stretching upward and onward from their feet to the everlasting hills, radiant with infinite Light.",
